The bill supports the nation\'s global\neconomic competitiveness by authorizing the Corps to undertake\nprojects, programs and initiatives in their Civil Works program\nrelating to navigation, environment, flood risk management,\nhydropower, recreation, regulatory, emergency management, and\nwater supply. AWIA 2020 also facilitates our nation\'s water\ninfrastructure by creating and reauthorizing U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) water and wastewater programs under the\nClean Water Act (CWA).\nA Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), in this case AWIA\n2020, is the authorizing legislation for the programs and\nprojects of the Corps\' Civil Works program. Ideally enacted\nevery two years, such an act is the main vehicle for\nauthorizing water projects to be studied, planned, and\ndeveloped by the Corps. WRDAs typically include water resources\nprojects with completed reports, modifications to existing\nCorps projects, study authorizations for new projects, and\nmiscellaneous projects consistent with the Corps\' programs that\nalso demonstrate a federal interest. Activities fall within one\nor more of the Corps\' eight Civil Works business lines, which\ninclude navigation, environment, flood risk management,\nhydropower, recreation, regulatory, emergency management, and\nwater supply. In recent years, WRDAs have increasingly\nincorporated nature-based ``green\'\' infrastructure to solve\nproblems, in addition to traditional hard infrastructure (also\nknown as ``gray\'\' infrastructure).\nThe Committee\'s reported legislation for AWIA 2020 includes\nprovisions that will strengthen the United States\' economic and\nnational security, cut bureaucratic red tape, enable faster\nimplementation of projects, increase water supply reliability,\nquality and quantity, promote assistance to disadvantaged\ncommunities, reduce emissions, improve resiliency, address the\ngrowing impacts of extreme weather events, and upgrade our\nnation\'s water and wastewater infrastructure. The bill is\nbroken down into three titles:\nTitle I of AWIA 2020 addresses water resources development\nprojects within the Corps. Subtitle A includes a variety of\nsections pertaining to the Corps\' Civil Works program,\nincluding among others, those to comprehensively study areas\nimpacted by flooding in 2019, increase the ability of projects\nwith traditionally low Benefit-to-Cost Ratios (BCR) to compete\nfor funding, further regional sediment management activities,\nencourage the beneficial use of dredged material, and provide\ngreater flexibility for third-party entities and non-federal\nsponsors relating to Corps projects.\nSubtitle B authorizes critical feasibility studies and\nreports to be conducted by the Secretary of the Army, which has\noversight over the Corps. The Secretary, among other things, is\nalso authorized to expedite applicable decision documents for\nspecified projects, complete the review of specified\nsubmissions for consideration in the upcoming 7001 Report for\n2020, and provide technical assistance to a non-federal\ninterest of described project proposals during the required\nCorps outreach under section 7001(b) of the Water Resources\nReform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014).\nSubtitle C deauthorizes projects, and parts of projects,\nthat are no longer needed for a federal purpose, and prevents\nthe deauthorization of an environmental infrastructure\nassistance project or program of the Corps until September 30,\n2024.\nSubtitle D authorizes thirty new projects and modifies\nexisting projects based on reports submitted to Congress by the\nSecretary or the Chief of Engineers. These projects address all\nof the primary mission areas of the Corps, including: aquatic\necosystem restoration, flood risk management, hurricane and\nstorm damage risk reduction, navigation and water supply. This\nsubtitle also calls upon the Secretary of the Army to provide\npriority funding for and expedite the completion of specified\nprojects.\nSubtitle E authorizes the Corps to address both new water\nsupply programs and modifications to existing water supply\nstorage programs, and to improve the management of water\nstorage and reduce or prohibit specified related fees.\nSubtitle F helps the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)\nand the Corps to address new and existing invasive species\nmanagement through technical and financial assistance,\nresearch, innovation, and partnerships between the federal\ngovernment and other entities.\nTitle II authorizes water and wastewater infrastructure\nprograms under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also\nknown as the Clean Water Act (CWA). These programs focus on\nfinancial opportunities, construction, technical assistance,\nresiliency and efficiency. This title reauthorizes and\nstreamlines the Water Infrastructure and Finance Innovation Act\nloan program (WIFIA), reauthorizes existing grant programs, and\nestablishes new grant programs. Specifically, this title\nreauthorizes the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund (CWSRF)\nfor the first time since 1987. In addition, this title creates\na new discretionary grant program based on the CWSRF eligible\nprojects. This title also contains several provisions that\nfocus on the critical need of technical assistance, on-site\nspecialists and utility workers to help water systems achieve\nand maintain compliance. This title contains grant programs to\nassist small, rural, tribal and disadvantaged communities,\nfacilitate water access, promote water efficiency and improve\nwater system resiliency. This title also authorizes programs\nfor water reuse, water supply, and stormwater collection.\nTitle III contains several provisions regarding Tribes,\nregional restoration programs, studies and other miscellaneous\nitems. This title includes reauthorizations and modifications\nto existing Tribal programs, such as reauthorizing the Indian\nIrrigation Fund and increasing the Tribal Partnership Program\'s\nauthorization. This title also authorizes several regional\nrestoration or recovery programs such as those at San Francisco\nBay, the Great Lakes, Lake Tahoe and the Puget Sound. This\ntitle also includes grants to help ports reduce vessel\nemissions, and a requirement that EPA maintain and update an\nenvironmental justice mapping tool.\nThe Committee believes that it is important to account for\nchanging climate conditions in planning for resilience in\ncongressionally authorized Corps studies and projects. The\nCorps should continue to work with other federal agencies, such\nas United States Geological Survey and National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration, to account for sea-level rise and\nclimate-impacted considerations in plan formulation. Further,\nthis Committee believes that efforts should continue to\nexpedite the delivery of major infrastructure projects by\nreducing unnecessary and over-burdensome bureaucracy and\nredundancies, while still abiding by federal environmental\nprotection laws. These projects are vital to public safety, as\nwell as our nation\'s economic and national security.\nFurther, the Committee believes that the Corps of Engineers\nhas subsisted on programs that have historically been\nunderfunded for decades by the OMB. The Committee believes that\nOMB should prioritize adequate annual funding for the Corps to\nmitigate the need for supplemental funding and to further\nreduce the backlog of authorized but incomplete or not started\nprojects needed to protect our country.\nObjectives of the Legislation\nThe objectives of S. 3591 are to meet the nation\'s water\ninfrastructure needs, including for navigation, flood risk\nmanagement, and ecosystem restoration. It will help increase\nwater supply and storage and fight invasive species, while also\nfacilitating critical clean water and wastewater\ninfrastructure.\nSection-by-Section Analysis\nSec. 1. Short title; table of contents\nThis section states that this Act may be cited as the\n``America\'s Water Infrastructure Act of 2020\'\' and contains the\ntable of contents.\nSec. 2. Definition of Secretary\nThis section states that in this Act, the term\n``Secretary\'\' means the Secretary of the Army.\nTITLE I--WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT\nSubtitle A--General Provisions\nSec. 1001. Upper and Lower Missouri River comprehensive flood\nprotection studies\nThis section requires that the Secretary conduct two\ncomprehensive studies: one on the Upper and one on the Lower\nMissouri River. The Secretary must submit one comprehensive\nstrategy and report encompassing both to Congress on flood risk\nin areas affected by the severe flooding that occurred along\nthe Missouri River in 2019. The study shall include\nrecommendations on management plans and actions to be carried\nout by the responsible federal agencies; address whether\nchanges are necessary to the general comprehensive plan for\nflood control in the Missouri River Basin; and address whether\nthere are opportunities for increased non-federal management in\nthe Missouri River Basin. The study shall also include\nrecommendations for non-federal and federal action where\nappropriate, as well as follow-up studies for problem areas for\nwhich data or current technology does not allow for immediate\nsolutions.\nThis section authorizes $50 million in appropriations to\ncarry out this section, to remain available until expended.\nSec. 1002. Great Lakes comprehensive flood protection study\nThis section directs the Secretary to conduct a\ncomprehensive study, and submit a report to Congress, on\nshoreline protection and resiliency in areas affected by\nflooding in 2019 due to high lake water levels along the Great\nLakes.\nThis section requires that the Secretary address whether\nchanges are necessary to the management plan for the Great\nLakes, including plans for individual lakes of the Great Lakes;\naddress whether there are opportunities for increased non-\nfederal management in the Great Lakes; and include\nrecommendations on management plans and actions to be carried\nout by the responsible federal agencies.\nThis section authorizes $50 million in appropriations to\ncarry out this section, to remain available until expended.\nSec. 1003. Additional studies under North Atlantic Coast Comprehensive\nStudy\nThis section requires the Secretary to carry out a study to\ndetermine the feasibility of a hurricane and storm damage risk\nreduction project for any major metropolitan area\ngeographically located within the study area identified in the\nNorth Atlantic Coast Comprehensive Study that was not included\nas a high-risk focus area identified in the initial study. This\nstudy is a continuation of the previously authorized\ncomprehensive study.\nSec. 1004. Maintenance and construction of water resources development\nprojects by non-Federal interests\nThis section makes a technical correction to section 204(c)\nof WRDA 1986 that was caused by enacting section 1153 of\nAmerica\'s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (AWIA 2018) (Public\nLaw 115-270). Section 1153 was meant to allow a non-federal\nsponsor to advance projects more expeditiously using a\nstreamlined agreement with the Corps.\nAs written, the studies and engineering (i.e., technical\nassistance) portion of section 1153 of AWIA 2018 does not apply\nto any non-federal interest seeking federal assumption of\nmaintenance under section 204(f) of WRDA 1986. The studies and\nengineering portion of section 1153 of AWIA 2018, as enacted,\nonly applies to construction undertaken by a non-federal\ninterest under subsection 204(b) of WRDA 1986. The intent of\nsection 1153 of AWIA 2018 was to cover all non-federal interest\nwork under section 204 of WRDA 1986, not just construction.\nThis section makes that clarification.\nSec. 1005. Watercraft inspection stations\nThis section makes a technical correction to section 1170\nof AWIA 2018. Section 1170 of AWIA 2018 directs the Secretary\nto establish, operate, and maintain new or existing watercraft\ninspection stations intended to prevent the spread of aquatic\ninvasive species.\nSection 1170 of AWIA 2018 mistakenly referenced the\n``Arizona\'\' River Basin, instead of the ``Arkansas\'\' River\nBasin. This technical correction enacts the correct reference\nto the Arkansas River Basin.\nSec. 1006. Local government reservoir permit review\nThis section makes a technical correction to section 1119\nof AWIA 2018. This section was meant to require that the\nSecretary expedite the review of any application from a local\ngovernmental entity to expand a reservoir to accommodate\nprojected water supply needs of a city with a population of\nless than 80,000.\nSection 1119 of AWIA 2018 inadvertently included language\nlimiting the expedited review to permits at reservoirs ``owned\nor operated by the Secretary [of the Army]\'\'. This technical\ncorrection strikes that limitation so that local government\npermit applications at any reservoir are eligible for\nexpediting.\nSec. 1007. Upper Mississippi River protection\nThis section makes a technical correction to section 1225\n(``Upper Mississippi River protection\'\') of AWIA 2018. This\nsection directs the Secretary to accept and expend funds to\ncarry out the study that are contributed by a state or a\npolitical subdivision.\nWhile the body of this text references contributed funds,\nthe statutory reference under the Act of October 15, 1940 (33\nU.S.C. 701h-1) is to ``advance funds\'\' authority. This\ntechnical correction will strike the reference to ``the Act of\nOctober 15, 1940\'\' and insert ``section 5 of the Act of June\n22, 1936\'\' to ensure that the textual reference to contributed\nfunds and the citation are consistent with one another.\nSec. 1008. Beneficial use of dredged material\nThis section makes a technical correction to section 1148\nof AWIA 2018. That section incorrectly states that the\nSecretary may ``grant\'\' a temporary easement to facilitate the\nplacement of sediment if the Secretary determines it is in the\ninterest of the United States.\nThe Secretary does not ``grant\'\' easements for section 204\nbeneficial use projects. Instead, the Secretary may approve a\nnon-federal sponsor\'s plan to provide the necessary lands,\neasements, rights-of-way, relocations and disposal areas for a\nproject. This technical correction strikes the reference to the\nSecretary ``granting\'\' a temporary easement for the placement\nof sediment. Instead, the amended legislative language will\nreference that the Secretary may ``approve\'\' the use of a\ntemporary easement.\nSec. 1009. Klamath Basin Water Supply Enhancement Act of 2000 technical\ncorrections\nThis section makes a technical correction to the Klamath\nBasin Water Supply Enhancement Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2222; 132\nStat. 3887). Amending section 4(b) regarding water activities\nand drought response will facilitate agreements between the\nBureau of Reclamation and water supply contractors for\nassistance under the Klamath Basin Water Supply Enhancement\nAct.\nSec. 1010. Project modifications for improvement of environment\nThis section extends the period for which the Secretary is\nto give priority to projects that restore degraded ecosystems\nthrough modification of existing flood risk management projects\nauthorized under section 1135 of WRDA 1986 (33 U.S.C. 2309a)\nand located within the Upper Missouri River Basin until\nSeptember 30, 2026.\nSec. 1011. Non-Federal implementation pilot program\nThis section amends section 1043 of WRRDA 2014 (33 U.S.C.\n20 note; Public Law 113-121) to allow the Secretary to transfer\nfunds to a non-federal entity to do work on feasibility studies\nand projects. It also extends the date of the ability to\ncommence feasibility studies by non-federal interests from June\n10, 2019, to December 31, 2026. It also extends the associated\n$25 million authorization of appropriations per fiscal year for\nsuch feasibility studies through fiscal year 2026.\nIn addition, this section extends the date of the ability\nto commence project implementation under subsection (b) by non-\nfederal interests from June 10, 2019, to December 31, 2026. It\nalso lengthens the associated $25 million authorization of\nappropriations per fiscal year for such projects through fiscal\nyear 2026.\nSec. 1012. Thin layer placement pilot program\nThis section amends section 1122 of the Water\nInfrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016 (WIIN\n2016) (33 U.S.C. 2326 note; Public Law 114-322). It increases\nthe number of authorized projects under the beneficial use of\ndredged material pilot program from 20 to 40 projects, and\nrequires that ten of those projects must use thin layer\nplacement of dredged fine and coarse grain sediment for the\nmaintenance and restoration of wetlands.\nThis section also revises the pilot program to terminate\nafter 40 projects are completed.\nSec. 1013. Annual report to Congress on authorized studies and projects\nThis section requires the Secretary to develop an annual\nreport that identifies each authorized study or authorized\nwater resource development project submitted by non-federal\ninterests for consideration through the annual Energy & Water\nDevelopment appropriations bill. Criteria for inclusion in the\nreport include: projects that have been authorized by Congress;\nauthorized studies and non-operations and maintenance projects\nfor which the non-federal interest has entered into an\nappropriate agreement with the Corps; and demonstration of the\nlegal and financial capability to satisfy the requirements of\nlocal cooperation for the study or project.\nThe report must describe specified benefits for each\nauthorized study and authorized water resources development\nproject included in the annual report, as well as the name of\nthe associated non-federal interest; the purpose of the\nauthorized study or authorized water resources development\nproject; an estimate, to the maximum extent practicable, of the\nfederal, non-federal, and total costs of the authorized study\nor authorized water resources development project; and an\nestimate, to the maximum extent practicable, of the monetary\nand nonmonetary benefits of the authorized study or authorized\nwater resources development project.\nThis section requires the Secretary to include in the\nannual report an appendix listing the proposals submitted that\nwere not included in the annual report and a description of why\nthe Secretary determined that those proposals did not meet the\ncriteria for inclusion. The Secretary shall also make the\nannual report to Congress publicly available on the internet.\nThe Committee remains concerned that other annual reports\nfrom the Corps and OMB continue to be delayed, hindering the\nauthorization process. To address this concern, the Committee\nhas emphasized the requirement for the Corps and the Office of\nManagement and Budget (OMB) to provide this report annually, on\ntime, and consistent with criteria outlined in the bill.\nSec. 1014. Annual report to Congress on water resources infrastructure\nThis section amends section 7001 of WRRDA 2014 (33 U.S.C.\n2282d) by giving the Secretary the option to look at regional\nand local benefits, in addition to benefits to the national\neconomy.\nThis section also eliminates the restriction on new\nenvironmental infrastructure assistance programs or projects\nfrom being included in the annual report.\nThe Committee remains concerned that annual reports from\nthe Corps and OMB continue to be delayed, hindering the\nauthorization process, and further delaying important water\ninfrastructure work for the country. To address this concern,\nthe Committee has emphasized the requirement for the Corps and\nOMB to provide this report annually, on time, and consistent\nwith criteria outlined in law.\nSec. 1015. Operation and maintenance\nThis section amends section 204(f) of WRDA 1986 (33 U.S.C.\n2232(f)) to require that for a federally authorized harbor or\ninland harbor to have federal assumption of operation and\nmaintenance of improvements thereto, a non-federal sponsor\nshall submit to the Secretary a report on the improvements\ncarried out by the non-federal sponsor. This section clarifies\nthat the report must include an economic justification for the\nimprovements; details of the project improvement plan and\ndesign; proposed arrangements for the work to be performed;\ndocuments relating to any applicable permits required for the\nproject improvements; and that the Secretary must make a\ndetermination within 180 days after the date on which the\nSecretary receives the report on the improvements.\nSec. 1016. Transparency and accountability in cost sharing for water\nresources development projects\nThis section amends section 1120 of AWIA 2018 (33 U.S.C.\n2315b). It requires the Secretary, in the case of a beach\nnourishment project for which funds in excess of the amount\nneeded to complete the nourishment cycle in the current fiscal\nyear have been contributed by a non-federal sponsor, to either\ntransfer excess non-federal funds back to the non-federal\nsponsor upon its request; or to transfer the excess to pay the\ncost-share for other projects carried out by the Secretary for\nwhich the non-federal sponsor is the same.\nSec. 1017. Continuing authority programs\nThis section establishes a cost-share waiver for ``small\'\'\nor ``disadvantaged\'\' communities seeking to carry out a project\nunder a continuing authority program (CAP) with the Corps.\nThe Secretary may apply the waiver to a maximum of 50\nprojects in small communities and 50 projects in disadvantaged\ncommunities. No more than three projects in each category\nwithin any one Corps District can qualify for the waiver. This\nsection also increases authorized annual appropriations for all\nCAP programs, and allows for a 20 percent federal funding limit\noverage, per project, on a case-by-case basis.\nSec. 1018. Shore damage prevention or mitigation\nThis section amends section 111 of the River and Harbor Act\nof 1968 (33 U.S.C. 426i) by giving discretion to the Director\nof the USFWS to allow a non-federal interest to satisfy all or\npart of its cost-share for a shore damage or mitigation project\nby using funds from the USFWS.\nSec. 1019. Sediment management plan\nThis section requires that within one year of enactment of\nthis Act, the District Commander of each Corps District that\ncarries out any dredging activity for navigation or other water\nresources development project purposes develop, at full federal\nexpense, a five-year sediment management plan for submission to\nthe Secretary. A District Commander must provide notice and an\nopportunity for public comment, as well as make the plans or\nrevisions publicly available. The Secretary has to transmit the\nplan or revision to a plan, as applicable, to Congress.\nSec. 1020. Criteria for funding environmental infrastructure projects\nThis section requires that the Secretary develop written\ncriteria to rank environmental infrastructure projects for\npurposes of prioritizing funding. Subsection (a) requires a\nminimum criteria for all environmental infrastructure programs.\nSubsection (b) of this section authorizes a separate criteria\nfor the environmental infrastructure projects that are\nauthorized under section 219 of WRDA 1992 (106 Stat. 4835; 113\nStat. 335).\nSec. 1021. Aging infrastructure\nThis section authorizes the Secretary to enter into\ncontracts with federal agencies and non-federal entities that\nown, operate, and maintain a water resources, water storage, or\nirrigation project for enhanced inspections of aging\ninfrastructure. A non-federal entity that enters into such a\ncontract for such inspections cannot be required to complete\nany recommended actions resulting from the enhanced inspections\nunless the Secretary determines that failure to do so would\nconstitute a public safety risk.\nThe Committee believes that aging infrastructure continues\nto be a problem in the United States. In 2019, a 102-year-old\nirrigation tunnel collapsed near Fort Laramie, Wyoming, causing\na disruption of water supply to over 100,000 acres of land\nnecessary for the livelihoods of both farmers and ranchers in\neastern Wyoming and western Nebraska. This resulted in an\nestimated $100 million in economic damages. This Committee\nbelieves that measures, such as enhanced inspections of aging\ninfrastructure may help avoid similar future occurrences.\nSimilarly, enhanced inspections at aging water infrastructure\nprojects such as the Waterbury Dam, located in Waterbury,\nVermont, may better detect and monitor seepage and settlement.\nEnhanced inspections are likely to be an important tool for\nsafety inspections conducted by the Corps as part of its\nInspection of Completed Works Program.\nSec. 1022. Expediting repairs and recovery from flooding\nThis section requires that, for the five-year period\nbeginning with the enactment of this Act, the Secretary\nprioritize and expedite the processing of applications for\npermits under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (30 Stat.\n1151, chapter 425; 33 U.S.C. 403), section 404 of the CWA (33\nU.S.C. 1344), and permissions under section 14 of the Act of\nMarch 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1152, chapter 425; 33 U.S.C. 408). This\nincludes completions of repairs, reconstruction (including\nimprovements), and upgrades to flood control infrastructure\ndamaged by flooding events during calendar years 2017 through\n2020, including damage caused by ice jams.\nSec. 1023. Upper Snake River levees\nThis section requires the Secretary to prioritize and\nexpedite, in coordination with state, tribal and local\nauthorities, the completion of maintenance and repair\nactivities to levee systems that are both operated and\nmaintained by the Secretary and are in the Upper Snake River\nBasin.\nSec. 1024. Uniformity of notification systems\nThis section requires that the Secretary conduct an\ninventory of all communication and notification systems used by\nthe Corps with respect to projects, initiatives, and facilities\nof the Corps within 180 days of enactment of this Act. Further,\nwithin a year of enactment of this Act, the Secretary must\ndevelop a plan for making such communication and notification\nsystems uniform. Within 18 months, the Secretary shall\nimplement emergency management notifications. Within two years,\nthe Secretary must have completed implementation of the\ncommunication and notification uniformity plans.\nNothing in this section authorizes the elimination of any\nexisting communication or notification system used by the\nCorps.\nSec. 1025. Susquehanna, Delaware, and Potomac River Basin commissions\nThis section amends section 5019 of WRDA 2007 (121 Stat.\n1201; 128 Stat. 1307) to reauthorize the Susquehanna, Delaware,\nand Potomac River Basin Commissions, and transfers them under\nthe purview of EPA.\nSec. 1026. Wilmington Harbor South Disposal Area, Delaware\nThis section establishes the sediment fill height limit at\nthe Wilmington Harbor South Disposal Area confined disposal\nfacility, Delaware, at not more than 45 feet. Further, it\nspecifies that when the sediment fill reaches 45 feet, the\nSecretary must convey non-usable land at the facility for fair\nmarket value to the State of Delaware. Until that conveyance,\nthe facility may be used as a dredge disposal facility for the\nPort of Edgemoor and for other uses, as determined by the State\nof Delaware. The remaining capacity in the Wilmington South\ndisposal area would be utilized for the Corps\' maintenance of\nWilmington Harbor, which is the site\'s current purpose.\nSec. 1027. Conveyance of Wilmington Harbor North Disposal Area,\nDelaware\nThis section requires the ongoing conveyance by the\nSecretary of the Wilmington Harbor North Disposal Area confined\ndisposal facility, Delaware, to the State of Delaware to be\ncompleted as soon as practicable.\nSec. 1028. Coastal storm damage reduction contracts\nThis section requires the Secretary to seek input from the\ncommunity or communities where a coastal storm damage reduction\nproject is located to minimize, to the maximum extent\npracticable, the impact to the local economy due to the timing\nof the project activities.\nSec. 1029. Corps flood policy within urban areas\nThis section requires the Secretary to expedite the\ncompletion of the report on Corps flood policy within urban\nareas pursuant to section 1211 of AWIA 2018 (132 Stat. 3808).\nSec. 1030. Reporting on over budget and behind schedule Corps projects\nThis section requires the Secretary to submit a report\ndescribing water resources projects that either exceed the\ntotal estimated project budget by more than $100 million, or\nexceed the estimated project completion date by more than five\nyears. The report must be completed within 180 days of\nenactment of this Act and submitted to the Committee on\nEnvironment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on\nTransportation and Infrastructure of the House of\nRepresentatives.\nSec. 1031. Dam remediation for ecosystem restoration\nThis section amends section 542(b)(2) of WRDA 2000 (114\nStat. 2671; 121 Stat. 1150) to allow for dam remediation in the\nLake Champlain Watershed if the purpose is to restore, protect\nand preserve the surrounding ecosystem. This section applies to\ndams that have been constructed, in whole or in part, by the\nCorps for flood control purposes, for which construction was\ncompleted before 1940, that are classified as having ``high\nhazard potential\'\' by the state dam safety agency of the state\nin which the dam is located, and that are operated by a non-\nfederal entity as a critical restoration project.\nSec. 1032.

Acceptance of funds for harbor dredging\nThis section allows the Secretary to accept and expend\nfunds contributed by a state or other non-federal interest to\ndredge a non-federal harbor or channel or to provide technical\nassistance related to the planning and design of dredging\nactivities in a non-federal harbor or channel.\nSec. 1046. Emergency flooding protection for lakes\nThis section requires the Secretary to submit a report to\nCongress on the extent to which the program authorized under\nsection 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1941 (55 Stat. 650,\nchapter 377; 33 U.S.C. 701n), applies to lakes, including lakes\nwith the flow of a slow-moving river, including, if applicable,\nrecommendations for legislative changes to ensure that such\nlakes are eligible for the program.\nSec. 1047. Levee safety\nThis section amends section 9004 of WRDA 2007 (33 U.S.C.\n3303) to require the Secretary to identify engineering and\nmaintenance deficiencies, as well as describe recommended\nremedies and associated costs, for each levee identified in the\nnational levee database. When identifying deficiencies and\ndescribing remedies, the Secretary is required to consult with\nrelevant non-federal interests and provide them with an\nopportunity to comment.\nSec. 1048. Replacement capacity\nThis section amends section 217(a) of WRDA 1996 (33 U.S.C.\n2326a(a)) and expands upon the authority to allow the Secretary\nto approve the use of federal dredge disposal facilities for\nnon-federal construction of navigation improvements pursuant to\nsection 204(f) of WRDA 1986 (33 U.S.C. 2232(f)). If the\nSecretary determines that replacement capacity is necessary for\nfederal project purposes and can be constructed at an\nalternative dredge disposal facility, the non-federal interest\nshall be responsible for the costs to construct the replacement\ncapacity, but not until the capacity is needed for federal\nproject purposes. Additional costs or credits may be\nattributable to the non-federal interest depending on the\nproposed site for the replacement capacity of the dredge\nmaterial. This section also stipulates that the Secretary may\nnot reject a replacement capacity location unless it is\ndetermined that the site is environmentally unacceptable or\ntechnically unsound.\nSec. 1049. Implementation guidance for post-flood improvements\nThis section requires the Secretary to expedite the\nimplementation guidance for the amendments made by section 1176\nof WIIN 2016 (130 Stat. 1673).\nSec. 1050.

This reallocation is to ensure fish and wildlife\nbenefits, as required by the biological opinion for the\nWillamette Basin Review issued by the National Marine Fisheries\nService on June 28, 2019.\nThis section authorizes $2 million to remain available\nuntil expended.\nSec. 1051. Central Appalachia water\nThis section establishes a program under the Corps to\nprovide environmental assistance to non-federal interests in\nCentral and North Central Appalachia. This assistance is to be\nin the form of design and construction assistance for water-\nrelated environmental infrastructure and resource protection\nand development projects. This includes projects for publicly\nowned wastewater treatment and related facilities, water supply\nand related facilities, and surface water resource protection\nand development.\nThis section also requires that the Secretary enter into\nlocal cooperation agreements with non-federal interests and\ncreate a development plan with the appropriate federal and\nstate officials.\nThis section sets the federal cost-share of a project\ncarried out with the assistance under this section at 75\npercent. However, the non-federal interests may receive credit\nfor the reasonable costs of design work completed by the non-\nfederal interest before entering into a local cooperation\nagreement with the Secretary for a project, not to exceed 25\npercent of the total cost of the project.\nThis section authorizes $120 million, to remain available\nuntil expended.\nSec. 1052. Reviewing hydropower at Corps of Engineers facilities\nThis section amends section 1008 of WRRDA 2014 (33 U.S.C.\n2321b). It requires the Secretary, at the written request of an\neligible non-federal interest, to evaluate operational changes\nat the applicable project to facilitate production of non-\nfederal hydropower, consistent with authorized project\npurposes. Within 180 days of such a request, the Secretary must\nprovide a written response approving the request or specifying\nnecessary additional information. The non-federal cost-share\nassociated with an evaluation is 100 percent, including costs\nto prepare the report called for in this section.\nThis section also requires that an evaluation on the\neffects of the operational changes proposed by the non-federal\ninterest be complete within one year of its commencement. The\nSecretary must submit a report to the Committee on Environment\nand Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on\nTransportation and Infrastructure of the House of\nRepresentatives on the effects of the operational changes\nproposed by the non-federal interest. The Corps must examine\nthe effect of the changes on the authorized purposes of the\nproject, and describe any negative impacts of the proposed\noperational changes thereon.\nSec. 1053. Establishing permanent features from emergency response\nmeasures\nThis section requires the Secretary, at the request of an\nimpacted community, to evaluate whether a temporary structure\nthat was constructed by the Corps in response to a natural\ndisaster should become a permanent feature. In making that\ndetermination, the Secretary shall consider the likelihood that\na similar structure will need to be constructed in that area in\nthe future if not made permanent; the extent to which similar\nstructures have been constructed in the area previously and\nhave been removed; the economic, safety, and environmental\nbenefits and impacts of establishing a permanent feature in the\nwatershed of the impacted community; the extent of the\nmodifications necessary to make the temporary structure a\npermanent feature; and the costs of the modifications.\nOnce this evaluation is completed, the planning, design and\nconstruction of permanent features may proceed if the total\nproject cost is not expected to exceed $17.5 million. If the\ntotal construction cost of a project is more, then the\nSecretary must submit to Congress a request to carry out the\nproject in a manner similar to a Chief\'s Report and may not\ncarry out the project until Congress authorizes the\nconstruction of the project.\nThis section establishes the maximum non-federal cost-share\nfor carrying out a project under this section at 35 percent,\nexcept when carrying out a project with a small or\ndisadvantaged community if it is determined that the life,\nsafety, or economic viability of the community would be\nthreatened without the project. If that is determined to be the\ncase, the Secretary may reduce the cost-share of the applicable\nproject from a minimum of ten percent, up to 100 percent of the\nnon-federal share.\nAs is current law, the Committee directs the Secretary when\nimplementing this section to consider the current and future\nimpacts that any constructed feature might have on potential\nflooding upstream, on adjacent lands and interests, or on\ndownstream areas.\nSec. 1054. Studies of water resources development projects by non-\nFederal interests\nThis section amends section 203 of WRDA 1986 (33 U.S.C.\n2231) to permit a non-federal interest to undertake not just a\nfederally authorized feasibility study of a proposed project,\nbut also conduct a feasibility study on modifications or\nimprovements to a project constructed by the Corps.\nThis section mandates that the Secretary issue guidelines\nfor feasibility studies of water resources development projects\nconducted by non-federal interests to provide sufficient\ninformation for the formulation of the studies, including\nprocesses and procedures related to reviews and assistance. Any\ntechnical assistance provided by the Secretary under section\n2231 of WRDA 1986 may include assistance that does not conflict\nwith any other federal law, including regulations.\nSec. 1055.

Under the bill, any\nbudgetary impacts would be recorded on an accrual basis if the\nborrower is a nonfederal entity and would be repaying the\nobligation with nonfederal funds. This provision would allow\nthe costs or savings for loans to federal projects that meet\nthose two criteria to be recorded on an accrual basis. That\nbudgetary treatment is not allowed for federal projects under\ncurrent law.\nGeneral provisions of current law (often called the\nrecording statute) require the federal budget to be presented\non a cash basis--that is, the full cost of an activity is to be\nrecorded at the time an obligation is made.\\2\\ The Federal\nCredit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA), however, generally requires\nthe costs of direct loans and loan guarantees to nonfederal\nborrowers to be recorded on an accrual basis, and CBO estimates\nmost such costs on the basis of the net present value of the\ncash flows from those loans or loan guarantees.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\2\\The principal difference between cash and accrual accounting\nconcerns the time at which a commitment (or collection) of budgetary\nresources is recognized. Transactions in cash-based accounting are\nrecorded at the time payments are made or receipts are collected. By\ncontrast, accrual measures use a single number, the net present value,\nto express a flow of past and future income (or payments) in terms of\nan equivalent lump sum received (or paid) at a specific time. The\npresent value depends on the rate of interest (the discount rate) that\nis used to translate future cash flows into current dollars. For a\ndiscussion, see Congressional Budget Office, Cash and Accrual Measures\nin Federal Budgeting (January 2018), www.cbo.gov/publication/53461.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHowever, the status of a borrower as a nonfederal entity\nrepaying a loan with nonfederal funds is not a sufficient basis\nfor the loan or loan guarantee to receive FCRA treatment under\ncurrent law.\\3\\ In directing this budgetary treatment under S.\n3591, EPA could make loans and loan guarantees for federal\nprojects or assets and record the costs on an accrual basis--\nwhich would be reflected in a subsidy cost--rather than on a\ncash basis, thus understating the initial funding required for\nthose commitments.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\3\\See Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act Program\n(WIFIA) Criteria Pursuant to the Further Consolidated Appropriations\nAct, 2020, 85 Fed. Reg. 39189 (June 30, 2020), https://go.usa.gov/\nxf6mn.\n\\4\\The subsidy cost is the estimated lifetime cost to the\ngovernment, as measured by discounting all expected future cash flows\nassociated with the loan or loan guarantee to a net present value.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe subsidy costs of loans and loan guarantees for the\nWIFIA program are funded through annual appropriations. In\ndirecting a different budgetary treatment for certain WIFIA\nloans, the bill would cause future loans or loan guarantees to\nbe recorded in the budget at a lower cost than is required\nunder the recording statute, FCRA, and current practice. CBO\nbelieves that the difference between the costs on a cash basis\nand on an accrual basis should be recorded as an increase in\ndirect spending.\nUsing information about projects whose sponsors have\npreviously applied for WIFIA loans and the costs of current\nfederal projects with nonfederal components, CBO estimates that\nimplementing the provision would allow, on average, one federal\nproject annually, with an average loan size of $150 million, to\nreceive a WIFIA loan, which would be recorded on an accrual\nrather than cash basis.\\5\\ CBO also estimates that balances\navailable for the subsidy costs of WIFIA loans and loan\nguarantees that could be used for projects covered under S.\n3591 would be recorded on an accrual basis as well, increasing\nthe upfront costs of those commitments by $75 million. In\ntotal, CBO estimates, enacting that provision would increase\ndirect spending by $929 million over the 2021-2030 period.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\5\\The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, provided\nsubsidy budget authority for the WIFIA loan program but required EPA to\ndevelop criteria to determine project eligibility and apply those\ncriteria for projects selected in the 2020 cohort. CBO estimates that\nthose criteria would effectively prohibit EPA from selecting projects\nfor WIFIA loans that would receive accrual treatment under S. 3591 but\ncash treatment under current law. CBO expects those criteria to remain\nin place through fiscal year 2021. As a result, CBO estimates that the\nprovision would have no effect on direct spending for funds provided in\nthat fiscal year.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLoss of Nonfederal Payments for Army Corps of Engineers\nProjects: S. 3591 would authorize the Corps, at the request of\na project\'s nonfederal sponsor, to renegotiate the terms of\ndeferred-payment agreements that meet certain criteria. The\nbill would allow the nonfederal sponsor to discontinue payments\nat the time of the request until the sponsor and the Corps\nreach new terms; the bill provides no limit on the length of\nthose negotiations.\nAlthough the Corps generally requires nonfederal sponsors\nto pay their share of a project\'s costs while construction\nproceeds, the agency is authorized to enter into deferred-\npayment agreements that allow a nonfederal sponsor to defer\npayment for its share of the costs until the project is\ncompleted. Under such agreements, sponsors would pay the\nnonfederal share of the project\'s costs and any interest\naccrued during construction, with interest, over a term of up\nto 30 years. In such instances, the Corps uses appropriated\nfunds to pay 100 percent of a project\'s costs as they are\nincurred. For example, after Hurricane Katrina, the Corps\nentered deferred-payment arrangements with nonfederal sponsors\nfor projects to protect against storm surges and mitigate\nfuture risks of flooding.\\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\6\\Nearly 30 other Corps projects to mitigate similar damage in\nareas affected by hurricanes, including Sandy, Harvey, and Maria, are\neligible for deferred-payment agreements under current law. Nonfederal\nsponsors of some of those projects could enter such agreements and\ncould benefit from provisions under the bill. However, because those\nprojects are expected to take many years to complete, and because the\neligibility to renegotiate agreements under the bill requires a project\nto be delayed by at least five years, CBO expects that the budgetary\neffects of renegotiating those agreements would occur after 2030.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUnder the bill, projects with deferred-payment agreements\ncould be renegotiated if they started on or after September 8,\n2005, and if construction was delayed by five years after the\nexpected completion date established by agreement between the\nnonfederal sponsors and the Corps. At least three projects\ncould be eligible for renegotiation in the next several years.\nInformation from the Corps indicates that amounts outstanding\nfor those projects total $2 billion--$1.4 billion for the\nnonfederal share of the projects\' costs and $0.6 billion in\ninterest accrued during construction.\nUnder current law, annual payments for those projects total\nabout $114 million. For one possible outcome under the\nprovision, CBO assumes that the Corps agrees to renegotiate,\nthat the negotiations would take three years, and that the\ninterest accrued during construction would be waived under the\nnew agreements. The resulting annual payments under the new\nagreements for the principal balance alone would be $82\nmillion, CBO estimates, and would start in the fourth year\nafter enactment. That outcome would reduce offsetting receipts,\nwhich are recorded in the budget as reductions in direct\nspending, by about $570 million over 10 years. That total is\nderived from a reduction in offsetting receipts of $342 million\nduring the years of negotiations ($114 million annually for\nthree years) because payments would be suspended, and about $32\nmillion annually thereafter (the difference of $114 million and\nthe new payment of $82 million).\nA different outcome is possible under the deferred-payment\nprovision, however, because explicit completion dates are not\nprovided in the project partnership agreements. On that basis,\nthe Corps could determine that no project would be eligible\nbecause a delay, as defined by the bill, could not be\nestablished and therefore the agency would not renegotiate any\nagreements and there would be no loss of receipts.\nFor this estimate, CBO assumes that those two outcomes are\nequally possible. After accounting for uncertainties about\nwhether the negotiations would occur, how long they would take,\nand how much of the outstanding obligations would be waived,\nCBO estimates that enacting S. 3591 would decrease offsetting\nreceipts, which are recorded as increases in direct spending,\nby $286 million over the 2021-2030 period. That amount assumes\nthat the two budgetary outcomes each have a probability of 50\npercent: zero under an outcome in which no project would be\neligible and $570 million if all projects are eligible. After\n2030, CBO estimates, additional decreases in offsetting\nreceipts from those agreements would total about $330 million.\nOther Corps Provisions: CBO estimates that enacting other\nprovisions of S. 3591 would decrease offsetting receipts by $14\nmillion (thus increasing direct spending) over the 2021-2030\nperiod. The bill would direct the Corps of Engineers to limit\ncharges for water storage at a hydropower lake in the Arkansas\nRiver Basin for contracts negotiated before the end of 2022;\nwaive amounts owed by a nonfederal sponsor for a harbor project\nin False Pass, Arkansas; and reduce prices charged to low-\nincome communities for water storage.\nRevenues: The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation\n(JCT) expects that some of the funds authorized to be\nappropriated under S. 3591 for grants to state revolving funds\nand for loans to eligible entities under the WIFIA program\nwould be used by state and local governments to leverage\nadditional funds. Those entities would issue tax-exempt bonds\nthat JCT estimates would reduce federal revenues by $717\nmillion over the 2021-2030 period, as shown in Table 1.\nSpending subject to appropriation: S. 3591 would authorize\nthe appropriation of $18.3 billion over the 2021-2030 period.\nAssuming appropriation of that amount, CBO estimates that the\nbill would cost $16.3 billion over the same period (see Table\n3).\nTABLE 3.--ESTIMATED INCREASES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION UNDER S. 3591\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy fiscal year, millions of dollars--\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2021     2022     2023     2024     2025     2026     2027     2028     2029     2030   2021-2025  2021-2030\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIncreases in Spending Subject to Appropriation\nEPA Programs:\nEstimated Authorization.............      602    3,179    2,837    3,323       65       4.        2        1        1        1     10,007     10,016\nEstimated Outlays...................       87      746    1,581    2,401    2,661    1,607      694      202       22        6      7,476     10,008\nArmy Corps of Engineers Water Resources\nInfrastructure:\nEstimated Authorization.............       20      295      447      537      543      611      504      496      473      527      1,841      4,453\nEstimated Outlays...................        4       64      167      280      363      435      466      467      451      449        878      3,146\nContinuing Authorities and Other\nPrograms:\nEstimated Authorization.............      338      372      393      397      291      266      220      224      220      224      1,792      2,945\nEstimated Outlays...................      100      204      266      295      294      279      239      216      205      199      1,159      2,297\nOther Projects and Studies:\nEstimated Authorization.............      212      161      130      122       82       29       30       25       61       62        706        914\nEstimated Outlays...................      101      140      119      109       94       67       45       36       49       49        563        809\nTotal:\nEstimated Authorization.........    1,172    4,008    3,807    4,379      982      911      757      746      755      814     14,347     18,329\nEstimated Outlays...............      292    1,154    2,133    3,085    3,412    2,387    1,445      922      727      703     10,076     16,261\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nComponents may not sum to totals because of rounding; EPA = Environmental Protection Agency.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Programs: S. 3591 would\nspecifically authorize the appropriation of about $10 billion\nover the 2021-2025 period to fund grant programs and\nadministrative activities at EPA. Assuming appropriation of\nthat amount plus amounts needed for other required activities,\nCBO estimates that implementing the provisions would cost $7.5\nbillion over the 2021-2025 period and about $2.5 billion after\n2025.\nGrants. S. 3591 would authorize appropriations for 18 grant\nprograms to fund a variety of clean-water infrastructure\nprojects. The bill would extend or increase the authorizations\nfor 6 existing grant programs and direct EPA to implement 12\nnew programs. In total, S. 3591 would authorize about $9\nbillion in appropriations over the 2021-2025 period:\n$7.5 billion for grants to states through\nthe Clean Water State Revolving Fund program;\n$1 billion for grants to states to support\nmunicipal stormwater projects, alternative water source\nprojects, innovative stormwater control projects, and\nwastewater efficiency projects;\n$455 million for grants to support research\non preventing and reducing pollution; for nonprofit\nentities to provide technical assistance to publicly\nowned small, rural, or tribal water treatment works;\nfor nonprofit entities and publicly owned treatment\nworks to help connect certain households to publicly\nowned water treatment works; and for pilot programs in\nworkforce training for the water treatment industry;\nand\n$150 million for competitive grants for\nwastewater infrastructure projects.\nUsing information from EPA and historical information on\nspending for similar programs, CBO estimates that implementing\nthose provisions would cost about $6.6 billion over the 2021-\n2025 period and about $2.4 billion after 2025.\nOther Specified Authorizations. S. 3591 also would\nauthorize appropriations for other EPA programs totaling $948\nmillion over the 2021-2025 period:\n$625 million for programs to protect and\nrestore the Great Lakes and Puget Sound;\n$165 million for the subsidy costs of loans\nunder EPA\'s WIFIA program; and\n$158 million for program offices at Lake\nTahoe and San Francisco, EPA\'s National Estuary\nProgram, and to support responses to aquatic invasive\nspecies.\nUsing information from EPA and historical information on\nspending, CBO estimates that implementing those provisions\nwould cost $807 million over the 2021-2025 period and $133\nmillion after 2025.\nOther Costs. In addition, EPA would incur administrative\ncosts to establish and operate some of the programs authorized\nunder S. 3591 because generally the agency is not authorized to\ncover those costs using grant funds. Using information from EPA\nabout similar programs, CBO estimates that the agency would\nrequire about 20 additional employees, at a cost of $180,000\neach, to develop and administer the programs. CBO estimates\nthat the total cost would be about $16 million over the 2021-\n2025 period and $6 million after 2025.\nS. 3591 would require EPA to conduct various analyses and\nissue reports and to establish an interagency working group on\nwater reuse. It also would expand the duties of EPA\'s municipal\nombudsman. CBO estimates that implementing those provisions\nwould cost $5 million over the 2021-2025 period and $4 million\nafter 2025.\nArmy Corps of Engineers Water Resources Infrastructure:\nAfter accounting for anticipated inflation, CBO estimates that\nimplementing provisions of the bill that would authorize the\nCorps to construct 29 new water infrastructure projects would\ncost about $3.1 billion over the 2021-2030 period. Those\nprovisions would authorize the Corps to construct projects\naimed at restoring aquatic ecosystems, mitigating hurricane and\nstorm damage, strengthening flood risk management, and\nimproving the nation\'s navigation system.\nUsing information from the Corps, CBO estimates that the\ntotal cost to complete those projects would be $7.9 billion;\nthe federal share of those costs would total $5.1 billion and\nnonfederal entities would be responsible for the remaining $2.8\nbillion. About 60 percent of those amounts would be spent over\nthe 2021-2030 period and the rest would be spent after 2030.\nThe estimated cost of four projects authorized by the bill\ntotal $3.9 billion, which is 50 percent of the total for\nauthorized projects:\n$1.4 billion to mitigate flood risk in\nNorfolk, Virginia, by constructing storm surge\nbarriers, oyster reefs, and other natural barriers to\nreduce beach erosion and provide protection from\nhurricanes;\n$880 million to improve commercial\nnavigation by widening and deepening portions of the\nHouston, Texas, ship channel;\n$860 million to restore ecosystems in the\nMississippi River Basin to control upstream transfer of\nAsian carp and other aquatic nuisance species into the\nGreat Lakes and the Chicago Area Waterway System in\nIllinois; and\n$740 million to restore freshwater\necosystems and wetlands within the Loxahatchee River\nWatershed in Florida to improve water supply and\nprovide flood protection.\nTo estimate the pace of spending of funds authorized for\nthose projects, CBO used information from the Corps about\nprojects\' starting dates and expected duration and the amounts\nnecessary to complete projects within the anticipated\nschedules. CBO also analyzed the historical patterns of\nspending on similar projects. Because of their size and\ncomplexity, some large Corps projects can take several years to\nbegin and more than a decade to complete. CBO estimates that\nthe federal share of the projects authorized by this title\nwould require appropriation of about $4.5 billion over the\n2021-2030 period; the remainder of the federal share would be\nneeded after 2030.\nContinuing Authorities and Other Programs: S. 3591 would\nauthorize the appropriation of $2.9 billion for the Corps to\ncarry out continuing authorities and other programs. Under the\nCorps\' continuing authorities, certain types of water resources\nprojects can be implemented without explicit Congressional\nauthorization if they are limited in cost, size, and scope.\nSome authorizations would be annual, some would be annual\nincreases above existing authorization amounts, and some would\nbe onetime authorizations to be spent over several years. CBO\nestimates that implementing those authorities and programs\nwould cost about $2.3 billion in total over the 2021-2030\nperiod:\n$1.3 billion ($130 million annually) to\nstudy, construct, or enlarge water storage projects in\nrural communities with populations of less than 1\nmillion;\n$576 million for continuing authorities to\nconstruct projects for flood control; to improve\nnavigation; to protect aquatic habitats, wetlands, and\nproperty from storm damage; to mitigate environmental\ndamage from Corps projects; and to control shoreline\nerosion and restore beaches;\n$435 million for programs to operate\nwatercraft inspection stations between the United\nStates and Canada and to form partnerships with local\nstakeholders to develop plans and implement projects to\ncontrol and eradicate aquatic invasive species;\n$225 million for nonfederal partners to\nconduct feasibility studies and construct projects, to\nmitigate risks from flood and storm surges, improve\nharbor and inland navigation, and restore ecosystems;\n$190 million to construct surface-water\nprotection projects in rural areas, to plan and\nconstruct projects to rehabilitate fish and wildlife\nhabitat in the Rio Grande Basin, to construct\nrestoration projects in the Chesapeake Bay region, and\nto extinguish flowage easements held by the Corps at\nRough River Lake, Kentucky;\n$150 million to rehabilitate flood control\npumping stations that operate in conjunction with Corps\nprojects and to construct projects to mitigate the risk\nof impairment to a federal lock or dam from sediment,\nrock formation, or shallow water; and\n$70 million to complete reports authorized\nby the Congress and to conduct inspections for aging\nwater infrastructure projects owned or operated by a\nfederal agency.\nOther Projects and Studies: S. 3591 would authorize\nfeasibility studies, research projects and reports. The\nlegislation also would extend the authority for the Bureau of\nIndian Affairs to maintain Indian irrigation projects and\nauthorize the Corps to implement other projects. CBO estimates\nthat implementing this set of provisions would cost about $809\nmillion over the 2021-2030 period:\n$171 million to complete modification\nreports for environmental infrastructure projects and\nassist nonfederal partners to construct projects\nincluding those in Desoto and Jackson Counties in\nMississippi and Madison and St. Claire Counties in\nIllinois and in South Central Pennsylvania; Sacramento,\nCalifornia; and Lakes Marion and Moultrie, South\nCarolina;\n$153 million for comprehensive studies on\nmitigating flood risks in the Upper and Lower Missouri\nRiver, mitigating risks from hurricanes and storms\nalong the Mississippi River, assessing the effects on\nflooding and navigation of changing the form of the\nLower Missouri River, and addressing shoreline\nprotection and resiliency in the Great Lakes;\n$135 million to repair an embankment in\nWaco, Texas; support water resources research; and\nmaintain a high-risk dam on Lowell Creek in Seward,\nAlaska;\n$133 million to develop strategies to\ncontrol noxious weeds on federal land controlled by the\nCorps and to eliminate Asian carp in the Mississippi\nRiver; to construct projects in the Great Lakes and\nLake Okeechobee, Florida; to eliminate harmful algal\nblooms; to provide technical assistance to improve\nwater quality affected by abandoned mines; and to\nrelocate access to a confined disposal facility in the\nGreat Lakes region;\n$121 million for more than 40 feasibility\nstudies, reports, and evaluation of future projects and\nfor plans to manage sediment, improve subsurface\ndrainage systems, reallocate water supplies, and\nprevent the spread of aquatic invasive species;\n$84 million to coordinate with the\nAppalachian Regional Commission on design and\nconstruction of projects for securing water supplies,\ntreating wastewater, and developing surface water in\ncentral Appalachia;\n$71 million to extend the authority of the\nTreasury to deposit $35 million for each of the years\n2029 and 2030 into the Indian Irrigation Fund and to\nauthorize the appropriation of those amounts and\ninterest credited to the fund for maintaining Indian\nirrigation projects owned and operated by the Bureau of\nIndian Affairs; and\n$45 million to reauthorize the Denali\nCommission in Alaska to work with other federal\nagencies, Indian tribes, and state and local\ngovernments to support economic development and to\nmaintain Alaska\'s infrastructure, such as energy,\ntransportation, and health facilities.\nUncertainty: Although all of the estimated budgetary\neffects of this bill are subject to uncertainty, the estimates\nof two provisions are particularly uncertain.\nWater Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act: The number\nof loans and amount of those loans provided under WIFIA to\nsupport federal projects under S. 3591 could be higher or lower\nthan CBO estimates. If no loans were awarded for such projects\nor if the loan amounts were lower than CBO estimates, the\nestimated costs to implement the provision would be lower or\npossibly zero. By contrast, if WIFIA loans were awarded for\nmore federal projects or if the loan amounts were higher than\nCBO estimates, the costs of implementing the provision could be\nhundreds of millions of dollars above CBO\'s estimate.\nNonfederal Payments for Army Corps of Engineers Projects:\nWhether nonfederal sponsors would successfully renegotiate\npayment agreements under S. 3591, how much would be waived, and\nhow long the negotiations would take is uncertain. If the Corps\ndetermines that no project agreements meet the eligibility\ncriteria the estimated costs to implement the provision would\nbe zero. If nonfederal sponsors successfully renegotiate those\nagreements, if the amount waived is higher or lower than\nassumed, or if it takes more or less than three years as\nassumed, the costs could be higher or lower than CBO\'s\nestimate.\nPay-As-You-Go Considerations: The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go\nAct of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement\nprocedures for legislation affecting direct spending or\nrevenues. The net changes in outlays and revenues that are\nsubject to those pay-as-you-go procedures are shown in Table 4.\nTABLE 4.--CBO\'S ESTIMATE OF THE STATUTORY PAY-AS-YOU-GO EFFECTS OF S. 3591, THE AMERICA\'S WATER INFRASTRUCTURE ACT OF 2020, AS REPORTED BY THE SENATE\nCOMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS ON MAY 11, 2020\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy fiscal year, millions of dollars--\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2021     2022     2023     2024     2025     2026     2027     2028     2029     2030   2021-2025  2021-2030\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNet Increase in the Deficit\nPay-As-You-Go Effect....................       65       71       97      100      156      217      270      306      326      338        488      1,945\nMemorandum:\nChanges in Outlays..................       65       70       93       83      115      141      160      167      167      167        426      1,228\nChanges in Revenues.................        0       -1       -4      -16      -42      -76     -111     -139     -159     -171        -63       -717\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nComponents may not sum to totals because of rounding.\nIncrease in long-term deficits: CBO estimates that enacting\nS. 3591 would not increase on-budget deficits by more than $5\nbillion in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods\nbeginning in 2031.\nMandates: None.\nPrevious CBO estimates: Since October 2019, CBO has\ntransmitted six cost estimates for legislation containing\nprovisions that are similar to or identical to provisions in S.\n3591.

S. 3591\nwould limit the criteria used to determine the budgetary\ntreatment of the anticipated net cost or savings of loans or\nloan guarantees made under EPA's Water Infrastructure Finance\nand Innovation Act (WIFIA) program. Under the bill, any\nbudgetary impacts would be recorded on an accrual basis if the\nborrower is a nonfederal entity and would be repaying the\nobligation with nonfederal funds. This provision would allow\nthe costs or savings for loans to federal projects that meet\nthose two criteria to be recorded on an accrual basis. That\nbudgetary treatment is not allowed for federal projects under\ncurrent law.\nGeneral provisions of current law (often called the\nrecording statute) require the federal budget to be presented\non a cash basis--that is, the full cost of an activity is to be\nrecorded at the time an obligation is made.\\2\\ The Federal\nCredit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA), however, generally requires\nthe costs of direct loans and loan guarantees to nonfederal\nborrowers to be recorded on an accrual basis, and CBO estimates\nmost such costs on the basis of the net present value of the\ncash flows from those loans or loan guarantees.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\2\\The principal difference between cash and accrual accounting\nconcerns the time at which a commitment (or collection) of budgetary\nresources is recognized. Transactions in cash-based accounting are\nrecorded at the time payments are made or receipts are collected. By\ncontrast, accrual measures use a single number, the net present value,\nto express a flow of past and future income (or payments) in terms of\nan equivalent lump sum received (or paid) at a specific time. The\npresent value depends on the rate of interest (the discount rate) that\nis used to translate future cash flows into current dollars. For a\ndiscussion, see Congressional Budget Office, Cash and Accrual Measures\nin Federal Budgeting (January 2018), www.cbo.gov/publication/53461.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHowever, the status of a borrower as a nonfederal entity\nrepaying a loan with nonfederal funds is not a sufficient basis\nfor the loan or loan guarantee to receive FCRA treatment under\ncurrent law.\\3\\ In directing this budgetary treatment under S.\n3591, EPA could make loans and loan guarantees for federal\nprojects or assets and record the costs on an accrual basis--\nwhich would be reflected in a subsidy cost--rather than on a\ncash basis, thus understating the initial funding required for\nthose commitments.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\3\\See Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act Program\n(WIFIA) Criteria Pursuant to the Further Consolidated Appropriations\nAct, 2020, 85 Fed. Reg. 39189 (June 30, 2020), https://go.usa.gov/\nxf6mn.\n\\4\\The subsidy cost is the estimated lifetime cost to the\ngovernment, as measured by discounting all expected future cash flows\nassociated with the loan or loan guarantee to a net present value.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe subsidy costs of loans and loan guarantees for the\nWIFIA program are funded through annual appropriations. In\ndirecting a different budgetary treatment for certain WIFIA\nloans, the bill would cause future loans or loan guarantees to\nbe recorded in the budget at a lower cost than is required\nunder the recording statute, FCRA, and current practice. CBO\nbelieves that the difference between the costs on a cash basis\nand on an accrual basis should be recorded as an increase in\ndirect spending.\nUsing information about projects whose sponsors have\npreviously applied for WIFIA loans and the costs of current\nfederal projects with nonfederal components, CBO estimates that\nimplementing the provision would allow, on average, one federal\nproject annually, with an average loan size of $150 million, to\nreceive a WIFIA loan, which would be recorded on an accrual\nrather than cash basis.\\5\\ CBO also estimates that balances\navailable for the subsidy costs of WIFIA loans and loan\nguarantees that could be used for projects covered under S.\n3591 would be recorded on an accrual basis as well, increasing\nthe upfront costs of those commitments by $75 million. In\ntotal, CBO estimates, enacting that provision would increase\ndirect spending by $929 million over the 2021-2030 period.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\5\\The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, provided\nsubsidy budget authority for the WIFIA loan program but required EPA to\ndevelop criteria to determine project eligibility and apply those\ncriteria for projects selected in the 2020 cohort. CBO estimates that\nthose criteria would effectively prohibit EPA from selecting projects\nfor WIFIA loans that would receive accrual treatment under S. 3591 but\ncash treatment under current law. CBO expects those criteria to remain\nin place through fiscal year 2021. As a result, CBO estimates that the\nprovision would have no effect on direct spending for funds provided in\nthat fiscal year.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLoss of Nonfederal Payments for Army Corps of Engineers\nProjects. S. 3591 would authorize the Corps, at the request of\na project's nonfederal sponsor, to renegotiate the terms of\ndeferred-payment agreements that meet certain criteria. The\nbill would allow the nonfederal sponsor to discontinue payments\nat the time of the request until the sponsor and the Corps\nreach new terms; the bill provides no limit on the length of\nthose negotiations.\nAlthough the Corps generally requires nonfederal sponsors\nto pay their share of a project's costs while construction\nproceeds, the agency is authorized to enter into deferred-\npayment agreements that allow a nonfederal sponsor to defer\npayment for its share of the costs until the project is\ncompleted. Under such agreements, sponsors would pay the\nnonfederal share of the project's costs and any interest\naccrued during construction, with interest, over a term of up\nto 30 years. In such instances, the Corps uses appropriated\nfunds to pay 100 percent of a project's costs as they are\nincurred. For example, after Hurricane Katrina, the Corps\nentered deferred payment arrangements with nonfederal sponsors\nfor projects to protect against storm surges and mitigate\nfuture risks of flooding.\\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\6\\Nearly 30 other Corps projects to mitigate similar damage in\nareas affected by hurricanes, including Sandy, Harvey, and Maria, are\neligible for deferred-payment agreements under current law. Nonfederal\nsponsors of some of those projects could enter such agreements and\ncould benefit from provisions under the bill. However, because those\nprojects are expected to take many years to complete, and because the\neligibility to renegotiate agreements under the bill requires a project\nto be delayed by at least five years, CBO expects that the budgetary\neffects of renegotiating those agreements would occur after 2030.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUnder the bill, projects with deferred-payment agreements\ncould be renegotiated if they started on or after September 8,\n2005, and if construction was delayed by five years after the\nexpected completion date established by agreement between the\nnonfederal sponsors and the Corps. At least three projects\ncould be eligible for renegotiation in the next several years.\nInformation from the Corps indicates that amounts outstanding\nfor those projects total $2 billion--$1.4 billion for the\nnonfederal share of the projects' costs and $0.6 billion in\ninterest accrued during construction.\nUnder current law, annual payments for those projects total\nabout $114 million. For one possible outcome under the\nprovision, CBO assumes that the Corps agrees to renegotiate,\nthat the negotiations would take three years, and that the\ninterest accrued during construction would be waived under the\nnew agreements. The resulting annual payments under the new\nagreements for the principal balance alone would be $82\nmillion, CBO estimates, and would start in the fourth year\nafter enactment. That outcome would reduce offsetting receipts,\nwhich are recorded in the budget as reductions in direct\nspending, by about $570 million over 10 years. That total is\nderived from a reduction in offsetting receipts of $342 million\nduring the years of negotiations ($114 million annually for\nthree years) because payments would be suspended, and about $32\nmillion annually thereafter (the difference of $114 million and\nthe new payment of $82 million).\nA different outcome is possible under the deferred-payment\nprovision, however, because explicit completion dates are not\nprovided in the project partnership agreements. On that basis,\nthe Corps could determine that no project would be eligible\nbecause a delay, as defined by the bill, could not be\nestablished and therefore the agency would not renegotiate any\nagreements and there would be no loss of receipts.\nFor this estimate, CBO assumes that those two outcomes are\nequally possible. After accounting for uncertainties about\nwhether the negotiations would occur, how long they would take,\nand how much of the outstanding obligations would be waived,\nCBO estimates that enacting S. 3591 would decrease offsetting\nreceipts, which are recorded as increases in direct spending,\nby $286 million over the 2021-2030 period. That amount assumes\nthat the two budgetary outcomes each have a probability of 50\npercent: zero under an outcome in which no project would be\neligible and $570 million if all projects are eligible. After\n2030, CBO estimates, additional decreases in offsetting\nreceipts from those agreements would total about $330 million.\nOther Corps Provisions. CBO estimates that enacting other\nprovisions of S. 3591 would decrease offsetting receipts by $14\nmillion (thus increasing direct spending) over the 2021-2030\nperiod. The bill would direct the Corps of Engineers to limit\ncharges for water storage at a hydropower lake in the Arkansas\nRiver Basin for contracts negotiated before the end of 2022;\nwaive amounts owed by a nonfederal sponsor for a harbor project\nin False Pass, Arkansas; and reduce prices charged to low-\nincome communities for water storage.\nRevenues: The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation\n(JCT) expects that some of the funds authorized to be\nappropriated under S. 3591 for grants to state revolving funds\nand for loans to eligible entities under the WIFIA program\nwould be used by state and local governments to leverage\nadditional funds. Those entities would issue tax-exempt bonds\nthat JCT estimates would reduce federal revenues by $100\nmillion over the 2021-2030 period, as shown in Table 1. (Those\namounts have been revised; see discussion under the heading\n``Previous CBO Estimates.'')\nSpending Subject to Appropriation: S. 3591 would authorize\nthe appropriation of $18.3 billion over the 2021-2030 period.\nAssuming appropriation of that amount, CBO estimates that the\nbill would cost $16.3 billion over the same period (see Table\n3).\nTABLE 3.--ESTIMATED INCREASES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION UNDER S. 3591\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy fiscal year, millions of dollars--\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2021     2022     2023     2024     2025     2026     2027     2028     2029     2030   2021-2025  2021-2030\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIncreases in Spending Subject to Appropriation\nEPA Programs:\nEstimated Authorization.............      602    3,179    2,837    3,323       65        4        2        1        1        1     10,007     10,016\nEstimated Outlays...................       87      746    1,581    2,401    2,661    1,607      694      202       22        6      7,476     10,008\nArmy Corps of Engineers Water Resources\nInfrastructure:\nEstimated Authorization.............       20      295      447      537      543      611      504      496      473      527      1,841      4,453\nEstimated Outlays...................        4       64      167      280      363      435      466      467      451      449        878      3,146\nContinuing Authorities and Other\nPrograms:\nEstimated Authorization.............      338      372      393      397      291      266      220      224      220      224      1,792      2,945\nEstimated Outlays...................      100      204      266      295      294      279      239      216      205      199      1,159      2,297\nOther Projects and Studies:\nEstimated Authorization.............      212      161      130      122       82       29       30       25       61       62        706        914\nEstimated Outlays...................      101      140      119      109       94       67       45       36       49       49        563        809\nTotal:\nEstimated Authorization.........    1,172    4,008    3,807    4,379      982      911      757      746      755      814     14,347     18,329\nEstimated Outlays...............      292    1,154    2,133    3,085    3,412    2,387    1,445      922      727      703     10,076     16,261\n--------------------------------------------------
