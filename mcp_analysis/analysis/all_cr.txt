Mr. President, all across our Nation, the past few \ndays have seemed to mark a turn for the better.\n  On Friday morning, new data showed that the economic fallout from \nthis pandemic may have bottomed out and begun to turn around weeks \nearlier than had been predicted. Instead of losing millions more jobs \nin the month of May, our Nation had already begun adding back millions \nof jobs. Lockdowns are easing, and businesses are reopening. The \ngreatest country in world history is coming back online, and our \ncitizens are getting their jobs back by the millions.\n  Now, there is no question our national comeback is just beginning. \nThe coronavirus is still with us. We have a long way to go to rebuild \nand recover from the historic layoffs of this spring, but already, even \nin these early days of our careful reopening, the American people are \ntrouncing the predictions and starting to come back strong.\n  What is more, this weekend saw millions of Americans, once again, \ntake to the streets and town squares to protest the deaths of George \nFloyd, Breonna Taylor, and other Black Americans at the hands of law \nenforcement. Yet, unlike what our Nation faced about a week ago, this \nweekend\'s demonstrations seemed to have been almost entirely peaceful--\nno more rampant looting, no more police precincts set on fire. By and \nlarge, there had been just peaceful protests in our great American \ntradition.\n  In my home State of Kentucky, in Louisville, just like around the \nNation, hundreds gathered to remember Breonna Taylor on what would have \nbeen her 27th birthday and to continue to call for answers. In \nLexington, a moment of silence was held at an historic former slave \nmarket. Then a group marched to police headquarters. Police officers, \nincluding the chief, came out and met them in civil discourse. And, \nwhile a lot of ink has been spilled recently about our big cities, we \ncannot miss that this moment is echoing throughout smalltown America as \nwell.\n  In Henderson, in western Kentucky, 200 people--protesters, law \nenforcement, and local leaders alike--gathered for an interfaith prayer \nvigil. In southeastern Kentucky, in Corbin, more than 100 gathered for \na peaceful demonstration that included a prayerful moment of silence. \nThe police officers keeping watch joined in. In Hazard, a town of about \n5,000 people in eastern Kentucky, citizens gathered for what they \ncalled a ``march of love.\'\' It was the same story in Benton, in \nDanville, in Morehead--all around the Commonwealth and all around the \ncountry. Our\n\n[[Page S2748]]\n\ncountry has remembered that peace and protest can and must coexist.\n  The vast majority of the men and women in law enforcement across our \ncountry are not evil, are not racist, do not wake up every morning \nlooking for violence. We are reminded of their bravery every time a \ncitizen needs to dial 9-1-1, and they rush toward danger. We were all \nreminded again this past weekend, as these professionals bravely kept \nwatch over demonstrations, including ones where they themselves had \nbeen called racist or evil or were denigrated in the worst ways because \nof their uniforms and their badges.\n  So, if peaceful protesters rightly do not want to be lumped in with a \nsubset of looters and rioters who seek destruction, then the vast \nmajority of brave police officers cannot be lumped in with the very \nworst examples of heinous behavior. It is that simple. But, instead, we \nare already seeing outlandish calls to defund the police or to abolish \nthe police take root within the leftwing leadership class. The \npresident of the City Council in Minneapolis has proclaimed she can \n``imagine a future without police.\'\' One of her fellow council members \nput it even more clearly: ``This council is going to dismantle this \npolice department.\'\'\n  To be clear as to what this effort is about, one of the local groups \ninforming this push in Minnesota has literally stated that arts \nprograms and mental health resources will be more effective at stopping \ncrime than will be armed cops. Instead of ``strangers armed with \nguns,\'\' they say other professionals like social workers should be the \nones to ``respond to crises in our community.\'\'\n  I am all for social work and mental health, but call me old-\nfashioned--I think you may actually want a police officer to stop a \ncriminal and arrest him before we try to work through his feelings.\n  Well, even if some leftwing leaders fall for this nonsense, I have a \nfeeling the American people are too smart for that. They know that what \nhappened to George Floyd was totally abhorrent. They also know that \nriots and looting are unacceptable. They also know that well-trained \nlaw enforcement officers are an important part of creating safe \ncommunities, not something to defund or abolish.\n  So I am proud that Americans across the country can protest in safety \nand peace. I am proud that their neighbors continue to answer the call \nto protect and to serve, and I am hopeful that, with unity and mutual \nrespect, we can continue this important national discussion to ensure \njustice and equal protection under the law\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>'

Mr. President, on an entirely different subject, while \nthe Senate remains the only Chamber in this Capitol with its lights on, \nwe are going to continue with legislative work for the country. We will \ntake our first vote today to advance the Great American Outdoors Act--a \ngenerational bill from Senator Daines and Senator Gardner--that will \nsecure the future of our Nation\'s natural treasures.\n  America is home to 419 national park sites, 567 national wildlife \nrefuges, and hundreds of millions of acres of public lands. Every year, \nmillions of Americans turn to these lands for recreation, inspiration, \nand for their livelihoods. These resources exist because of the \nvisionary actions of prior Congresses. Now it is our turn to secure \nthem for generations yet to come.\n  Our colleagues\' legislation does two big things: It improves access \nto parks and public lands by investing in maintenance and upkeep, and \nit secures permanent support for the missions of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  Their legislation has already persuaded 59 cosponsors here in the \nSenate. It has earned the bipartisan endorsement of the last six former \nSecretaries of the Interior, and a diverse coalition of independent \nadvocates--from The Nature Conservancy to the Outdoor Industry \nAssociation to the American Battlefield Trust--have called on us to \npass this bill.\n  This bill has unusually broad, bipartisan, and vocal support because \nthe issues at hand affect so many different communities so concretely. \nEvery year, visitors to America\'s national parks bring more than $40 \nbillion in economic impact to the gateway towns that surround them. The \nState and local parks, stewarded by the LWCF, help to generate another \n$166 billion in local economic activity and support more than 1.1 \nmillion jobs.\n  My fellow Kentuckians and I know this firsthand. At least 120,000 \njobs are supported by active outdoor recreation in the Commonwealth. \nFrom hunters and anglers in the Daniel Boone National Forest to \ntourists visiting Mammoth Cave, our State\'s natural treasures occasion \nnearly $13 billion in annual consumer spending. Yet Kentuckians also \nknow that tight budgets for maintenance often mean that historic sites \ngo without important repairs and upgrades that would ensure safe access \nand smooth operations. So we are acutely aware of the need to address \nthe deferred maintenance backlog, which this legislation tackles head-\non.\n  So I am very grateful to our colleagues from Montana and Colorado for \nshepherding this legislation. I am proud of the stand they have taken \nin support of our Nation\'s natural wonders and the millions of American \nlivelihoods that depend on them. I look forward to discussing this \nlandmark legislation more in the days ahead, to supporting it here on \nthe floor, and to urging every one of my colleagues to join in.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>'

The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                Protests\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, ``Equal Justice Under Law\'\'--those \nwords are etched in stone above the doors of the Supreme Court, a \nbedrock principle of the American system. These past few weeks have \nbeen a searing reminder of how that principle does not reflect the \nlived experience for many Americans.\n  For Black Americans, confrontations with the police are not the same \nas for White Americans. You can be standing on a street corner like \nEric Garner or asleep in your bed like Breonna Taylor and have your \nlife ended by police. George Floyd\'s brutal death at the hands of a \nWhite police officer in Minneapolis sparked peaceful protests across \nthis country because as singular and tragic as the death of George \nFloyd was, his experience was one that resonated with far too many \nBlack Americans.\n  That is why hundreds of thousands of Americans have engaged in \npeaceful demonstrations against police violence and systemic racism. \nFrom Los Angeles to Washington, DC, and from Seattle to New York City, \nwhere I joined shoulder to shoulder with my fellow New Yorkers on \nSaturday, Americans from all walks of life have marched, sang, prayed, \ncried, and spoken out that Black lives matter; that our country \npromises justice for all but too often only delivers it for some.\n\n[[Page S2749]]\n\n  The protests weren\'t confined to big cities. Thousands turned out in \nAllentown and Fayetteville, PA; in Fairmont, WV; and in Havre, MT. \nThere were Black Lives Matter protests in Vidor, TX, a city with a \ntroubled history as a haven for the KKK, and Harvard, NE, a city with \nonly 1,000 residents.\n  Remarkably, though these protests concerned events within our \nborders, they sparked outrage far outside of them. The name ``George \nFloyd\'\' was chanted in Rome, Paris, London, Amsterdam, Berlin, and \nMexico City. This is a rare moment for our Nation\'s history. Injustice \nstares us so plainly in the face that the great mass of our people are \ndemanding change. The institutions of our government and our democracy \nhave an obligation to answer.\n  Today, we are taking the first of many necessary steps to respond to \nour national pain with bold action. This morning, I joined with Speaker \nPelosi and several of our House colleagues, Representatives Bass, \nClyburn, Nadler, and Jeffries, as well as my colleagues, Senators \nBooker and Harris, to introduce the Justice in Policing Act--a response \nto the recent protests and the years of failure to reform our police \ndepartments.\n  The Justice in Policing Act proposes crucial reforms to combat racial \nbias and excessive force by law enforcement. It would ban the use of \nchoke holds and other tactics that have left Black Americans dead. It \nwould limit the transfer of military weaponry and equipment to police \ndepartments. It would change the legal standard to make it easier to \nhold police accountable for misconduct when they use deadly force on \nAmerican citizens.\n  Through increased data and transparency, as well as important \nmodifications to training and practices, it would help prevent police \nmisconduct in the first place. This has never been done before at the \nFederal level, and it would encourage the same changes at the State and \nlocal level in order for those police departments to receive Federal \nfunds.\n  In the Senate, Democrats are going to fight like hell to make this \nproposal a reality. Americans who took to the streets have demanded \nchange. With this legislation, Democrats are heeding their call. Now is \nthe time for Leader McConnell to commit to putting police reform on the \nfloor of the Senate before July 4 to be debated and voted on. Several \nRepublicans have acknowledged the egregious wrongs, but too few have \nexpressed a need for floor action. Too many have remained silent. Maybe \nour Republican friends are hoping the issue goes away. I promise them \nit will not. Democrats will not let this go away, and we will not rest \nuntil we achieve real reforms.\n  Leader McConnell, let\'s have the debate not just on TV and Twitter \nbut on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We need legislation and debate. A \ndivided nation cannot wait for healing and for solutions. The \nRepublican majority must not continue to squander the Senate\'s time on \nrightwing judges and conspiracy hearings. History will judge whether \nthis Chamber responds to the Nation\'s pain with action or lets an old \nand terrible wound in our society continue to fester.\n  The poison of racism affects more than our criminal justice system. \nIt runs much deeper than that. There are racial disparities in housing \nand healthcare, education and the economy, income and wealth, and COVID \nhas only placed a magnifying glass on all these forms of inequality.\n  There are now 118,000 confirmed deaths from COVID in the United \nStates. Black Americans have died at a disproportionate rate. As \nhospitals and healthcare workers have scrambled to secure enough \nsupplies and create enough space, those institutions that serve \ncommunities of color have been the most strained. As our medical crisis \nled to an economic crisis, it is largely African Americans and Latinos \nwho have seen their jobs disappear faster and more permanently.\n\n  The President is evidently prepared to declare the fight against \nCOVID-19 over because 15 percent of our country\'s citizens are \nunemployed, not 20 percent, even though that figure--15 percent--is \nhigher than at any point during the Great Recession. The reason \nunemployment isn\'t as shockingly awful as it might have been was that \nCongress leapt into action at the outset of the pandemic and passed a \nmajor bill, the CARES Act, to keep the country afloat. The bill that \neventually passed was bipartisan, but Democrats had to push Republicans \nalmost every step of the way to get many of the improvements in the \nbill. Much of the aid the bill gave to unemployment, to our healthcare \nsystems, and to truly small businesses was because Democrats insisted.\n  If the President and Senate Republicans declare victory too early, if \nthey lull into complacency now, and if they wait too long to pass \nanother round of emergency relief, the economic conditions in our \ncountry will deteriorate. If we do nothing, more Americans will lose \ntheir jobs, more Americans will lose their healthcare, more Americans \nwill struggle to put food on the table and keep a roof over their head, \nand more Americans will see small businesses they sweated so hard to \ncreate fail.\n  We fear that the recent bump in the employment number, caused in \nlarge part because of the stimulus money we pumped into the economy, \nwill create, in Republicans, a sense of complacency, and the economy \nwill get even worse.\n  The fact that we are confronted by so many challenges--so many \nchallenges--can seem overwhelming. The fact and the consequences of \nRepublican inaction, the fact that they fall so heavily on Black and \nBrown Americans is so confounding, but there is no reason that we \ncannot respond to this moment of national crisis with vigorous and \nsustained action, with purposeful action and bipartisan effort on the \nCOVID pandemic and long, simmering issues of police violence and racial \njustice. We must do both.\n  That is what the Senate, supposedly the world\'s greatest deliberative \nbody, was designed to do. There are four remaining weeks before July 4. \nThe time for waiting is gone. Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans \nmust commit to putting a police reform bill on the Senate floor for \ndebate and a vote. They must commit to working with us on another \nemergency relief package. We have waited too long already. Let me \nrepeat. Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans, we must accomplish two \nthings before July 4: police reform and COVID relief. We can and must \ndo both. Do not stand in the way of a nation yearning for solutions--\nnot for empty rhetoric, not for name-calling, and not for partisanship.\n  Before I yield the floor, I want to mention one other issue. Last \nweek, President Trump was responsible for ordering Federal officers to \nforce peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square--just across the street \nfrom the White House--in clear violation of their First Amendment \nrights of freedom of speech and assembly. It was deeply offensive and \nwrong. Even more appalling was the purpose of the order: to clear a \npath for the President to stage a political stunt at nearby St. John\'s \nChurch.\n  Today, Lafayette Square, a place which has long been a venue where \nAmericans gather to freely exercise their constitutional rights, \nremains blocked off by heavy fencing. The President has converted this \nunique public park in the heart of the Nation\'s Capital into something \nresembling a militarized zone. Lafayette Square should be a symbol of \nfreedom and openness to the world, not a place behind which the \nPresident cowers in fear of peaceful protesters crying out for justice.\n  So, moments ago, Speaker Pelosi and I sent a letter to President \nTrump urging him to reopen Lafayette Square. President Trump, tear down \nthese walls and allow the public to gather in front of the White House \nfor you and for all the world to hear their voices\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                               H.R. 1957\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Great American \nOutdoors Act that we may be debating this week. I am hoping that we can \nfind a responsible way to pay for the maintenance backlog of our \nnational parks.\n  Our national parks are an important source of pride for our country. \nThey are known internationally. We had the first national park in the \nworld with Yellowstone Park. Unfortunately, our parks are in the midst \nof a rising crisis\n\n[[Page S2750]]\n\nthat has been building over many years. They are in desperate need of \nrepair and maintenance and fixing them will require billions of \ndollars.\n  This week, the Senate is working on legislation to address this \nbacklog, and I believe it is vital that we address this issue both \nresponsibly and permanently. This will help generations to fix problems \nin our parks without having to put the cost on the Nation\'s credit \ncard. We can pay now or we can make our kids pay through reduced \nFederal help and services that we are used to, or we can figure out a \nway to have a small fee now. It should be a pretty easy choice.\n  Unfortunately, the Great American Outdoors Act, as written, \nrepresents only a one-time fix and is neither responsible nor \npermanent. Instead, the bill adds over $17 billion to our national \ndebt. Moreover, the measure includes a permanent reauthorization of the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund Program, which will add even more \nfuture maintenance to our already backlogged systems without being paid \nfor.\n  After all of the spending we have just undertaken, we must be more \nvigilant in finding proper ways to ensure our government spending is \npaid for, and fixing this bill can be an important place to start. \nWithout some changes, this legislation will force our country to borrow \nmore money, burying us deeper in debt, and only provide funding for 5 \nyears.\n  I am also concerned that the bill tries to spend the same money \ntwice, which is using a budget gimmick. We should always strive to be \nfiscally responsible, and that is even more important now after \nCongress has spent more than $2 trillion to respond to the coronavirus \npandemic. To address the current park\'s backlog, it would cost nearly \n$12 billion, according to the National Park Service. In comparison, \nlast year, the entire national budget for the national parks was $4.1 \nbillion. Let me repeat that. The cost would be $12 billion to take care \nof the backlog. Their whole budget last year was just $4.1 billion.\n  Congress is already struggling to find funding for other worthwhile \nFederal needs. That is why, for the past several years, I have worked \non a fix. I filed an amendment to this bill that addresses the \nmaintenance issues responsibly and permanently without adding to our \ndebt. Let me repeat that. My amendment is completely offset and \nprovides a permanent solution. It has been ignored, so far, through \nthis process.\n  The way my amendment works is by asking our foreign visitors, who \nnumbers show are increasingly enjoying our parks, to pay $16 or $25 \nmore when they enter the country as part of their visa fee--a part of \nit--not a big increase compared to that.\n  According to a study by the U.S. Travel Association, nearly 40 \npercent of the people who come to the United States from abroad are \nvisiting one or more of our national parks. That is over 14 million \npeople who come from abroad and visit our national parks.\n  It is great that people from all over the world recognize the value \nof these national treasures, but this increased visitation is adding to \nthe maintenance backlog, and it is only fair that we ask them to help \nmaintain these national treasures.\n  There is nothing novel about this concept. Anyone who has visited an \nattraction outside of the United States has probably encountered such \nfees in one way or another. For example, foreign visitors to the Taj \nMahal in India will pay an $18 fee, compared to a fee of only 56 cents \nfor local visitors. At Kruger National Park in South Africa, visitors \nfrom outside the country will pay $25 per day compared to $6.25 for \nlocal visitors.\n  Many European countries--like Spain, France, and Italy--charge a \ntourist tax on hotel rooms that is used to pay for tourism \ninfrastructure.\n  We also ask park visitors to assist with addressing the backlog. No \none likes to pay more for things, especially during times like these, \nbut to maintain these national treasures for future generations, we \neither borrow money and put it on the national credit card or we take \nsome modest steps to address the issue responsibly--kind of a pay-as-\nyou-go.\n  My amendment only raises entrance fees by $5 and annual passes by \n$20, so bringing a vehicle into the park would still be cheaper than \ntaking a family of four to a movie or visiting an amusement park for a \nday. In fact, it is a real bargain from that.\n  We, as a nation, have seen the joy our national parks bring to those \nwho venture and visit them. In Wyoming and all across the country, \nAmerica\'s national parks are something to be proud of and protect. We \nowe it to the parks and to the citizens and foreign visitors who \npartake of their wonders to keep them in good working order. We should \nnot allow the maintenance and repairs to fester, which erodes visitor \nexperiences and costs billions to fix.\n  Are people going to the parks? Yes, they are. Yellowstone National \nPark has opened up now and I think is at about 75 percent of capacity \nalready. I read in the papers about this family from Georgia who was \nplanning on taking their family to Florida to Disney World, but Disney \nWorld is closed, so they drove across the country to Wyoming and went \nto Yellowstone National Park. One of the adventures they got was to get \nto see a real wolf up close and personal. They got some good pictures \nof it too.\n  People will travel a long way to see these parks. They don\'t expect \nthem to be an international bargain, and neither do foreign visitors \nwho are used to seeing us, when we go to their country, pay a higher \nfee for national parks.\n  We need to fix our national parks. The question is, Will we pay as it \nis used or will we force our kids and grandkids to pay for something \nthey maybe never got to enjoy? We can put a small addition on foreign \nvisa fees or we can pass it on to our kids.\n  Let\'s do one amendment that will pay for parks in perpetuity, not \njust gimmick spending for 5 years. Fixing this bill will help ensure we \nno longer have to put our parks\' current obligations on the backs of \nfuture generations.\n  I know the item at stake here will not end our fiscal crisis, but if \nwe can\'t do something modest to start to address our spending \naddiction, then we are in greater trouble than I ever thought.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ernst). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                 Reform\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, over the last few months, America has \nexperienced a trifecta of crises, which are reminiscent of some of the \nmost difficult periods in our Nation\'s history. In many ways, it feels \nlike we are learning what it was like to live through the Spanish flu \npandemic, the Great Depression, and the civil rights movement--all at \nonce.\n  This period has challenged all of us physically, economically, and \nemotionally, and while we still have a long way to go, we are seeing \nincremental signs of progress. Last week, New York City--once the \nepicenter of COVID-19 cases--reported no confirmed coronavirus deaths. \nThat was the first time that had happened since March 11.\n  Our economy is experiencing positive improvement as well. Friday\'s \njobs report showed that employment rose by 2.5 million people in May--\nan absolutely astonishing and recordbreaking figure. I think that is \nthe first time that happened since 1934. Unemployment dropped to 13.3 \npercent. That is still way too high but a sharp contrast from the \nexpectations and projections of economists.\n  While we are seeing the needle move in the right direction in our \nfight to defeat the coronavirus and restore our economy, the third in \nthis trio of crises is much more complex. The murder of George Floyd \nhas sparked passion and anger throughout our country and galvanized \npeople of all skin colors, backgrounds, and ages to demand action. In \nbig cities and small towns alike, we have seen peaceful marches and \npowerful demonstrations calling for an end to racial injustice that has \nexisted sadly since our country\'s inception.\n  One of the largest protests in the country happened last week in Mr. \nFloyd\'s hometown in Houston, TX, where I was born and where he will be\n\n[[Page S2751]]\n\nburied tomorrow. An estimated 60,000 people gathered to march in his \nhonor and demand justice\n  The first step in justice for George Floyd, and now that all four \nofficers involved in his death have been arrested and charged, is for \nthe criminal justice system to work. But these four arrests do not \nerase the larger problems that exist in our society--the lack of trust, \nthe sense that justice is not equal. In fact, they have only shined a \nbrighter light on the systemic problems that we need to do our best to \ntry to address. Making lasting changes will not be quick or easy.\n  At the rally in Houston, several of Mr. Floyd\'s family members spoke, \nand one said: ``This is going to be more like a marathon.\'\' I think \nthat is pretty realistic. It is going to take some time, and it will be \nthe result of difficult discussions but necessary discussions that are \nhappening in homes, workplaces, and buildings like this all across the \ncountry.\n  No one has all the answers, but there is a lot we can learn--first, \nby simply listening to one another. Earlier today, I was able to speak \nto George Floyd\'s family and do just that--listen. They have gone \nthrough unimaginable pain over these last 2 weeks.\n  I told them I am committed to making sure that George Floyd receives \njustice. I said: In my experience during times like this, the best \ncomfort you can offer to someone who has lost a loved one is that their \ndeath will not be in vain; that something good will come out of it.\n  We know some of the most important reforms that need to be made are \nin our criminal justice system. The tragic events of Minneapolis, \nLouisville, and a number of other cities across the country have \nrenewed calls to transform policing practices and repair the divide \nthat exists between some communities and the police. Of course, much of \nthat will take place at the local and State level. It is, in fact, the \ncity council and mayors who hire the police chief and make sure they \nare running their programs and their departments with integrity and \nprofessionalism. That is where most of the important decisions about \nday-to-day policing and procedures are made.\n  One example in my State is the Sandra Bland Act, which Governor \nAbbott signed into law in 2017. The namesake of that bill was a Black \nwoman who was found dead in a county jail days after being arrested \nduring a routine traffic stop. The law passed in her honor made a \nnumber of changes, including requiring deescalation training for law \nenforcement officials, much like we have done in the mental health \nspace.\n  The individual police departments are the ones that make decisions \nabout specific practices, responsible, of course, to their city \nleadership, such as banning knee holds or choke holds. There are \nimportant conversations taking place across Texas and the country about \nhow we can effectively promote and improve police practices and begin \nto repair the damaged relationship between our minority communities and \nour police.\n  To strengthen that work, there are steps we can take in Washington, \nDC. I know many of us are engaged in active discussions about what is \nthe best way to create real change. I know it is a priority for Members \non both sides of the aisle.\n  One proposal I have mentioned is a bipartisan bill that I introduced \nwith Senator Gary Peters of Michigan and Chairman Lindsey Graham last \nyear. This bill actually had 20 bipartisan cosponsors. It was endorsed \nnot only by the Urban League and the NAACP but the major police \norganizations in this country as well. It passed unanimously in the \nSenate. Unfortunately, we ran out of time in the House so it did not \nactually become law--not yet.\n  This legislation creates a National Criminal Justice Commission, much \nlike the 9/11 Commission, that would review our criminal justice system \nwrit large from top to bottom--something that has not happened since \n1965. In 18 months, the Commission would report back to us and make \nrecommendations for changes that could be considered and passed by the \nCongress.\n  This would allow us to systemically look at what is working and what \nisn\'t and what needs to be done to modernize our criminal justice \nsystem, including repairing the broken relationship between law \nenforcement and some of our minority communities.\n  The review that took place in 1965 produced 1,200 specific \nrecommendations, and it is past time to once again take stock of the \nsuccesses and failures of our criminal justice system.\n  As I mentioned, the bill that passed the Senate unanimously had 20 \nbipartisan cosponsors and was supported by the National Association of \nPolice Organizations, Major City Chiefs Association, the National Urban \nLeague.\n  I believe this type of legislation would give us the basic framework \nfor the lasting changes that we are all after. It would be an umbrella \ncommission under which a lot of very specific and granular issues could \nbe debated and voted on and, if meritorious, passed and become part of \nthe law.\n  I hope it will become a part of our conversation that we are having \nin the coming days and weeks. Rooting out racial injustice that has \nexisted for generations will require a long-term, bipartisan commitment \nin Congress and in homes and institutions across the country.\n  I do believe it is simply wrong to paint all police and all law \nenforcement as somehow racially biased. I think that is not deserved, \nand I think it is just flat wrong and irresponsible. Clearly, when \nthere are cases of abuse, where even a police officer crosses the line, \nthey need to be held accountable, and we need to be focused on \nidentifying those individuals not only in prosecuting them but in \nsending a message that that sort of action will not be tolerated in a \ncivilized society. And next, we need to regain the confidence for all \nof our people or all colors; that the police are our friend and a \nnecessary part of our ordered liberty.\n  Without order, you have anarchy. Only with order, fair laws justly \nadministered on an equal basis can we enjoy the liberty that is part of \nour birthright in America. I am committed to being part of the \nsolution, and I am eager to roll up my sleeves with all of our \ncolleagues and get to work\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               H.R. 1957\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I am on the floor to talk about the \nhistoric opportunity that is before this body this evening and \nthroughout the week to be able to help us get our national parks back \non track. These are our treasured national parks that are such a great \nasset to our country, and right now they are in trouble.\n  One of the bills before us this week, in what is called the Great \nAmerican Outdoors Act, is the bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act. It \ndirects Federal funding from royalties on oil and gas leases and other \nenergy leases to Federal lands. It directs that funding to our national \nparks to take care of deferred maintenance.\n  Why is this investment needed? Thanks to the wisdom of Teddy \nRoosevelt, who had the foresight to set aside and preserve some of our \nmost spectacular land for public use, and thanks to so many friends of \nthe parks who have followed, America\'s national parks are without \nequal. The National Park Service and its system now comprise 84 million \nacres of land and historical sites that now attracts 330 million \nvisitors every year. In fact, from 2006 to 2017, annual visitation in \nour parks increased by about 58 million people. They are popular.\n  During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is clear there is a lot of demand to \nbe in the out-of-doors. And so I believe as we start to reopen our \nparks this summer, which we will do soon, Americans will be all the \nmore eager to go out to our parks and explore our country\'s natural \nbeauty and explore its history.\n  The problem is that when people head to the parks, they may be \nsurprised that things are a little rundown. This isn\'t new. It has been \nhappening to our parks for decades, actually. Some of the trails will \nbe closed. Some of the bathrooms aren\'t going to be working. In places, \nroads and bridges will be crumbling, and visitor centers that have \nleaks in their roofs will be\n\n[[Page S2752]]\n\nclosed. It is a widespread problem of deferred maintenance that has \ngradually grown to become a huge backlog of around $12 billion at our \nnational park sites. That is $12 billion in deferred maintenance that \nhas not been taken care of.\n  The good news is, with my colleagues Senator Warner, Senator \nAlexander, and Senator King, we introduced this commonsense solution a \nfew years ago called Restore our Parks Act. It will address this \nbacklog.\n  To me, this is a debt unpaid. It would have been a lot smarter to pay \nit all along, by the way, but our annual appropriations here in \nCongress were never big enough, so what funds we had available went for \nthings like park rangers, for programming, and, frankly, for applying \nbandaids to some of these maintenance problems.\n  Other funds also, of course, went to expanding our parks. Let me make \none thing clear: This bill before us today--the Restore Our Parks Act--\nis all about stewardship. It is about taking better care of what we \nhave. Not a penny of it can be used for expansion.\n  Of course, one of our challenges right now, as a country coming out \nof the coronavirus pandemic, is to figure out how to get people back to \nwork, and it is a real challenge because, although the jobs report on \nFriday was encouraging in terms of some jobs being added in May, we \nstill have one of the highest unemployment rates we have ever had in \nthis country.\n  One place we have an opportunity to get people back to work is, of \ncourse, rebuilding our infrastructure. There are lots of discussions \nabout that. Well, this legislation does that. These are shovel-ready \nprojects--infrastructure projects that are ready to go.\n  Last week, the National Parks Service released a new study that found \nthat the Restore Our Parks Act will support 100,000 new jobs as we \nrebuild our national parks infrastructure over the next 5 years--40,000 \ndirect jobs, about 60,000 indirect jobs--over 100,000 total new jobs.\n  By the way, these are good jobs. These are jobs with good pay and \ngood benefits.\n  I first became involved in this issue of our national parks because I \nhave grown to love the parks, as do so many Americans. Even those who \ndon\'t have a chance to visit them very much are proud of the fact that \nwe have this incredible system, this true treasure for our country.\n  When I was about 12 years old, my mom and dad took us to Yellowstone \nPark, and we went camping, and we saw the geysers, and we got to see \nthings that I had never seen before--just this spectacular park in the \nWest. This amazing park system that we have in this country continues \nto be something I am proud of. So ever since I was 12 years old, I have \nbeen a parks fan.\n  We have eight national parks in my home State of Ohio. One of those \nis called the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, which is our largest \nsingle park. It is actually the thirteenth most visited park in the \ncountry. You may not have heard of it, but it is an awesome park. It is \nkind of situated right in between Cleveland and Akron. It is a place \nwhere you can go biking; you can go hiking; you can go fishing; you can \ngo kayaking; you can take a scenic railway through the park. It is a \nspectacular place, and it is accessed by a lot of people, being so \nclose to the suburbs and even so close to the cities. It is not a \ntypical park out in the rural area; it is a park that is really right \nup against the suburbs and close to the cities. I am proud to be one of \nthe 2.7 million visitors a year that goes to Cuyahoga Valley National \nPark to take advantage of all those things I talked about.\n  In addition to these larger parks, our park system also includes a \nlot of other sites. As an Ohio example, in my hometown of Cincinnati is \nthe boyhood home of President William Howard Taft, who was both \nPresident and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  Like everywhere else in our park system, all of these sites are \ngetting rundown. Why has this happened? Well, again, because every year \nwe appropriate funding for the operations of the park--for nature \nprograms, for rangers, for day-to-day operations and activities--but we \nhaven\'t provided enough money to provide for these maintenance needs.\n  Think about it in terms of your own family or your own home or your \nown business. Taking that big step and making those capital \nimprovements is a big, big cost, and we don\'t budget for that here very \nwell. So we have allowed these maintenance projects to build up, \nmeaning a lot of buildings, a lot of infrastructure--roads, bridges, \nwater systems--are deteriorating to the point that a lot of them are \nreally completely unusable.\n  I have seen this firsthand as I have visited our Ohio parks. Here are \na couple photos of some of the visits we have made.\n  I go to Cuyahoga Valley National Park frequently, as I said, and \nthere are always a lot of school field trips, a lot of hikers, a lot of \nother visitors. It is a great park, but it needs about $50 million in \nrepair--just that one park, Cuyahoga National Park.\n  The railroad track is in such bad repair--and it is behind me here--\nthat it is dangerous or will be soon to go on that scenic railroad. So \nwe have to fix the railroad tracks. Some of the trails seem to be \nfalling apart because of erosion. An $11 million budget is the annual \nbudget for that park, Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Again, it is the \nthirteenth most visited park in the country, yet they have a $50 \nmillion backlog--a $50 million backlog. So it is just not sustainable.\n  I also visited the Perry monument a couple of times in the last \ncouple of years, including last summer. Perry\'s Victory and \nInternational Peace Memorial is on the shores of Lake Erie. It honors \nthose who fought in the Battle of Lake Erie in the War of 1812, which \nwas such a critically important battle for our victory. It also \ncelebrates the long-lasting peace between the U.K., Canada, and the \nUnited States. So it is an important historical marker.\n  There I saw some of the $48 million in long-delayed maintenance needs \nat that site, which includes millions in needed repairs to a concrete \nseawall--and here is the seawall. You can see some of the damage to it. \nThere are also sinkholes behind me here.\n  We have to repair that seawall, but, boy, it is a big cost. But if \nyou don\'t repair it, you continue to have other damage, including the \nroad behind me, and, obviously, people are not permitted to go near the \nlake there.\n  So $48 million is a lot for that small memorial, small national park. \nThe visitors\' center there also needs upgrades. It needs to be made ADA \naccessible, an example--Americans with Disabilities Act. Again, the \nbudget for that park is miniscule, but the maintenance needs are huge.\n  It is not just our outdoor spaces that need work. The past 2 years I \nhave visited the Taft home in Cincinnati where President William Howard \nTaft was born and raised. The house is still in pretty good condition, \nbut there are infrastructure upgrades that have to be made--repairing \nthe roof, repairing some of the woodwork. You can see the roof here and \nsome of the mold. When you don\'t repair the roof, what happens? The \nroof leaks, and the walls get moldy, and the floor begins to couple.\n  So whether it is your house or whether it is our national parks, that \nis what is happening.\n  We have to do this in order to ensure that the costs don\'t expand \neven further, which is what happens, again, in your own home. If you \ndon\'t fix that roof, you have all kinds of other problems, and they \ncompound.\n  The compounding problem in our national parks is not just $12 \nbillion. If we don\'t address it, it will grow to be much greater than \nthat. The longer we wait, the more expensive it gets. The same story is \ntrue with all of our parks all around our country, and it is time for \nus to fix it.\n  By the way, people ask me: Well, how do you know what the most urgent \nneeds are? Because we require the parks to keep it. We require them to \ntell the U.S. Congress every year their highest priority needs, spell \nthem out, in specific terms, what is needed--what the cost is, how long \nthe repairs would take, and so on. This is why I said that they are \nshovel ready, because we know what these projects are.\n  Here is the deferred maintenance cost in Ohio, as an example, just \nfor Ohio--again, totaling $114 million. Here is the Perry\'s Victory \nMemorial, $48 million; here is the Cuyahoga Valley National Park at \nalmost $52 million.\n\n  Again, at some of our bigger parks around the country, the costs are \neven\n\n[[Page S2753]]\n\nhigher. So this is an opportunity for us to do the right thing by these \ntreasures that we have, to make sure they don\'t continue to \ndeteriorate. This is where our Restore Our Parks Act is so important to \npass.\n  As I said earlier, this legislation is going to support more than \n100,000 jobs and cut into that maintenance backlog. What is even better \nabout this legislation is that taxpayers aren\'t the ones footing the \nbill. Instead, this bill creates what is called the Legacy Restoration \nFund, which will provide $1.9 billion per year for 5 years from 50 \npercent of the unobligated on- and offshore energy revenue. Again, this \ncomes from on- and offshore oil, gas, and other energy projects.\n  This means we will have $9.5 billion to be divided across the \nNational Park Service and other Federal Land Management agencies. It \nwill not fund every needed repair, but the $6.5 billion our parks are \ngoing to get will address all of the high priority items, so 6.5 out of \n12, roughly half--a little more than half--of those projects, but it \ndoes comprise all of the high-priority items for our national parks.\n  It is a win-win, especially right now. This enables us to restore our \nparks and our public lands--these great national treasures. It supports \njobs at a time when people are anxious to get back to work, and it does \nall this by taking this funding that comes from the leases--oil, \nnatural gas, and other energy projects. It is good for our economy. We \nneed to get people back to work again, and it is an example of how \nCongress can pass laws that both create jobs and serve the public\'s \ninterests.\n  It is particularly good news that we are voting on it this week, \nbecause the quicker we act, the better.\n  I want to thank Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for allowing us to \nbring this to the floor. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle who have worked so hard on this legislation. Specifically, I \nwant to thank Senator Warner, who came up with this great idea of \nshifting the funding from the oil, gas, and other energy projects--some \nof these royalty moneys--into this particular project.\n  I have worked for years on parks. I am the author of the Centennial \nAct, which was back in 2016 for our national parks, which helps to get \npublic-private partnerships involved, which I strongly support. That \nhas helped a little bit on the maintenance, but it is not nearly enough \nmoney. So we need to do more, and that is what this legislation does.\n  I also want to thank Senator Alexander and Senator King for their \nwork on this national parks legislation.\n  I also want to thank my other colleagues who have been so involved in \nthis broader package. That would be Senator Gardner, Senator Manchin, \nSenator Daines. That is the Great American Outdoors Act. They helped me \nto put that together.\n  This is the right thing to do for our country at the right time.\n  I want to also say that the Trump administration strongly supports \nthis legislation, and that has been really important, too, to get it in \nthe budget, to be sure that the Office of Management and Budget, where \nI used to serve, is on board, because the funding here is not our \ntypical appropriations funding, and I thank them for that. I thank \nPresident Trump for helping us to ensure that this can come to the \nfloor today and can actually get passed by the U.S. Congress and then \nsigned into law.\n  Let\'s do it. On a bipartisan basis, let\'s do something positive this \nweek to move our country forward, to create more jobs, and to ensure \nthat our wonderful national parks are there for future generations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, today the Senate will take the first \nsteps toward passing the great American Outdoors Act, with the vote to \ninvoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the House bill, which will \nbe used as the underlying legislative vehicle.\n  The majority of my Senate colleagues have cosponsored this bill, and \nwe have an incredible opportunity to enact this important bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge that our Nation is in \nturmoil and hurting. We are still very much in the midst of both a \nhealth and economic crisis, and this weekend we saw millions of people \njoin peaceful demonstrations in communities across the country.\n  It is so important that we in Congress take action, and I am so \npleased that we have returned to legislating. There is no shortage of \nimportant business for us to address as a body.\n  The Great American Outdoors Act will create jobs while protecting and \nexpanding access to the great outdoors across our country for everyone, \nwhether that be hunting, fishing, or hiking in the Monongahela National \nForest in my great State of West Virginia or rafting down the Gauley \nRiver or learning about Civil War history--just to give a few examples \nof what my home State of West Virginia has to offer.\n  This is a legacy that we can all pass down to our grandchildren and \ngenerations to come, and it has been a long time coming.\n  I want to thank my good friend Senator Lisa Murkowski for working \nwith us through the committee process. I would also like to thank my \ncolleagues, Senators Gardner, Warner, Daines, Cantwell, Portman, King, \nAlexander, and Heinrich, for their work over many years on the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund--or as we call it, LWCF--and deferred \nmaintenance bills that are now joined together in the Great American \nOutdoors Act.\n  This bill would realize a goal that so many of us in this body have \nfought hard to attain for so long, to provide permanent, mandatory \nfunding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund at its fully \nauthorized level of $900 million annually.\n  Last year, the Senate passed a public lands package by an \noverwhelming vote of 92 to 8 that permanently authorized the LWCF--the \nmost successful land conservation program in our Nation\'s history. A \nvote that bipartisan is, unfortunately, unheard of today and speaks to \nthe overwhelming popularity of conservation programs in every State in \nthe country.\n  The day after we secured permanent authorization of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund, we made it clear that our next hurdle was \nachieving mandatory full funding. The Great American Outdoors Act \nincludes the mandatory LWCF funding bill that I introduced, along with \na lot of help from all my friends on both the Democratic and Republican \nsides.\n  We had strong bipartisan support for mandatory LWCF funding, with the \nmajority of the Senate cosponsoring the bill, and a strong bipartisan \nvote coming out of committee.\n  We need to secure this funding because since the LWCF was established \n55 years ago, over $22 billion--think about that--over $22 billion has \nbeen deposited in the LWCF fund but was never appropriated and instead \nwent into the Treasury.\n  Although every State and territory and almost every county has \nbenefited from LWCF, it has been fully funded only twice in the 55-year \nhistory--only twice have we gotten full funding. Think what we could \nhave done with that $22 billion.\n  Despite that, LWCF has been able to do wonderful things with the \nfunds that have been appropriated, which in recent years have been at \nhalf of the authorized funding level and, in previous years, less than \nthat. Just imagine what we can achieve for our country with this full \nfunding.\n  The LWCF is the primary conservation funding tool that helps provide \npublic access for hunting and fishing and recreational use of public \nlands. It also helps fund State and local parks. It helps maintain \nworking forests through the Forest Legacy Program. It protects historic \nbattlefields through the American Battlefield Protection Program, and \nit helps landowners voluntarily protect habitats for endangered \nspecies.\n  Permanent LWCF funding will improve access to public lands, improving\n\n[[Page S2754]]\n\naccess to hunting and fishing opportunities, and will ensure the \nprogram remains an important contributor to a strong and growing \noutdoor recreation economy that will benefit State and local economies \nthroughout our Nation.\n  A recent analysis from Boston University shows that at full funding \nof $900 million a year, the LWCF could support approximately 15,000 to \n28,000 jobs at a time when our country needs them most.\n  Passing permanent LWCF authorization last year was an important step, \nand we are so close to realizing the ultimate goal of fully fulfilling \nthe original intent of the LWCF Program and securing a permanent, \ndedicated funding source for the multiple conservation programs funded \nby the LWCF.\n  The Great American Outdoors Act also includes $9.5 billion for \ndeferred maintenance projects on Federal lands, with 70 percent of that \namount dedicated to our national parks. Senators Portman, Warner, \nAlexander, King, and many others worked so hard on that original \nlegislation, and I was proud to cosponsor and support as it went \nthrough the Senate\'s Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The \nlegislation will be the most significant reduction ever in eliminating \na major portion of the deferred maintenance backlog of our national \nparks and public lands.\n  The impact of failing to fund our national parks and maintenance for \nso long is clear to see. Last year, I visited Pearl Harbor with my \nfamily, and I was incredibly disappointed to see the state of disrepair \nit was in. There were faded and torn signs and audio displays and \nlights that were not working. It was an embarrassment.\n  The infrastructure projects that will be funded through this bill are \ncritical to protecting many of our national treasures. The LWCF funding \nwill provide a significant benefit to the national outdoor recreation \neconomy. Investing in deferred maintenance projects will create over \n40,000 direct jobs and over 100,000 total jobs, and that is just for \ndeferred maintenance projects in our national parks. This bill also \nincludes funding for deferred maintenance projects at other land \nmanagement agencies and Bureau of Indian Education schools.\n  The Great American Outdoors Act will help us to be good stewards of \nour public lands while, at the same time, creating thousands of new \njobs--a bipartisan win-win, which we should have more of. We have \nbroad, bipartisan support, with 60 Senators signing on, which is \nrepresentative of how important these bills are to every State and \nevery county in every State. We have support from the administration \nand unwavering support from over 900 conservation and sportsmen groups \nthroughout the Nation. It is a shining example of Democrats and \nRepublicans coming together to put politics aside to do what is best \nfor conserving the natural resources of this great Nation.\n  The passage of this bill will be an historic achievement, and I \nbelieve this will be one of the most significant conservation bills \never enacted into law. What a legacy all of us can walk away with and \nlook at our children and grandchildren, knowing that we have helped \nprotect our wonderful national parks and outdoor recreation \nopportunities. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in voting yes to \ninvoke cloture this evening and begin consideration of the Great \nAmerican Outdoors Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                       Business Before the Senate\n\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam President, this weekend, I was thinking about \nthe toll that the recent loss of fellowship has really taken on the \nAmerican people.\n  I think everyone would agree that, over the past few months, we have \nreally felt levels of loneliness, anger, and frustration that we have \nnever experienced in our lives. For most of us, it has been a long time \nsince we have been able to gather with friends and family or to go to a \nchurch service. This isolation has brought to the surface conflict that \nhas been brewing for a very long time. For many years, powerful forces \nin politics and popular culture have insisted that there is nothing we \ncan\'t learn from interacting with one another online. Technology has \nbrought the world together under the premise of this false intimacy and \nconvinced millions of people that what they see on their screens is all \nthey need to know about the world.\n  There are many things that Americans can rightfully disagree about, \nespecially during an election year, but contrary to what our social \nmedia timelines would lead us to believe, most Americans have held onto \nthe lessons we all should have learned when we were mere children. When \nwe were little, we learned that, as Americans, we have a duty to fight \nhatred wherever we find it, to be kind to one another, to practice the \nGolden Rule. Instead of giving in to stereotypes and assumptions, we \nshould reject our own biases and, instead, meet people where they are, \nwith open arms and listening ears and loving hearts, and truly listen \nto what they have to say.\n  There are destructive forces at work in this country that want the \nAmerican people to forget these lessons and, instead, make a false \nchoice between putting their beliefs into practice and protecting the \ninstitutions and symbols that define our Republic. They want to \nconvince you that this Nation is broken beyond repair. That is their \ngoal: to undermine what you believe and to convince you that the path \nforward must be forged at the expense of faith, hope, and free speech, \nfree expression. This is a lie. Worse, it is an obvious lie to anyone \nwho has studied our Nation\'s precious history. For hundreds of years, \nthe American people have persevered in spite of conflict and more--\ncivil unrest, economic downturns, and neighborly disagreements.\n\n  That is what we are going to do now here in Washington, back at home \nin Tennessee, and in our communities. Instead of allowing Congress to \ncome to a standstill, we will make and encourage strong policies that \nprotect the American people. Even though the mainstream media has \ntemporarily forgotten that we are in the midst of a global pandemic, \nthe Senate has not forgotten that. We will continue to monitor the \nprogress of businessowners as they slowly repair the damage done to our \neconomy by extended lockdowns and do everything we can to make sure our \nscientists have the resources they need to develop a vaccine for COVID-\n19.\n  Our relationship with China has changed forever, and we must pass \nlegislation to reflect that. Our supply chains that provide \npharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and critical national resources are \nall vulnerable to manipulation by Beijing. We should pass legislation \nto incentivize domestic manufacturing, starting with the SAM-C bill \nthat Senator Menendez and I have offered in this Chamber. This would \nsupport stateside pharmaceutical production.\n  We must also continue working with Big Tech to create responsible \nprivacy guidelines and protect consumer data from Chinese hackers. Last \nweek in Judiciary, we heard testimony that confirmed a history of \ncorruption at the highest levels of the Obama-led Justice Department. \nThere are many, even in this Chamber, who would rather not talk about \nthat, but we must press forward with this investigation. We have to get \nto the bottom of what happened at the Department of Justice and with \nthe FBI during Operation Crossfire Hurricane, and we will do all of \nthis. We will do the job that we were elected to do while we maintain \nlaw and order and insist that those enforcing the law are accountable \nto the citizens whom they are sworn to serve and protect.\n  To those who insist that we as a nation are irreparably broken, I \nwant you to know that I and the American people have taken note of your \nwords, and now I hope that you will take note of mine. This country is \nstrong. Our people are resilient. Over the course of just a few months, \nmany of them have lost everything. They have lost the lives of family \nmembers. They have lost their livelihoods. Their lives and their \nfutures--every waking moment of every day--are filled with uncertainty, \nbut they still hold tight to those lessons they learned when they were \nchildren. They know that they were endowed by their Creator with the \nliberties that make America special and that no force on Earth has the \npower to separate them from their faith in God and their country and in \none another.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                               H.R. 1957\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise to speak about the historic \nvote to happen shortly that will advance conservation and public lands \nprojects,\n\n[[Page S2755]]\n\ncalled the Great American Outdoors Act. I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this important legislation.\n  First, I thank everyone who has been involved in this legislation--\nSenator Gardner, who just joined us on the floor; Senator Manchin, who \nspoke earlier; Senator Daines; Senator Warner; Senator Portman, who \nalso spoke earlier; Senator Alexander; Senator King; Senator Burr; and \nthen several other Senators who will, I know, participate tomorrow as a \ngroup and speak--Senators Tester, Bennet, Heinrich, and so many more.\n  This coalition has said we should spend the money in the fund for \nLWCF and combine it with taking care of parks\' backlog. This has been a \npriority of two different groups of Senators who have worked together \nto try to pass this legislation.\n  I also thank Senators Portman, Alexander, King, and Warner and my \nHouse colleague, Representative Kilmer, for working so diligently on \nthe parks\' backlog. I thank Senator Alexander specifically, who has \nbeen one of the champions of the parks\' backlog.\n  Just a few years ago, I remember I asked him: Lamar, do you think we \nare really going to get $6.5 billion spent on the backlog?\n  He said: We are going to try our darned best.\n  Apparently, Lamar Alexander\'s darned best today has been a success in \nhelping us to move this forward.\n  Again, I thank the prime sponsors of the bill, Senator Gardner and \nSenator Manchin, for their steadfast work on the LWCF and the parks\' \nbacklog. I also thank Senator Burr, who is a steadfast champion of the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund, and who, with me, helped to sponsor \nthe permanent reauthorization of the Fund and tried to get the funds \nspent. This effort has continued over many decades by many colleagues, \nincluding by two former Senators, Bingaman and Baucus, who were both \ngiants in all of this.\n  I thank everybody for their important efforts over the years that \nhave gotten us to this point today.\n  Why are we here? A lot of people would ask: In the middle of a \npandemic, an economic crisis, and a big struggle to energize the need \nfor civil rights and equality, why are we talking about a public lands \nbill?\n\n  As I said, we are here because there is a lot of history behind the \noutdoors economy and the economy itself of the activities that generate \nan economic return from having public lands. This has been a juggernaut \nfor us. There is $887 billion in consumer spending every year, and that \nhelps to support about 7.6 million jobs.\n  While some are probably asking, ``How did we get so lucky to have \nthis coalition of bipartisan Senators come together with regard public \nlands and public land investment, and why can\'t we take that same magic \nand make it happen in other places?\'\' I encourage my colleagues not \nonly to get this legislation done and think about how we did get it \ndone together but also to think about how special public lands are for \nthe United States of America.\n  Public lands are part of our history. They are part of what we have \ninvested in on behalf of the citizens of the United States so you have \na place to recreate, to hunt, to fish, to find solace, to find \nrecovery, to find enjoyment, to find amazement when you see the \nwonderful places, particularly in the State of Washington.\n  Because the LWCF is paid for by royalties from oil companies that \ndrill off our shores, these investments don\'t cost the taxpayers a dime \nor add to our deficit. This bill will be injecting money into our \neconomy, creating more jobs, and fixing the repairs that we need to our \nlands and lands infrastructure.\n  Over the last half a century, the Land and Water Conservation Fund \nhas supported over 42,000 State and local projects, and it has included \nan investment of $725 million in the State of Washington. It has helped \nus to expand access to clean rivers, hunting lands, forestlands, and to \nimprove our national parks. It has been a critical protection tool for \nheritage areas and for augmenting wildlife refuges across our State. In \nfact, the LWCF fund has supported 98 percent of the parks in counties \nacross the United States of America. At one point in time, 98 percent \nof the counties across this country have used the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  In the State of Washington, it has helped us to establish iconic \nplaces like Gas Works Park; Bidwell Park, which is near Spokane; the \nBurnt Bridge Creek Trail, which winds through Vancouver; and the Warren \nG. Magnuson Park at Sand Point, which has been used for valuable \nconservation easements and to help popular forest legacy programs that \npartner with timber owners to promote sustainable forestry.\n  The Great American Outdoors Act has helped us to make a decision that \nhas been long debated and long disputed. David Brooks, from the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources, could tell you how many \ntimes we have had to debate both the backlog and the LWCF issues and \nhow people have wanted to spend those dollars. It has been a very, very \nchallenging issue for years.\n  Besides saying that we are going to take money and put it forward to \npermanently fund the LWCF, the bill also says that we are going to \ntackle the backlog and maintenance. I mentioned the $6.5 billion \ninfusion for that maintenance. For us in the State of Washington, with \nour many national parks, there is $262 million for deferred maintenance \ncosts to include repairs to the water treatment system at Olympic \nNational Park. It could help us with $186 million in deferred \nmaintenance at Mount Rainier. It could help us with miles of trails and \naccess to campgrounds. It could also help us in the very important area \nof expanding access.\n  There are other projects in the State of Washington, and sometimes, \nwhen we don\'t take care of our backlog and maintenance, we don\'t get \nthe dollars because they go to the larger parks. So this will help us \nto make sure we don\'t ignore that crumbling infrastructure or the \ndeteriorating hiking trails or the aging visitors centers. It will help \nus with projects like the $28 million needed for the Lake Roosevelt \nNational Recreation Area, the $2.6 million for the Whitman Mission \nNational Historic Site, the $43 million that is needed for the Fort \nVancouver National Historic Site in southwest Washington, the $18 \nmillion for the North Cascades National Park in Washington, and the $5 \nmillion for the San Juan Island National Historic Park in the northern \npart of our State.\n  As you can see, the State of Washington is definitely in the outdoor \nindustry business. We have been very blessed with a beautiful \nenvironment, and we have been very blessed with an economy that has \nbeen based on those beautiful outdoors. So we are very happy today that \nour colleagues have joined in this bipartisan effort to say that public \nlands really do mean a lot to our Nation and that they deserve an \nupgrade--a facelift--an investment, and a commitment to keep funding \nthe things that will allow us to expand public access to them.\n  It is the legislation that we need to pass even in this unbelievable \ntime of so many other critical issues. I believe now, more than ever, \nour local parks and our urban green space can give solace to Americans \nwho need refuge from all of the issues we are dealing with. Now, more \nthan ever, we need to promote access to the shared public lands so that \nevery American can get access, and the American people have had an \nincredibly difficult several few months. Let\'s give them something to \nthink about for their futures--access to the great outdoors, which will \nhelp all of us in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nher leadership on our great public lands and the bill, the Great \nAmerican Outdoors Act, that we will be voting on this week and debating \ninto next week. What an historic occasion for the U.S. Senate. We don\'t \noften have the chance to make history. This week, we do. So thank you \nto the Senator from Washington.\n  June is, of course, the Great Outdoors Month. Since 1998, when \nPresident Clinton started with 1 week of the Great Outdoors Week, it \nhas since expanded and has been observed every year, beginning with \nthose Great American Outdoors Weeks in 1998 to the entire month of June \ncelebrating that we do today.\n\n[[Page S2756]]\n\n  This week, we are debating landmark legislation, the Great American \nOutdoors Act, that brings two ideas together that have been worked on \nby so many of my colleagues in this Chamber for so long.\n  I introduced this legislation with Senator Manchin, along with so \nmany other bipartisan champions for the outdoors and our great public \nlands and spaces. The Great American Outdoors Act combines $1.9 billion \na year for 5 years for deferred maintenance at the National Park \nService, the U.S. Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the \nBureau of Land Management, which is now headquartered in Grand \nJunction, CO, and the Bureau of Indian Education schools, and permanent \nannual funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the crown jewel \nof our conservation programs, at $900 million per year.\n  Let\'s revisit how we arrived at this historic moment. Last year, the \nSenate came together, in bipartisan fashion, and passed the most \nsignificant conservation measure in over a decade. The John D. Dingell, \nJr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, among other things, \nincluded the permanent authorization of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund.\n  Congress had established the LWCF in 1965, with the idea of using \nrevenue generated from offshore energy development to fund improvements \non public lands at no cost to the taxpayer. I repeat that again--at no \ncost to the taxpayer. The LWCF has increased access for Americans \neverywhere to hunt, fish, camp, and enjoy recreation activities on \ntheir public lands, the lands we own and hold as a country.\n  It has protected and expanded access for conservation in all 50 \nStates, the territories, and in nearly every county. LWCF is the crown \njewel, as I said, of our Nation\'s conservation programs, and it has \nbroad bipartisan support. Yet, for decades, short-term authorizations \nand uncertain funding levels hampered the ability of the conservation \ncommunity to come up with the long-term plans that we need to protect \nour most cherished landscapes.\n  The John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act \ntook care of one of those problems. We actually managed to solve a \nproblem, but it was just half of the picture. The permanent \nreauthorization of the program guaranteed the full $900 million \nauthorization would be set aside every year going forward. We won that \nfight. Together, we passed that legislation.\n  However, the fight for fully funding the program continued. While I \nam appreciative of the ever-increasing levels of funding we have \nsuccessfully fought to secure--in fact, we have seen some of the \nhighest funding over the last year or 2 years than we have seen in over \n15 years that we have successfully fought to secure in the Senate--it \nis still not what was agreed to. It is still not what was agreed to \nwhen this program was created in 1965.\n  The Great American Outdoors Act fixes this issue. It guarantees that \nthe full $900 million that is sent in to the LWCF trust fund are spent \nevery year and not diverted for other purposes. I would like to share \nsome of the landscapes in my home State that LWCF has preserved for the \npublic and for generations to come.\n  You can see this picture, this incredible, awesome, majestic \nlandscape of the Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve. It is \nlocated in the approximately 122-mile-long San Luis Valley in Southeast \nColorado. The dunes in the park are the tallest found anywhere in North \nAmerica, and right now people are visiting to experience the seasonal \nflow of Medano Creek, which forms in front of the dunes as snow melts \nin the spring and early summer. It is the closest thing that we see to \nbeachfront property every spring at the sand dunes.\n  As you can imagine, the ecosystem in this area is incredibly \ndelicate. You see, the sand dunes are here because of basically the \nhydrostatic charge that is created from the groundwater when it comes \nto the sand particles. It is that water that forms around the sand that \nholds the sand dunes in place. Without the water underneath it, the \nsand dunes just blow away, and they are not there.\n  The sand dunes sit next to what are some of the most important \nwetlands in the State of Colorado. LWCF funds were used to protect \nthose wetlands and to facilitate a transfer to an existing refuge, \nwhile also helping to protect the dunes. LWCF was able to protect the \nland that protected the water that keeps the dunes in place.\n  In northwestern Colorado--we go to the next picture--a ranch sits \nalong the banks of the Yampa River, which flows into Cross Mountain \nCanyon, then downstream to Dinosaur National Monument. If you have ever \nbeen to Dinosaur National Monument, you know what an incredible \ntreasure that is. It straddles the States of Colorado and Utah. The \nCross Mountain Canyon run is one of the best white-water rafting trips \nin the State, and if it is one of the best white-water rafting trips in \nthe State, you can guarantee that it makes it one of the best in the \ncountry because of what we have to offer in Colorado. There is also a \nvery healthy elk population that facilitates seasonal hunting, and \nobviously the fishing is great as well.\n  Throughout this area of public land--through both the monument and \nlands under the Bureau of Land Management--and private land, access to \nour public lands is difficult for those who travel to this area of \nColorado from all over the world to hunt, to fish, to raft, and more.\n  With a small amount of LWCF funding through the Forest Legacy \nProgram, which we also fund through LWCF, the ranch on the banks of the \nYampa River was able to enter a conservation easement. This \nprotected and enhanced access to tens of thousands of surrounding acres \nof Federal lands. You see, we not only have the opportunity to continue \nprotecting our public lands, but there are public lands that we don\'t \nhave access to because you can\'t get to it. So utilizing a program like \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund helps the American people have \naccess to what they already hold.\n\n  In southwest Colorado, we go to another successful Forest Legacy \nProgram project that protects vital wildlife habitat and a watershed \nthat provides water to thousands of people. The Sawtooth Ranch is \nvisible from the San Juan Skyway, one of the most spectacular places on \nGod\'s Earth--one of 31 designated scenic All-American roads. It is also \nvisible from Mount Sneffels, one of Colorado\'s famous fourteeners.\n  Outdoor recreation of every kind takes place in the area next to the \nranch to support the local economy, and the protection of the ranch has \nhelped facilitate even greater opportunities.\n  Federal lands like the ones I have shown you are incredibly popular \ndestinations for tourists from all over the world, as well as \nrecreational enthusiasts. In 2018, Rocky Mountain National Park was the \nthird most visited national park in the country.\n  There were 4.9 million people that visited the park last year, \nsetting a new record. Just decades prior to 2009--think about this--\nthat was 4.9 million people in just the last year. In 2009, that \nvisitation number was only 2.8 million a year.\n  The explosion of visitation numbers is not contained just to the \nlands maintained by the National Park Service. The entire Federal land \nsystem is supporting a recreation economy that has become a major \neconomic powerhouse because as more people go to places like Sawtooth \nRanch and as more people go to places like Rocky National Park, they \nare pushed out to other areas of Arapaho and Roosevelt National \nForests. They are pushed out to the north sand dune, the BLM land, and \nmore use and more use and more opportunity.\n  But the Federal investment and infrastructure that supports these \ngreat landscapes and the recreation economies they facilitate has not \nkept pace, and we know that it has not kept pace with the use of the \nlands. In Colorado, that translates to the third most visited national \npark in the country, which saw 4.9 million visitors last year, having \nan $84 million maintenance backlog. In total, Colorado\'s units managed \nby the National Park System have a $247 million backlog of deferred \nmaintenance needs.\n  The Forest Service in Colorado has an astonishing $325 million \nmaintenance backlog. When you think about that pattern repeated on \nFederal lands and in our parks across 49 other States,\n\n[[Page S2757]]\n\nyou begin to understand how we arrived at a systemwide $20 billion \nbacklog.\n  The Great American Outdoors Act will provide an annual funding level \nof $1.9 billion over the next 5 years to a restoration fund, for which \nmoney can be used solely for those deferred maintenance projects, and \nthis is all paid for. It is all paid for by revenues associated with \nonshore and offshore energy development. This will allow the land \nmanagement agencies to address the highest priority projects to bring \nour outdoor recreation economy into the 21st century for the enjoyment \nof the 22nd, the 23rd, and the 24th centuries of this great Nation.\n  And the 21st century, of course, is where it needs to be and where we \nstart. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, hunting, fishing, \ncamping, hiking, paddling, and other outdoor recreation activities \ncontribute to a total of $778 billion annually to the economy and \nsupport 5.2 million American jobs.\n  This sector accounts for 2.2 percent of the U.S. gross domestic \nproduct. Each year our Federal public lands contribute nearly $60 \nbillion to the American economy and support more than 400,000 jobs. Now \nis the time to invest in our recreation infrastructure. Now is the time \nto invest in this job opportunity.\n  You know, prior to the pandemic, we were living in the midst of one \nof the greatest economies the world has ever seen. Unemployment was at \nrecord lows, wages were growing, and people were spending their hard-\nearned dollars in our communities supporting local economies, fishing, \nhiking, enjoying the great outdoors after spending 3 months in the \ngreat indoors. Our mountain towns and gateway communities were hit hard \nby COVID-19. That first wave decimated economies in our Western Slope \nof Colorado. The ski season ended early. Restaurants closed and hotels \nemptied. The jobs that are created and sustained by this bill, as we \nrecover from the pandemic, will be a vital component of our overall \neconomic recovery as Americans get back to work and back to playing \nafter they have worked so hard--working hard and playing hard--two \ngreat American values.\n  As we have this vote tonight on cloture, I hope my colleagues will \nsupport this motion to support our public lands and the communities \nthat sustain them by supporting the Great American Outdoors Act.\n  I will leave it with this. Enos Mills, one of the fathers of Rocky \nMountain National Park, once said this about our public lands:\n  The trail compels you to know yourself and to be yourself, and puts \nyou in harmony with the universe. It makes you glad to be living. It \ngives health, hope, and courage, and it extends that touch of nature \nwhich tends to make you kind.\n  I can think of no better piece of legislation on our public lands \nthan to work our way to find a little bit more kindness, a little bit \nmore hope, a little bit more strength, and a great deal of opportunity\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                                Protests\n\n  Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I thank you for the recognition, and I \nthank Senator Gardner for his hard work on this excellent piece of \nlegislation.\n  Today, our Nation is in pain. It is the pain of centuries of deeply \nembedded racial injustice. This Nation has watched in horror as the \nlast 8 minutes and 46 seconds of George Floyd\'s life were cruelly and \nneedlessly taken from him by a police officer.\n  Our Nation grieves for the families of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, \nand so many other innocent Black men and women violently taken from \ntheir families and loved ones. This is a pain all too familiar for too \nmany Black Americans. This is a moment of reckoning for our Nation.\n  Black Americans have borne the brunt of this systemic racism, as have \nHispanic and Native American communities in New Mexico and across the \nNation.\n  So many of our officers protect and serve with honor and integrity, \nbut we cannot continue to sweep police brutality and racial inequality \nunder the rug, ignoring these painful legacies until the next tragedy. \nThere are thousands of Americans of every political stripe across the \nNation who have come out in peaceful protest demanding change.\n  Now, we know there are a few--a very small few--who are exploiting \nour Nation\'s pain and using violence to disrupt. We unequivocally \ncondemn all acts of violence and call for nonviolent but urgent action. \nBy calling for the U.S. military to quell protests, as the President \nand some in this body have done, that crosses a line between civilian \nand military rule that is antithetical to American traditions. Instead \nof calling for American soldiers to repress their fellow citizens \nexercising their First Amendment rights, I am calling for action from \nthis body.\n  Today, Senators Booker and Harris introduced the Justice in Policing \nAct, a bill I am proud to cosponsor. This landmark bill holds police \nmisconduct accountable in courts of law. It shines a light on police \npractices, requiring transparency, and ends racial profiling and \nmandates racial bias training. It bans choke holds and requires body \ncams and makes lynching a Federal crime.\n  This is a moment of reckoning for our Nation. I call upon the Senate \nmajority to join with us to pass this long overdue legislation as soon \nas possible.\n\n\n                               H.R. 1957\n\n  Madam President, I now turn to the bill before us, the Great American \nOutdoors Act. Our country\'s public lands are at the very core of our \nnational identity. They protect our national heritage, our lands, \nwaters, and our wildlife for future generations. Our national parks, \nmonuments, and wildlife refuges are irreplaceable treasures--sources of \nbeauty, of solitude, recreation, and of renewal.\n  From the Grand Canyon to Stonewall National Monument to the city park \nin our neighborhood, our public lands sustain our people, and we owe it \nto these special places and to ourselves and to our children to sustain \nthem for the future.\n  Today, I stand here in strong support of the Great American Outdoors \nAct, legislation that at long last fully and permanently funds the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund and invests in our public lands for the \nfuture.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund was passed in 1964. My father, \nStewart Udall, was Secretary of the Department of the Interior at the \ntime, and I am proud he helped establish the LWCF. As Secretary, he was \ntroubled by how difficult it was to expand public lands. At that time, \nthe Federal Government would redesignate existing Federal lands to \ncreate a new national park or a new wildlife refuge or rely on private \ndonations to expand, but the Congress itself resisted appropriating \nfunds to create new public lands.\n  At a wilderness conference in 1963, my father bluntly said: ``[T]he \npath of land conservation that our government has used for more than \nhalf a century is running into a dead end.\'\'\n  But he had conceived of a new path forward, ``an entirely new \nwatershed in the history of the conservation movement in the United \nStates,\'\' he told them. Just 3 weeks before the conference, President \nKennedy had sent Congress a new piece of legislation called the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund Act. My father and others conceived of a \nFederal fund that would both generate money to acquire new Federal \nlands and provide States with funding to expand recreational \nopportunities. The bill passed Congress the next year.\n  The LWCF has been called our Nation\'s most successful conservation \nprogram. It is wildly popular with the American people, and it has \ntouched every corner of our Nation--in rural and urban areas with \nparks, forests, wildlife refuges, trails, wild and scenic river \ncorridors, historic monuments, and cultural sites. LWCF has funded \n42,000 stateside projects. In my home State alone, it has helped over \n1,200 such projects found in every 1 of our 33 counties.\n  After the LWCF was enacted, it became clear that the initial funding \nsources were too limited. My father persuaded President Johnson to \nsupport using Federal revenues from oil and gas leases in the Outer \nContinental Shelf to fund the program. His plan converted revenue from \na nonrenewable source into a permanent protection for our renewable \nnatural world.\n\n  While Congress amended the act to include this funding source and \nlater\n\n[[Page S2758]]\n\nauthorized the fund to actually annually accrue $900 million, the full \npromise of LWCF was not yet fulfilled.\n  Throughout my career, I have championed increases to the LWCF, but it \ndeserves the dedicated funding my father and many others envisioned. \nLast year, Congress finally permanently authorized the fund, a historic \nvictory for conservation.\n  It is long past time we take the next step and permanently direct the \nfull $900 million to the fund every year. Not only has the LWCF met its \nconservation mission 100 times over; it has helped fuel the outdoor \nrecreation economy and support local economies, especially in rural \nareas throughout the Nation.\n  Since the creation of the fund, the outdoor industry has grown \ntremendously. It is now an $887 billion industry that powers 7.6 \nmillion jobs. That includes nearly 100,000 direct jobs in New Mexico, \ndriving $2.8 billion in wages and nearly $10 billion in consumer \nspending.\n  Fully and permanently funding LWCF will translate directly into \neconomic growth. We need to energize our economy now more than ever as \nwe work our way out of the financial crisis created by COVID-19.\n  Throughout our history, we have seen investing in public lands \nenergizes both our economy and our national spirit. Conservation must \nbe a centerpiece of our recovery at this challenging time for our \nNation.\n  Indeed, the economic benefits of the LWCF are great, but the human \nbenefits to ourselves, our families, and our communities may be \ngreater.\n  One of the most recent LWCF projects in New Mexico is the Valle de \nOro National Wildlife Refuge, the first urban wildlife refuge in the \nSouthwest. Here is a photograph of our State\'s newest refuge: Valle de \nOro. The Rio Grande runs along this refuge, which boasts an amazing \narray of wild birds, including sandhill cranes--which you see here--the \ngreater roadrunner, and the American kestrel. The $6 million \ncontribution from the Land and Water Conservation Fund helped make the \nvision of this urban oasis a reality.\n  Valle de Oro is special to me because it introduces young people--\noften Hispanic young people with limited means and limited access to \nnature--to their first outdoor experience. It introduces kids to a \nworld of wonder and a lifetime of connection to nature. And it is just \ndown the street.\n  As Richard Louv discussed so eloquently in his seminal book ``Last \nChild in the Woods\'\' and backed up with peer-reviewed study after \nstudy, our children need nature, and we suffer spiritually and \nphysically when that bond is lost.\n  So as we take this historic action to add to our national heritage, I \nam glad we are also addressing the $19 billion worth of deferred \nmaintenance on our existing public lands. Like the other days of the \nCivilian Conservation Corps, this work is especially timely and will \nhelp our economic recovery at a time of historic unemployment.\n  It is good news that use of our public lands has increased so \ndramatically over time. More than 1 billion visitors enjoy our Federal \npublic lands each year. The infrastructure on these public lands--our \nroads, bridges, and trails; our campgrounds, marinas; and our drinking \nwater and sewer systems--are wearing out. Historic buildings are \nfalling apart. Trails are washed out. Roads and bridges can\'t be used. \nWater lines and sewer systems don\'t function. The list is long--$19 \nbillion long.\n  In New Mexico alone, we have $121 million worth of deferred \nmaintenance needed at iconic places like Carlsbad Caverns, White Sands \nNational Park, Chaco Culture National Historical Park, the Gila Cliff \nDwellings, and Bandelier National Monument.\n  The Great American Outdoors Act represents a substantial downpayment \ntoward maintaining, repairing, and renovating the infrastructure on our \npublic lands--allocating up to $1.9 billion annually for 5 years. This \nrepresents Congress\'s most significant commitment to date to the long-\nterm future of our public lands.\n  The American people own these precious resources. We need to maintain \nthe American people\'s public spaces so that all of us can continue to \nsafely and enjoyably visit these special places. How we take care of \nthese public places says a lot about our Nation.\n  Our Nation\'s conservation heritage is uniquely American. The bill \nbefore us strengthens our Nation\'s commitment to conservation, to \nprotecting our wild places, to preserving our history and cultures, and \nto nurturing our bonds with nature and the great outdoors.\n  I urge every Member here to wholeheartedly support our heritage and \nvote in favor of this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Boozman). The Senator from Montana\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto finish my remarks prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today we have the opportunity to make \nhistory in the U.S. Senate. Together, we can move forward with passing \none of the most important conservation bills in decades.\n  In fact, standing here today, I can tell you something. There are not \nmany issues that bring Republicans and Democrats together, but \nsomething actually does that, and that is protecting our public lands.\n  If you remember, about a year and a half ago, we passed a major \nbipartisan lands package where we permanently authorized a conservation \nprogram--something we are here to talk about today--and that is the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund.\n  Today we have the opportunity to move forward on this bipartisan \nGreat American Outdoors Act, a conservation bill that will provide full \nand permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and \nfinally tackle this massive maintenance backlog that is plaguing our \npublic lands, including our national parks.\n  How we got here today isn\'t by chance. In fact, on February 27, I sat \ndown with my colleague Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, Leader \nMcConnell, and President Trump in the White House--we were in the \nRoosevelt room, in fact--to pitch a simple idea: Let\'s set aside \npolitical gridlock, and let\'s pass the most important conservation law \nin decades.\n  In fact, I showed the President of the United States, President \nTrump, pictures of land and water conservation projects in Montana--the \nTenderfoot Creek and the Falls Creek projects--and we talked about the \nimportance of this program in places like Montana.\n  As a fifth-generation Montanan, I know just how important our public \nlands are to protecting and preserving our Montana way of life, from \nfishing on the Yellowstone River to summiting Granite Peak, which I did \nback in college--in fact, the week after that, I summited the Grand \nTeton down in Wyoming--or backpacking in The Barracks, which we do \nvirtually every summer. I have enjoyed our great outdoors, and this is \nan appreciation and something that Cindy and I have passed on to our \nfour children. In fact, I proposed to my sweet wife Cindy on top of \nHyalite Peak, a peak over 10,000 feet just south of Bozeman, in July of \n1986.\n  Montana is a place where you can still go down to Walmart and buy an \nelk tag or deer tag over the counter and, literally, within minutes \nhave access to our public lands to hunt and fish.\n  As Montana\'s voice in the U.S. Senate, I have made it one of my \nhighest priorities to protect and expand access to our public lands, \nand the Land and Water Conservation Fund is a critical tool for \naccomplishing that.\n  Think about this for a moment: Over 70 percent of the fishing \naccesses across Montana are funded through this conservation program. \nSportsmen, conservationists, and outdoor enthusiasts will agree that \nthis program is critical for conservation and important for protecting \nour great outdoor heritage and our Montana way of life.\n  This conservation program is important for creating and protecting \njobs for our outdoor economy. This program is also an important tool \nfor land managers and agencies to address the checkerboard land \nownership. We see that in Montana. Addressing that checkerboard \nownership makes a lot of sense.\n  You see, over 1\\1/2\\ million acres of Federal land in our State sit \nentirely landlocked. In many cases, specific land and water \nconservation projects in Montana will help consolidate land\n\n[[Page S2759]]\n\nownership that can make overall landscape management less complicated \nand easier for agencies.\n  In fact, the Land and Water Conservation Fund was passed with the \nintent to be funded at $900 million per year, and, every single year, \n$900 million plus goes into that trust account, but nowhere close to \nthat level of funding is actually appropriated\n  In reality, if Congress wanted to, they don\'t have to fund the \nprogram at all. In fact, only twice--going back to 1965--has it been \nfunded at the $900 million mark. What we see each year is the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund gets raided by Congress, and millions of \ndollars are spent on other programs.\n  Mandatory funding would create certainty for land managers that the \nfull $900 million goes toward that program every year moving forward.\n  Now, we must also support and preserve our country\'s beloved national \nparks. Our national parks are what set us apart from the rest of the \nworld. I like to think of them as our office of first impressions, and \nwe need to do a better job taking care of them, be better stewards.\n  With record visitations and increased visitation each year, park \ninfrastructure has inevitably experienced wear and tear, and this has \nled to a significant maintenance backlog. Today, there is nearly $12 \nbillion in maintenance backlog facing our national parks across the \nNation, including $700 million in Glacier and Yellowstone National \nParks and an additional $34 million throughout the State in places like \nLittle Bighorn Battlefield and the Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Park.\n  The bill also addresses the backlog in our Forest Service, BLM, and \nFish and Wildlife Service lands. In Montana, our forests are critical \nfor outdoor recreation as well as our wood products industry. It makes \nsense that we protect and maintain access to these lands for future \ngenerations because the wonders of our public lands are unique to any \nother country in the world.\n  Montanans were brought up with a love of the outdoors and a sense of \nresponsibility to conserve as well as maintain them. To us, protecting \nour public lands is about preserving the way of life unique to our \nwestern frontier heritage.\n  It is an honor to serve the people of Montana in the U.S. Senate and \nto bring this vote--a vote decades in the making--before the U.S. \nSenate today. I urge my Senate colleagues to stand with me to pass this \nbipartisan Great American Outdoors Act.\n  I am ready to get this done for Montana. Future generations are \ncounting on our vote today, and I believe, truly, it is a conservative \nprinciple to conserve. The Founders\' vision for America was a frontier \nnation, a wild nation.\n  What made America distinct from industrial Europe and all the other \ncountries in the world was our outdoors, for, of course, what is \nAmerica without Lewis and Clark?\n  I will leave you with this last thought from Teddy Roosevelt. This \nwas in the context of thinking about our national parks and our public \nlands: ``We have fallen heirs to the most glorious heritage a people \never received, and each one must do his part if we wish to show that \nthe nation is worthy of its good fortune.\'\'\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                                Protests\n\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, a week ago, I did a television interview \non race relations in America. They asked me to talk a little bit about \nwhat happened in Tulsa in 1921.\n  The worst race massacre in American history occurred in Tulsa in \n1921. It was May 31, overnight, into June 1. I was on television a week \nago, describing the event of how a group of White rioters had marched \ninto Greenwood--what was called Black Wall Street--and had killed up to \n300 people there. They had set Greenwood on fire, destroying homes and \nbusinesses.\n  Many people at home don\'t know this, but everyone in this Chamber \ndoes. As I was talking, I was just talking to a camera lens and \ncouldn\'t tell what was on TV at the time. There were pictures of a town \nin the United States that was currently on fire while I was describing \na race massacre that had happened 99 years ago that weekend.\n  We have come a long way with the issue of race in America, but we \nclearly have a very long way to go. We have four centuries of racial \ninequality stacked on top of each other. While we break through those \nthings step by step, we have things that we can do. I have been on the \nphone for days with friends and with people whom I know from all over \nOklahoma--from all backgrounds--and have been talking about race \nrelationships and where we go as a nation. Some people throw up their \nhands and say: I don\'t know what to do. Many people have an idea, but \neveryone wants the situation to get better.\n  What is interesting is the dialogue about protesters and rioters and \npolice officers. I share openly with them that I don\'t judge protesters \nand rioters the same. Some people do. They throw them all into one big \ngroup. I do not. There are people out standing on the streets who just \nwant to be heard, who finally just want things in America to change, \nfor America to fulfill her promise of equal justice under the law in \nevery area, in every community. They are peaceful. They are sometimes\n\n[[Page S2760]]\n\nloud and brash, but they are frustrated, and they want to be heard. \nThere is another group that breaks through the middle of those \nprotesters. These in this group smash windows, steal shoes and \nelectronics from stores, and spray paint and destroy public property \njust from their own anger.\n  I don\'t treat protesters and rioters the same, and I encourage people \nnot to treat all police officers the same. Are there some rioters mixed \nin with the protesters? Yes. Are there some police officers who need to \nbe confronted for their racial views? Yes. Is that all of them? By far, \nno. Every person should be judged by his own character--every person. \nWhen we as Americans lump groups together and say they are like that, \nwe have divided us even more.\n  It was 20 years ago when my State made it illegal for a police \nofficer to stop someone simply because of one\'s race. Most police \ndepartments in Oklahoma don\'t allow a choke hold. In fact, I spoke with \nofficers in the Oklahoma City Police Department who have been there for \na very long time who said they were never even trained to do that. They \nwere told not to do that. What has happened in other areas and other \nplaces has not happened in my State in the same way, but I still have \nfriends of mine who are African American who still catch me and tell me \nthe numbers of times they have been pulled over for driving while Black \nin places and neighborhoods in which I have never been pulled over but \nin which they have been multiple times.\n  We still have a long way to go. This legislative body can talk about \nit--we can share empathy, and we can listen--but we are also called to \nact.\n  So I bring to this body just a few ideas, some things we can do to \nengage, things like greater transparency. How can we oppose just \ngetting information out?\n  There are simple things that we are not currently doing, like \ngathering a Federal database on the use of lethal force by law \nenforcement. All of that data of whatever police department in whatever \nplace that uses lethal force should be collected and sent to a Federal \ndatabase so there can be a national tracking of where lethal force is \nused. What race is the police officer? What is the race of the person \non whom lethal force was used? What was the situation? How was the \ninvestigation handled? What was the result of that investigation? These \nare basic details.\n\n  City councils, city leaders, and city managers should not be afraid \nto look at the data and ask hard questions. We should not be afraid to \nlook at the data and ask hard questions.\n  Most every community has oversight boards that are citizen boards. \nGood. Are they empowered to actually engage? Are they involved in the \nhiring process? Are they involved in the oversight? Do they get a \nchance to look over their shoulders to evaluate what happens? Do they \nknow when there are reports on the same law enforcement officer over \nand over again? Are those advisory panels empowered?\n  Are there body cameras? It is not just if there are body cameras, but \nare they on? This has been our second challenge. Getting body cameras \nis just transparency. It is just the availability of information so \nthat law enforcement can see and so that citizens can see what is \nhappening. Law enforcement is in very, very difficult situations every \nsingle day. When law enforcement officers leave their homes each \nmorning, their families give them hugs and hope they come home that \nnight because, every day, they face challenges. I have great compassion \nfor those folks. Body cameras help everybody, for they provide clarity \nas to what is going on, but they are not effective if they are not on, \nand we have had several situations lately in which it seems, \nconveniently, body cameras have not been on. That is a problem, and it \nis an area we should address.\n  Mental health training is an area that has come up over and over \nagain and not just recently. This has come up for a long time. This \nbody--the Senate--and the House have passed and the President has \nsigned additional legislation dealing with mental health issues, but \nStates and local areas have to engage in this as well. Even in my own \nState, law enforcement is responsible for transporting an individual \nacross the State to a treatment facility for mental health or for \ntreatment for substance abuse. My State really does need to determine a \nbetter, more compassionate way to transport someone with mental illness \nor substance abuse rather than in the back seat of a police car.\n  We have to have a better, more compassionate way to do that. Every \ntime this occurs, law enforcement officers are taken off the streets \nfor an entire day because they are transporting someone when someone \nelse could have done that in a more compassionate, less obvious way \nthan in the back of a police car. We have to find a better way to do \nthat. Every time our law enforcement folks transition across the State, \nthey lose the time they could have used for training, for getting out \nof their cars to meet neighbors and hear stories, for earning trust, \nand for healing relationships.\n  Every city of any size across America has boards and commissions, but \nthose boards and commissions often have the same people who just \nshuffle around from the same boards and commissions. They get off one \nboard and move to another board. I find, just by asking around, that \nmany of those on boards and commissions do not match the diversity of \ntheir communities. They are groups of wealthy leaders or of activists \nwho are there, but they don\'t match the diversity, and the leadership \nof those boards and commissions certainly don\'t rotate enough to allow \nthe leaders of the boards and commissions that the cities use to have \ndiversity.\n  Every year from this House and Senate, we put out community \ndevelopment block grants. Why don\'t we just add to the community \ndevelopment block grants that cities and communities can get access to \nthese community development block grants and help improve their \nsituations if they also improve access and opportunity to individuals \nwithin the communities so they may also lead in those communities. If \nyour boards and commissions don\'t reflect the diversity of your \ncommunity, there is a problem with that city in the way it is actually \ndesigning the leadership structure of how decisions are made with \nFederal dollars. This is not a hard way to be able to raise up new \nleaders who will get their voices heard at city hall and get their \nvoices heard on how funds are actually used.\n  Oftentimes, big city police departments don\'t share the same racial \ndiversity of the city itself. Why don\'t we allow some of the grant \nmoney that we have that we already dedicate to law enforcement to be \ngiven to recruiters so they can recruit from the same diversity of \ntheir communities and actually help to pay the salaries of people who \nare stepping in during the earliest days in the police academy and as \nthey are starting into the force? That way, the diversity in our big \ncity police departments will also match the diversity of the \ncommunities themselves, and if they have a difficult time \nrecruiting, we will allow them to use those funds for recruiters.\n\n  You see, I really do believe there are things that we can do that \nwill make a practical difference, but I also firmly believe that racism \nis not a legislative issue--it is a heart issue, and it is a family \nissue. One of the biggest things we have is the bully pulpit to be able \nto challenge individuals and push back on individuals. Do, quite \nfrankly, whatever you can to push this. When I started 5 years ago, I \nwas asking people a simple question: Has your family ever invited \nanother family of another race into your home for dinner? It was just a \nsimple question.\n  I have been amazed at the number of people I have talked to in my \nState--people of all races--when I have asked them: Has your family \never invited another family of another race into your home for dinner, \nthey have responded back to me: I have friends of another race, to \nwhich I have always smiled at them and said: That is not what I asked. \nIt is not: Do you have friends of another race? Has your family ever \ninvited a family of another race to your home for a meal just for your \nkids to sit together and talk, just for your two families to sit and \nvisit like neighbors would do? I have been astounded at the number of \npeople whose thresholds of race are the thresholds of their own homes. \nWhy would that barrier be there, and how do we break that barrier?\n  A friend of mine raised an interesting question to me this past \nweekend. A\n\n[[Page S2761]]\n\ncouple of years ago, as a law enforcement officer, he slipped into the \nMuseum of African American History and found out that the Metro Police, \nwhich is here in the DC metro area, goes over to the Museum of African \nAmerican History and gets a guided tour through that facility to help \nnew police officers get an understanding of African-American history \nfrom a law enforcement perspective and see what has happened to the \nrelationship between law enforcement and African Americans over the \ncenturies.\n  He joined that tour, and his statement to me was, I wish every police \ndepartment could get that kind of training; that they could go to that \nmuseum and could get that kind of context.\n  My statement back to him was that we do that with the Holocaust \nMuseum.\n  The Holocaust Museum does tours and is currently designing a \ncurriculum by which to train trainers and work on anti-Semitism across \nthe entire country. This body helped to get that done. Why don\'t we do \nthat with the Museum of African American History and law enforcement? \nChallenge them to take the program they already have and turn it into a \ncurriculum. Train the trainers and then get that out across the entire \ncountry. Multiply that out. Why couldn\'t we do that?\n  Every year when Police Week occurs, why couldn\'t we have a large \ncontingency of law enforcement go through the Museum of African \nAmerican History, get that training there, and then take that training \nback home? Why couldn\'t that happen? It could if this body were willing \nto step up and do some pragmatic things--engage in actually finding \npractical ways to continue the work that our Nation is doing.\n  You see, we are not at the beginning with regard to race. We are four \ncenturies into this conversation. Yet what I will remind everyone is \nthat we are actually trying. There are many places in the world that \nare not working on race relations at all in their countries. If you are \nnot the dominant race, you are still excluded from the courts, from \neducation, from access. As a country, we are trying, but for those who \nthink we are done, they are wrong. We are not done with the journey.\n  I love pointing out to people: Watch the beginning of the Olympics \nwhen all of the countries march in. Almost every delegation under every \nflag looks alike until the United States marches in, and you see this \ngreat diversity of our athletes. It again reminds us that we are \ntrying, but the past 10 days should also remind us that we are not \ndone. Let\'s continue doing the hard work that needs to be done with our \nown families. Let\'s continue to do the legislative work that needs to \nbe done to make progress, but let\'s keep going until it is done.\n  My friend said to me last weekend that our founding documents are \ngreat founding documents. We have just never actually fully lived them \nout for everybody. I can\'t wait for us to continue the work in this \nbody toward becoming a more perfect Union.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan).

Res. 602, a resolution that we introduced together on \nJune 2, 2020, recognizing that the murder of George Floyd by officers \nof the Minneapolis Police Department is the result of pervasive and \nsystemic racism that cannot be dismantled without, among other things, \nproper redress in the courts. Senator Harris understands that law \nenforcement should not be completely shielded from accountability when \nthey violate someone\'s civil rights, and that the Supreme Court\'s \nqualified immunity doctrine is broken.

DWYER\n\n<bullet> Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, Mr. John Dwyer has \ndistinguishably served the U.S. Coast Guard and our Nation for more \nthan 43 years, on Active Duty, in the Coast Guard reserves, and as a \nlong-time Coast Guard civilian serving in Seattle, WA.\n  John earned his bachelor\'s degree from Gonzaga University in 1976 and \nwas selected shortly thereafter to attend Coast Guard Officer Candidate \nSchool. Upon his graduation in 1977, he was commissioned as an Active-\nDuty officer in the Coast Guard. In 1985, he transitioned to the Coast \nGuard reserves, where he continued to advance until retiring as a \ncaptain in 2005, while serving as the Pacific Area Reserve Chief of \nStaff. During this time, John also earned his master\'s degree from the \nUniversity of Washington, School of Marine Affairs, in 2004 and became \na Department of Homeland Security senior fellow. Concurrent with his \nReserve status, John began his service as a Coast Guard civilian \nemployee in 1986, allowing him to focus his expertise on the Puget \nSound region and serve as an invaluable source of knowledge and \ncontinuity for the rotating Coast Guard personnel. Ultimately, he \nadvanced to serve as the officer in charge, marine inspection and the \nchief of the Inspection Division at U.S. Coast Guard Sector Puget \nSound. In this important role, John was responsible for ensuring the \nsafety, environmental protection, and security standards for commercial \nvessels and waterfront facilities throughout Puget Sound, as well as \nthe navigable waters of Washington State and Montana.\n  Throughout his service while in uniform, John was repeatedly \nrecognized for actions that increased safety in the maritime industry. \nAs early as 1977, as a young lieutenant, John improved the safety of \nthe vital North Pacific maritime industry as he helped establish an \nuninspected vessel examination program in the Coast Guard\'s 17th \ndistrict. The processes he established were smoothly transitioned from \nthe district offices to a new field unit, the Marine Safety Office in \nAnchorage, AK. He was recognized in the early 1990s as commanding \nofficer of the Reserve unit in Tacoma, WA, where John systematically \nfound meaningful ways to increase reserve member participation in \nmarine safety inspections, which had traditionally been conducted by \nActive-Duty members. By enhancing the role for reservists in marine \ninspections, John improved the safety of people in the commercial \nfishing and maritime industries, while also boosting the efficiency of \nthe Coast Guard.\n  During his years of public service, John directly contributed to the \nmaritime safety and security of our Nation. John\'s direct oversight \nensured the seamless flow of maritime commerce, including the \ntransportation of almost 24 million passengers per year on the \nWashington State ferries, the largest ferry system in the United \nStates. He led the effort to create the region\'s first multiagency \nmaritime security team that was responsible for the security of the \nexpansive international maritime border between the United States and \nCanada. This successful program was adopted and became a best practice \nthroughout the Nation. John was also directly involved in ensuring the \nsafety of commercial fishing vessels in the North Pacific and Bering \nSea fisheries, worth more than $4 billion annually. His work with the \nfishing community undoubtedly saved lives and resulted in John becoming \nthe standard-bearer for fishing vessel safety to Coast Guard members, \nfishermen, and policymakers across the Nation.\n  Above his exemplary execution of Coast Guard mission requirements, \nJohn left his mark as a skilled and thoughtful mentor. John served as a \npatient teacher and remarkable mentor for thousands of Coast Guard \npersonnel. He generously shared his 43 years of maritime experience in \nvessel inspections, port security, waterfront\n\n[[Page S2762]]\n\nfacility inspections, mariner licensing, casualty investigations, and \nmarine disaster and firefighting response to train the next generation \nof leaders within the Coast Guard\'s Marine Safety program. His \nleadership and commitment to the professional development of others \nmade an incredible impact on more than 1,200 Coast Guard junior \nofficers and enlisted members, many of whom are now serving as \nexecutive level leaders in the Coast Guard and throughout the Federal \nGovernment. His mentees include a member of the Senior Executive \nService, three Coast Guard flag officers, 10 Coast Guard captains of \nthe Port, and several enlisted members who are now serving in \nsuccessful leadership roles in government and private industry.\n  During my time on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, I have had the benefit of working with a number of \nCoast Guard members that had been mentored by John. John trained them \nwell. Without a doubt, these members have left their mark on multiple \nCoast Guard authorization bills that have been signed into law with \nmeaningful improvements to maritime safety and environmental protection \nat the national level. I am personally grateful to have had the \nopportunity to work with so many members who were mentored by John, and \nI am sure that, after John retires, I will continue to learn from those \nhe influenced over his long career.\n  John also served as an influential leader within Puget Sound\'s \nmaritime community. In the wake of the tragedy of September 11th, he \nplayed a key role in Puget Sound as the Coast Guard implemented the \nMaritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. He served as the head of \nthe vessel security and Washington State ferries security sub-\ncommittees within the Puget Sound Maritime Security Committee and \nplayed a critical advisory role in Puget Sound\'s Harbor Safety \nCommittee. He was always available to provide advice on maritime topics \nand was frequently invited to speak at maritime events. In recognition \nof his tremendous impact, the Seattle Propeller Club named John as its \nPublic Official of the Year in 2013 and the Puget Sound Port Maritime \nCouncil recognized him as its Maritime Person of the Year in 2017.\n  John\'s actions and decisions were always in the best interest of the \npublic in which he selflessly and tirelessly served as he worked to \nensure the safety, security, and environmental protection of Washington \nState and the pristine waters of Puget Sound. He will be missed, but \nhis legacy of service and those he trained will live on. I thank John \nDwyer for his selfless service to the United States Coast Guard, the \nentire Pacific Northwest, and our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>'

PPP FOR CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS ACT






b'<html>\n<head>\n<title>Congressional Record, Volume 166 Issue 105 (Monday, June 8, 2020)</title>\n</head>\n<body><pre>\n[Congressional Record Volume 166, Number 105 (Monday, June 8, 2020)]\n[Senate]\n[Page S2764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [<a href="https://www.gpo.gov">www.gpo.gov</a>]\n\n\n                 PPP FOR CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nallow nonprofit critical access hospitals (as defined by the Centers \nfor Medicare & Medicaid Services) that are undergoing Chapter 11 \nbankruptcy reorganizations to apply for forgivable loans under the \nPaycheck Protection Program, if they are otherwise eligible. The \nlanguage of my bill, the ``PPP Critical Access Hospitals Act,\'\' mirrors \nlanguage originally introduced by Rep. Golden that was included in the \nHouse-passed ``HEROES Act.\'\'\n  While hospitals are not prohibited from participating in the PPP, \nthose that have previously or are currently under bankruptcy protection \nhave been unable to access PPP funds, due to an interpretation of \nunderlying Small Business Administration 7(a) program rules. While I \nrecognize the importance of protecting taxpayer investments in the SBA \n7(a) program, the PPP program, which I coauthored along with Senators \nRubio, Cardin, and Shaheen, is by design largely forgivable when used \nfor eligible expenditures.\n  The hospitals that would benefit from this bill are critical \ninfrastructure in the COVID-19 response effort, and many have \nexperienced substantial increases in expenses associated with preparing \nfor and responding to the pandemic. They simultaneously faced sharp \ndeclines in revenue associated with declining patient volumes due to \nthe cancellation of routine and elective procedures, in order to \nprotect public health and conserve limited supplies of Personal \nProtective Equipment, consistent with guidance from the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services.\n  While these entities are few in number, they are vitally important to \nthe communities they serve, both as frontline health care providers \nduring this public health emergency and as anchor institutions that \nprovide the paychecks and local economic stability that Congress \nintended the Paycheck Protection Program to preserve. These \ninstitutions need temporary financial assistance to weather sharp \nrevenue decreases that have resulted from Federal and State \ninstructions to cancel elective medical procedures as part of COVID-19 \nresponse preparedness. Expanding the PPP to include these key employers \nwill allow them to keep their doors open until they can resume normal \noperations once pandemic-related disruptions to their operations have \npassed.\n  Two institutions in Maine that would benefit from this bill are \nPenobscot Valley Hospital in Lincoln, and Calais Regional Hospital, in \nCalais. Both are in the midst of Chapter 11 proceedings, and both have \nsuffered serious revenue shortfalls due to the cancellation or scaling \nback of elective procedures during the pandemic.\n  The bill I am introducing today is carefully targeted to address a \nunique financial situation that frontline critical access hospitals \nface during this public health emergency. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>'
