Lisa\nMurkowski, Chairman of the Committee, presiding.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. LISA MURKOWSKI,\nU.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA\nThe Chairman. Good morning everyone, the Committee will\ncome to order. We are a few members shy this morning, including\nmy Ranking Member. As you know, we are in the beginning of a\nseries of votes this morning that just began at ten o'clock. So\nyou will see a little bit of disruption in addition to the\nhybrid look of today's hearing, but as we do here in the\nSenate, we improvise and we are flexible. My hope this morning\nis that we will be able to open the hearing and hear from our\nwitnesses before we get interrupted again for a second vote. We\nappreciate the flexibility of our witnesses and welcome each of\nyou.\nWe are here this morning to examine the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on users of our public lands, our national\nforests and our treasured national parks. Five months ago the\nnovel Coronavirus became a global pandemic, changing nearly\nevery aspect of life as we know it. Public health intervention\nmeasures were necessary to try to slow the spread of the virus,\nbut they have also impacted the use, the management and the\nenjoyment of our federal lands.\nSo let's start with our national parks. They normally\nattract more than 120 million visitors from March through July.\nIn a typical year, visitors spend $21 billion on travel,\nlodging, food and shopping inside our parks and in our\nneighboring gateway communities. Now obviously this is not a\nnormal year and the numbers certainly show it. Visitation is\ndown 22 percent in our national parks. Fewer visitors means\nless income and employment for rural tourism dependent on small\nbusinesses. The National Park Hospitality Association forecasts\na 46 percent decline in revenue for hundreds of park\nconcessionaires this year. I think we recognize that sadly some\nof these smaller businesses will not survive.\nI saw several examples of these impacts myself over the\nFourth of July recess when I was back home in Alaska. I had an\nopportunity to visit Denali National Park and Katmai National\nPark. On my way into Denali I stopped in the community of\nTalkeetna, just outside the park. This is a community that\nrelies very, very heavily on that summer tourism--those\ntourists who want to come up to see Denali but also those who\ngo climbing on the mountain, the entire climbing season was cut\noff this year. I was able to talk with the owner of a\nflightseeing company. They provide aviation services and\nspectacular flyovers of the mountain and ferry our hunters\naround during the fall season. Their situation is pretty dire\nright now. They were not able to receive a PSP loan. They are\nvery, very worried that they are not going to make it through\nthe end of the year. Normally they operate during this part of\nthe season. They operate upwards of 20 planes on any given day.\nThey only have three in circulation now. I mean, that is\nsignificant. If you only have three aircraft, that means you\nhave fewer pilots. You have fewer maintainers. It just trickles\nall throughout.\nAnd that business is not alone. I heard the same from other\nsmall businesses within the community. I visited a small\nboating company. They offer tours up the river. They were only\noperating two or three boats up the Talkeetna, again, at a time\nwhen they and their crews would just be going gangbusters at\nthis point in time. I stopped by the local brewery there in\nTalkeetna, one of the largest employers in that community. They\nhave seen a 60 percent decline in revenue. Then at Katmai, I\nhad an opportunity to speak with the concessionaires there at\nBrooks Lodge. They are providing only day services rather than\nthe overnight accommodations. They are going to be looking to\nsee if it is possible to adjust that for a very brief window,\nmaybe a month or so. But again, this is a lodge that normally\nwould be booked solid for months and months in advance. These\nbusinesses bear the burden of trying to bring in enough revenue\nto break even or just survive while also welcoming visitors and\nensuring safe, socially distancing operations. I was encouraged\nas I was in the parks to see almost everyone wearing masks.\nThey were adhering to the public health mandates, even in these\nvery, very remote areas.\nOutdoor recreation has also taken a big hit in our national\nforests. The outfitter and guide businesses that operate on\nthese lands are often seasonal, small mom and pop shops that\nreally rely on the visitor travel, and the loss of customers\nduring the peak season has just been devastating. And in\nspeaking with so many of them, they are looking at having to,\nagain, discontinue their services entirely. I think it is\nimportant, particularly in a place like Alaska where whether it\nis your national parks or your national forests and the\nvisitation, our visitation is May through the end of September.\nBeyond that, you just don't see people visiting in Katmai in\nNovember. You don't see people visiting as tourists in the\nTongass in February. It just doesn't happen. So for those who\nsay we just need to flatten this curve and get beyond it and\neverything is going to be okay, for our industry, for our\nsector here, it is gone. It is done for 2020. And they are\nworried whether they can survive through the beginning of the\nseason in 2021. This is very, very real and, of course, it is\nnot just for us in Alaska.\nI mentioned winter and whether or not we do see that level\nof tourism. We know that winter recreation did not escape COVID\neither. The 2019-2020 ski season was cut short, forcing every\nski area on our national forests to close early. As a skier, it\nwas devastating to me because we had such a great, epic ski\nyear in so many of our areas and we were not skiing.\nThe virus is also threatening the way our public lands are\nused to produce food and water. Dam and canal operators\ntypically finance large amounts of debt to build infrastructure\nthat transports water from watersheds in our national forests\nto cities and to farms, and family-owned ranchers carefully\nbudget for infrastructure and livestock purchases to ensure\nrangeland health and productivity under the terms of their\ngrazing permits. Some individuals are now struggling to pay\ntheir water bills and others are buying less meat. This exposes\nranchers, farmers and water providers to financial risks that\njeopardize their continued operation.\nImpacts on state governments are also having a ripple\neffect on federal land management. Many state habitat, wildlife\nand invasive species activities did not occur this spring or\nthis summer. Some states stopped all non-essential field work,\nincluding prescribed burns and forest restoration projects on\nneighboring federal lands. Others could not spawn fish in\nhatcheries which has reduced angling opportunities and could\npossibly compromise long-term aquatic species restoration\ngoals. In Alaska, we see a prime example of this. The sale of\nnon-resident hunting and fishing licenses accounts for a\nsubstantial portion of funding for our Department of Fish and\nGame. By some estimates, the Department could lose up to 60\npercent of its revenue stream because of this year's depressed\ntourism season. Without that revenue, the state is going to\nhave a hard time meeting the matching requirements for the\nPittman-Robertson grants or the stateside portion of the Land\nand Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). Here we are going to have a\ngreat opportunity for access to greater LWCF funds, but if the\nstate can't meet the matching, it is like we have not helped\nthem at all.\nToday we are going to hear testimony from several public\nland user advisor advocacy groups, and as we do it is important\nto consider the scale of the Federal Government's reach. It is\nthe single largest landowner in the United States, possessing\nmore than a quarter of all land within our borders, more than\n640 million acres in total. The vast majority of those acres\nare located in Alaska and across 11 Western states. COVID-19\nhas added a whole new layer of complexity to public land\nmanagement. We need to ensure the Federal Government is\nsupporting the users who are essential job creators and\nenvironmental stewards while also respecting the wishes of the\nlocal communities who call those areas home.\nWith that, I turn to my friend and colleague, Ranking\nMember Manchin, for your opening remarks.\nSTATEMENT OF HON. JOE MANCHIN III,\nU.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA\nSenator Manchin. Thank you, Chairman Murkowski, and I thank\nall of you for being here today and those, I think we have a\ncouple on the video and we appreciate your expertise too for\nsharing it with us.\nI would like to take a moment to acknowledge that we now\nhave 141,000 people who have died in the United States from\nthis horrendous virus including 102 West Virginians. Our heart\ngoes out to each one of their families and all those left\nbehind, and it is just a horrible, horrible, horrible, tragic\nevent.\nToday we are going to be discussing the COVID-19 impacts on\nusers of public lands. As the case with nearly every facet of\nour society, most users of public lands are continuing to\nexperience a disruption to business as usual due to the\nCoronavirus. I believe it is important for public lands to\nremain open, accessible, when it is safely possible to do so,\nnot only because they offer a wonderful respite and a way to\nenjoy our great outdoors, but also because they are important\ngenerators of economic activity, especially, and I mean\nespecially, for rural America and West Virginia is all rural.\nLast week I held a virtual feedback session with West Virginia\nleaders to hear directly from them about how we can better\nutilize and direct future COVID-19 funding. Precisely what I\nasked them, tell me what did not work for you in the first\nround of funding that was designed to work for you but did not.\nTell me what is the greatest need you have now. If we could\npinpoint just one thing, just give me one. And so, every\ncategory, we had over 43 different representations of all\ndifferent facets of life in West Virginia, and they all had\nsome great, great input to this. It has been very helpful.\nA major problem we are facing in West Virginia is getting\nCARES Act funding out the door to counties and local\ngovernments. Even the monies that the states have received,\n$1.25 billion to the smallest states and some of you are from\nstates like mine. The governors haven't put them out and put\nthe money out. Forty-five percent of that was intended. So if\nyou were a small state with $1.25 billion, $560 million was\nsupposed to, it wasn't in the law, but it was supposed to go to\nthe counties, municipalities, non-profits, every one of the\naspect to keep economies alive, anybody that got, basically,\nharmed because of COVID-19 which everything you're talking\nabout today and you're representing, got slammed. That money\nwas to be used to keep them whole or try to keep them above\nwater, so when a market does return. And I tell people, if you\nthink this market is going to return before there is a vaccine\nor an antibody, you are crazy. So people are still scared. We\nmust live with that fact until we get a vaccine. It is going to\nbe rough but if the money is not distributed, it makes it even\nrougher. So I hope all of you go back home, and start raising\ncane for your share because I can tell you, the national\naverage is 16 percent, only 16 percent of the money the\ngovernors have gotten has gone out to the local communities and\nbeen distributed around their states.\nI raise that point in relation to the conversation we are\nhaving here today because in many states those governments rely\non federal payment and revenue sharing programs from federal\nland management agencies to offset the loss of revenues due to\nthe presence of public lands in their jurisdictions. It\nincludes important programs like Secure Rural Schools, Payment\nin Lieu of Taxes, the Dingell-Johnson funds for fish\nrestoration and royalty payments for energy development. Each\nof these programs provide important lifelines to the states and\ncommunities all across the country that are experiencing\nunprecedented threats to their budgets due to the Coronavirus.\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention that we just passed the\nGreat American Outdoors Act, and that Great American Outdoors\nAct is going to do so much.\nI want to take the time to acknowledge David Brooks. He has\nbeen working on this Committee for 32 years. David and I were\ntalking and he said, ``I never thought this day would come.\nThis is the greatest achievement we have made in the last half\na century, 50 years or more, and I think all of us are going to\nbenefit by it.''\nI look forward to hearing from each one of you about your\nconcerns and challenges. I also hope we will be able to hear\nfrom the Department of the Interior and Forest Service in the\nnear future so that we can better understand their plans for\nreopening federal lands in a manner that protects the health\nand safety of public land visitors and agency employees,\nconsistent with federal and state health guidelines.\nI would like to take a moment and turn to some good news\nand that is, again, the Great American Outdoors Act, which we\nare very, very pleased about. It will be a major investment\nthat public land users in this great country will enjoy for\ngenerations to come, and I know my children and grandchildren\nwill enjoy it. The Great American Outdoors Act is going to\nprovide permanent and mandatory funding for Land and Water\nConservation Fund, at a fully authorized level of $900 million\nannually and $9.5 billion for deferred maintenance for projects\non federal lands with 70 percent of that amount dedicated to\nnational parks. Passage of the bill's historic achievement, I\nbelieve, everyone understands that is in this line of work and\neveryone who has ever enjoyed the outdoors. The fact that we\nwere able to get this bill through the Senate and the House in\na relatively short timeframe in the most toxic environment I\nhave ever lived through in my life, speaks volumes of the\nimportance of the great outdoors and the conservation and the\nenvironment that we are all responsible for.\nWith that, I want to thank Chair Murkowski for having this\nhearing, and I look forward to hearing from all of you and the\nwitnesses.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator Manchin.\nI think we are looking forward to having the President sign\nthe Great American Outdoors Act and, as you point out,\nfinalizing----\nSenator Manchin. Yes.\nThe Chairman. ----and ensuring that good work goes forward.\nWe are joined by a strong panel here this morning as we are\nlooking at the impacts of COVID-19 on our public lands. We are\ngoing to begin our panel this morning with a couple of\nwitnesses that are joining us virtually and three that are here\nin person.\nWe are going to start this morning with the Honorable Kelly\nHepler, who is the Secretary for the South Dakota Department of\nGame, Fish and Parks on behalf of the Association of the Fish\nand Wildlife Agencies (AFWA). I think it is important to also\nnote that in addition to his work in South Dakota, Mr. Hepler\nwas in the State of Alaska for about 35 years, as I understand,\nworking for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. So he is\nuniquely poised to speak, not only about Alaska's perspectives\nand operations but also where he is in South Dakota with their\nDepartment of Game, Fish and Parks. So we welcome Mr. Hepler to\nthe Committee.\nAlso virtually, we are joined by Mr. Douglas Kemper. Doug\nis the Executive Director for the Colorado Water Congress. We\nare pleased to have him.\nHere in the Committee room we have Mr. Ethan Lane, who is\nthe Vice President of Government Affairs for the National\nCattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA). We welcome you.\nWe are also joined by Mr. Will Shafroth. Will is the\nPresident and CEO of the National Park Foundation, so this is a\ngood day for you as well with passage of the Great American\nOutdoors Act.\nThen we are also pleased to welcome Ms. Jess Turner, who is\nthe Executive Director for the Outdoor Recreation Roundtable\n(ORR).\nWe will go in the order as I have introduced you. Again, my\nhope is that we will be able to get through the comments from\nall five of our witnesses this morning and then we might take a\nquick break to go vote. Hopefully we will and that will work\nwith our timing. I would ask folks to try to keep your comments\nto about five minutes. Your full statements will be\nincorporated as part of the record, and then we will have an\nopportunity for engagement back and forth. Several of our\ncolleagues will also be participating virtually, so there will\nbe a lot of moving pieces here but I think we have all got this\nin the age of Zoom and Webex.\nWith that, let's begin with you, Mr. Hepler. Welcome to the\nCommittee and nice to see you.\nSTATEMENT OF HON. KELLY R. HEPLER, SECRETARY, SOUTH\nDAKOTA DEPARTMENT OF GAME, FISH AND PARKS, ON\nBEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AGENCIES\nMr. Hepler. Good morning, Madam Chair and Ranking Member\nManchin, members of the Committee. I do appreciate this\nopportunity to testify this morning and I have testimony this\nmorning on behalf of the Association of Fish and Wildlife\nAgencies. As you noted, I'm Secretary of Game, Fish and Parks\nin South Dakota, but also as you noted, Madam Chair, that I\nspent 35 years in Alaska and those were great years. We do have\nsome mutual friends here--Mulder, Pat Carter and Rueben and\nothers. You also were very gracious and had an intern named\nMaggie Hepler a number of years ago. My wife and I certainly\nappreciate the leadership you showed with my daughter. Thank\nyou. But about five years ago I had the great opportunity to\nreturn back to my home State of South Dakota where I am now the\nSecretary.\nAs both Senators mentioned earlier this morning, we are\ncertainly in challenging times and this is truly an\nunderstatement. The effects of COVID-19 are profoundly\nimpacting the physical and mental well-being of our nation's\ncitizens and the stability of our national and local economies.\nDuring this pandemic, our natural resources which provide for\nthe health and well-being of the public are being relied on now\nmore and more. The general public has increased its use of\nstate-managed lands and waters at unprecedented levels for much\nneeded outdoor recreation and relaxation. Americans\nincreasingly are seeking nature on these state lands for\ncomfort and healing. This level of public use is presenting new\nopportunities to reach new constituents and driving home the\nrelevancy of state fish and wildlife agencies to a person's\nquality of life. As more people experience the proven health\nbenefits of the outdoors and nature, many of them engage in\nactivities that directly fund species and habitat conservation.\nHunting and fishing licenses, a lifeblood of state fish and\nwildlife agencies, depend on open lands, water and travel.\nLicense sales this year vary widely across the country.\nResident fishing licenses are by far the standout. Compared to\nlast year, national sales through April were just under about\nten percent across the land. In South Dakota we've seen a 27\npercent increase. Unfortunately this is coupled to an 18\npercent decrease nationally on non-resident fishing license\nsales due to state-specific travel restrictions and\nregulations. And in some states, agencies must sell up to six\ntimes the number of resident licenses to cover the loss of\nrevenue from non-resident license sales. Nowhere is this better\nillustrated, Madam Chair, than in Alaska where the Department\nof Fish and Game relies on non-resident license sales to fund a\nsignificant part of their budget. These sales are down 90\npercent and, I repeat, 90 percent in the first half of 2020\ncompared to April 2019. Excise taxes from sales of hunting and\nfishing equipment provide another bright spot for conservation\nand state fish and wildlife agency budgets. Estimated sales of\nguns and ammo have increased by about 300 percent in the second\nhalf of FY 2020. Revenue generated from these taxes fund\nconservation projects directly benefiting hunters and\nrecreational shooters. The sale of angling and gear and motor\nboat fuels and the resulting excise tax receipts have been\nrobust since part of the state supports fish projects.\nHowever, there's an unprecedented strain on state agency\nbudgets and fiscal uncertainty is the norm. Mandatory\nreductions in spending authority, hiring freezes, stringent\nspending shrinkages and reduction or elimination of state,\nfederal and general funds to state agencies are some of the\nfiscal challenges that they're now facing. Critical NGO\npartners also relied on for match generation have been\ndevastated by this economic impact and they've also been put at\nrisk--grants, contracts, cooperative agreements that we have\nwith these partners. And even though funding is performing\npretty well, none of us know for certain what's going to happen\nthis fall and what that means as far as our hunting licenses.\nCongress has recognized this increased necessity for\nconservation funding, and I thank the Senate for the passage of\nthe Great American Outdoors Act. Outstanding work, Senators.\nThis will create jobs by addressing the deferred maintenance\nbacklog to federal land managers as well as help fund the\nstatewide program's Land and Water Conservation Fund, that, of\ncourse, as Senator Manchin noted, this Act passed the House\nyesterday and congratulations to all. It's going to provide\nsome historic funding for many.\nIn South Dakota we partner with communities across the\nstate to improve the quality of life by funding projects like\nswimming pools, playgrounds and hiking trails. These are the\ntype of projects that keep small communities alive, although\nI'm concerned about the ability of these communities to build\nthat make them necessary to match. We will continue to rise and\nmeet the challenges of this pandemic and look forward to\nworking with the Congress to answer their needs. Indeed, state\nfish and wildlife agencies will be resilient, strong and\nensuring the wise stewardship of fish and wildlife resources\nfor the benefit of the current and future generations. We want\nto work with Congress to not only improve our financial\nsecurity to rebuild and our state recreational infrastructure,\nbut maybe it is important to bring hope to all those families\nthat value the importance of getting outside. Thank you again,\nMadam Chair, for the opportunity to testify, I stand by for\nquestions. Thank you, Madam.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Hepler follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Very good, thank you, Mr. Hepler. We\nappreciate that.\nMr. Kemper, welcome.\nSTATEMENT OF DOUGLAS KEMPER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COLORADO WATER\nCONGRESS\nMr. Kemper. Good morning. This is Doug Kemper. I am the\nExecutive Director of the Colorado Water Congress. It serves as\na principal voice of Colorado's water community. I'm also here\nrepresenting the National Water Resources Association. I serve\nas the Chair of the State Executives. Most Western states have\nan organization somewhat similar to ours, and collectively we\nrepresent the majority of water use in the Western United\nStates. Much of our water supply does come off of federal\nlands, parks and forests, and I'm here to talk a little bit\nabout how COVID is affecting the water community--to cover five\ndifferent topic areas. As we look at some of the COVID impacts,\nsome--many are yet to be fully felt. There's some unevenness of\nimpacts from place to place and type of water use but there is\na general concern about the delays and funding for aging water\ninfrastructure replacement.\nFirst, on the safety and health of employees, our staff\nthat work out in the field provide critical daily functions\nthat cannot be performed remotely and there's a need for better\npreparedness. Most of us did not have a COVID scenario in our\nbudgets as we were preparing for 2020. We do need stockpiles of\nPPE. We need some better messaging that water supply and water\nquality remain good and certainly, also, is stop flushing of\nflushable wipes has been a real problem for our wastewater\nfolks. We do need better training and cross-training of\noperators. We already have a shortage of water and wastewater\noperators.\nFrom infrastructure funding in my written materials there's\nbeing that they're from Idaho, that as commodity prices drop\nand the economy is falling, you know, construction costs are\ngoing up. This puts more pressure on local government's ability\nto fund and especially about concern of the ability to for\nstate and local match for costs. Farmers need help and they\nneed preparation. We need to invest in water infrastructure,\nand those investments return huge economic impacts. The\nirrigated ag needs to, in Western Colorado, really supports our\nlocal communities and it's very important. We need to,\naccording to ASCE, we've got an $84 billion gap in water and\nwastewater facility funding, $45 billion in aging, high hazard\ndams, $80 billion in levees.\nWe want to thank Senators Gardner and Bennett for their\nsupport for revenue stabilization assistance for Colorado. A\nrecent survey by Colorado Municipal League shows that 80\npercent of our municipalities expect a general fund shortfall\nof 20 percent in 2020. This is going to affect reducing\ncritical services, staffing and controlled maintenance. We're\nseeing a precipitous drop in natural resource production and\nseverance tax that comes from that. Sixty percent of that in\nColorado is used for rural communities for funding. We're\nseeing an 81 percent decline in Colorado of severance tax and\nwe've had, our state government has moved over $45 million from\nits funds to balance the general budget that would normally\nhave gone to water infrastructure funding. We're very concerned\nabout any work on shutoffs or federal mandates on shutoffs. I\nthink that most of our local water providers are doing an\nexcellent job of working with providers--with the customers to\nmitigate any kind of impacts there.\nWe've already mentioned the forest health, and that's a\nmajor concern. Aquatic nuisance species control, you know, we\nhad 9,000 boat decontaminations this year and had 50, through\nthis year, 5,200 from this time last year. And the forest to\nfaucets programs, the resilient forests and the water source\nprotection programs are all very important. Our special\ndistricts that were left out of the CARES Act and PPP programs\nneed some help. These are really important districts that\nprovide services where cities and counties cannot. You can look\nfor more work there coming from special districts on mitigation\nfor funding there.\nIn conclusion, the long-term plans are in flux really due\nto uncertainty of COVID, and that's really saying something for\na water community that's constantly buffeted by weather and\nchanges in the economy. Nobody's giving up. We generally have a\nvery positive attitude, but we do need the Federal Government\nas a partner. I want to thank all of our Western Senators for\ntheir help and, as we're kicking around ideas in the water\ncommunity, your names are all coming up very regularly and we\nreally thank you for your support.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Kemper follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Kemper. We appreciate that.\nWe will come back to the Committee room here and hear from\nMr. Ethan Lane. Welcome.\nSTATEMENT OF ETHAN L. LANE, VICE PRESIDENT OF GOVERNMENT\nAFFAIRS, NATIONAL CATTLEMEN'S BEEF ASSOCIATION\nMr. Lane. Thank you, Chair Murkowski for inviting me today.\nRanking Member Manchin, thank you as well. My name is Ethan\nLane. I am the Vice President of Government Affairs for the\nNational Cattlemen's Beef Association. NCBA is the oldest and\nlargest trade association representing the U.S. cattle and beef\nindustry. Formerly, I was the Executive Director of the Public\nLands Council which is the only organization that advocates\nsolely for the 22,000 grazing permit holders that operate on\nWestern federal lands in the United States.\nThe testimony I offer today I hope will address two\ndifferent issues. One, those issues germane to this Committee's\njurisdiction, but two, hopefully to present to you a larger\npicture of what Western ranchers are dealing with in the face\nand context of COVID-19 over the past few months. It has truly\nbeen a challenging environment for our industry.\nIn April of 2020 some of the leading economists in the\ncountry, specifically agricultural economists, found that the\neconomic impact to the U.S. cattle industry from COVID-19 was\nat $13.6 billion and climbing. According to producers who sold\ncattle throughout the spring, their payments that they received\nfor their live animals were something like 30 to 50 percent\nreduced from what they expected when they entered this season.\nFor cow/calf producers operating on Western grazing allotments,\nthis is perhaps even more exacerbated by the year-round nature\nof their businesses. That economic impact report estimated that\n$111 could be attributed as lost to each steer sold this year\nwith an escalating loss to $247 moving into 2021 without some\nmitigating assistance.\nThe brunt of this economic impact really stems from some of\nthe slowdowns that we saw in the processing sector. Obviously\nthat was a large story during the peak of COVID-19, but it led\nto a tremendous backup of cattle and livestock on Western\ngrazing lands and in the grazing industry, in general. Those\nproducers chose not to follow the path that we saw in some of\nthe other protein spaces by looking for options for\ndepopulation and, instead, looked for areas to augment feed\nsupplies, look for areas for additional forage and sustain\nthose cattle until they could be processed in a timely manner.\nThat strategy has proven successful, but we are now dealing\nwith some of the other impacts that have been discussed here\ntoday, especially for those producers that are operating in the\nWest.\nIn particular, speaking to the Chairman's comments when she\nopened this hearing, while there is a dramatic reduction in,\nmaybe, formulized attendance at some of those national park\nsites, there is a dramatically increased amount of public usage\nof some of those public lands, particularly surrounding large,\nmetropolitan areas. Our producers are seeing large surges of ad\nhoc usage of those lands which already before this pandemic\nwere quite popular with the American people. That is the point.\nThis is a multiple-use environment. That's something that our\nproducers hold very dear. They have managed in that environment\nfor sometimes as much as seven generations, but at the volumes\nthat we're seeing now, we are seeing some of those resources\nstretched beyond what they can really sustain. We're seeing\nwater sources that are used, not just by livestock but by\nwildlife as well, encircled by large SUVs, four-wheel drive\nvehicles and other resources while ignoring requests that those\nbe handled in a way that provides access for wildlife and\nlivestock to those water sources. We're seeing new trails being\nmade on an ad hoc basis by some of those off-road vehicles, by\nhikers, by others, without regard to the ecosystems that they\nare engaging in. And while we want to make sure that everybody\nenjoys those public lands and benefits from them equally, the\nregulatory environment that ranchers operate in basically means\nthat as they go home with a consequence-free experience on\ntheir public lands, the ranchers that are held to a very high\nstandard and constant scrutiny are left to deal with the\nramifications both from a land/health perspective and an\ninfrastructure cost perspective once that visit from the public\nis over.\nWe look forward to working with this Committee, with the\nDepartment of the Interior and USDA to try to find some ways to\nmanage those roadblocks that are in the way of our producers\ndoing the work that they need to do. As the rest of the economy\nshut down over the last four or five months, ranchers still\nshowed up for work every day. Ranchers still ensured that there\nwas beef at the center of American plates and they also ensured\nthat the 250 million acres that we help manage in partnership\nwith the Federal Government, continued to get that sustainable\noperational management that we have been providing for so long.\nSo we look forward to your questions. We look forward to the\ndiscussion and look forward to charting a path forward for\nhelping to manage these lands.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Lane follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Lane.\nMr. Shafroth, welcome to the Committee.\nSTATEMENT OF WILL SHAFROTH, PRESIDENT & CEO,\nNATIONAL PARK FOUNDATION\nMr. Shafroth. Thank you, Chair Murkowski and Ranking Member\nManchin, other members of the Committee who may be here\nvirtually, I'm Will Shafroth, President and CEO of the National\nPark Foundation, the official philanthropic partner of the\nNational Park Service. Today, five months into a global\npandemic, it remains difficult to gauge the full impact COVID-\n19 will have on those who work for, in or near our parks, as\nwell as the millions of Americans for whom national parks are\nan important destination. Especially in the throes of a global\npandemic, we must all work together to support the National\nPark Service's mission to ensure our parks remain accessible to\ncurrent and future generations.\nDuring the past five months the National Park Foundation\nhas done its best to adapt to the changing times caused by\nCOVID-19 by providing new and expanding existing support for\nparks. As the pandemic unfolded, the national parks suddenly\nbecame less accessible to most Americans. In response, the\nFoundation worked with the Park Service to develop new ways to\nbring parks to America's homes through digital experiences,\nenhanced virtual tours and webcams and auditory experiences\nlike PARKTRACKS have allowed people to tune into the sites and\nsounds of national parks from anywhere. On the Foundation\nwebsite we've added more content, including virtual Junior\nRanger booklets, instructions to earn a Girl Scout 19th\nAmendment badge and even a way to virtually explore Alexander\nHamilton's journey through our national parks once you watch\nthe musical. As in-person park visitation resumes, we must also\neducate visitors about some of the new norms. The Foundation is\nactively involved in the #RecreateResponsibly campaign which\nurges those who visit parks and other public lands to do so in\nthe safest possible manner. Some important messages that this\ncampaign is conveying include, ``Know Before You Go,'' ``Pack\nOut What You Pack In'' and be prepared with a mask, hand\nsanitizer, food and water.\nAs a part of our mission, the Foundation works to support\nnon-profit park partners and there are more than 450 of these\ngroups that generated an aggregate revenue of more than $1.2\nbillion in 2018. Revenue from these partner groups generally\nfalls into two categories: philanthropy and earned revenue. As\nparks closed to protect public health, groups reliant on earned\nrevenue began to face immediate challenges as funds to pay for\nsalaries and overhead dried up overnight. And even with the\nreopening of parks, business remains down and support for park\neducation efforts in some parks has diminished. On the\nphilanthropic side, most organizations continue to raise money\nfor parks, just not as much as before the pandemic. For\nexample, many organizations were forced to cancel large, in-\nperson fundraising events which can provide a meaningful share\nof a group's annual revenue.\nFurther, some donors shifted the focus of their giving to\nCOVID-related causes while others are in a wait and see posture\nuntil there's more certainty in the direction of the economy.\nTo support the park partner community during this unprecedented\ntime, the Foundation in partnership with the Friends Alliance,\nquickly moved to provide educational and technical assistance\nresources including hosting webinars for friends groups on\nnavigating the PPP loan process, sharing experiences across the\nFriends Community on what was working in fundraising and\nconvening park partners with NPS leadership to stay abreast of\nemerging issues and priorities for the Park Service. For its\npart, the National Park Foundation has stayed in the market, if\nyou will, with our fundraising efforts. We haven't stopped\nasking people for money, basically. And while donations from\nindividuals and foundations have remained fairly strong, our\nwork with some corporate partners, especially those that have\nbeen negatively impacted by COVID-19, has been put on, have\nbeen put on hold. And because national parks are deeply loved\nand a core part of the American DNA, I'm confident that those\nwho love our parks will continue to support them.\nAs most in the partner community struggle to thrive during\nthis challenging time, it's very exciting we also stand at the\nprecipice of the enactment of the Great American Outdoors Act.\nAnd I'd like to thank members of this Committee for your\nsupport and leadership as this historic legislation will\nprovide much needed funding for deferred maintenance in our\nnational parks. We at the Foundation and the partner community,\nin general, stand ready to help implement this once-in-a-\nlifetime legislation. With increased federal investment to\naddress the park's long overdue maintenance needs, the partner\ncommunity can continue to focus its efforts on funding\ninnovative projects that enhance the visitor experience and\nensure our parks reach their highest potential.\nI'd like to close with one parting thought. We're truly all\nin this together. For our parks to thrive, all of us in the\npark community need to work together--the Park Service, the\nNational Park Foundation, local and national partners and\ngateway communities. Congress has already taken really\nimportant steps for which we all in the community are grateful,\nand we look forward to continue to work with you to do even\nmore. Thank you for your time today, and I'll welcome your\nquestions.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Shafroth follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Shafroth.\nMs. Turner, welcome to the Committee.\nSTATEMENT OF JESSICA (WAHL) TURNER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, OUTDOOR\nRECREATION ROUNDTABLE\nMs. Turner. Thank you.\nDear Chairman Murkowski, Ranking Member Manchin and members\nof the Committee, thanks for having me here today to discuss\nthe many impacts COVID-19 is having on public land and water\nusers and especially the outdoor recreation business user\ncommunity who rely on these special places as the backbone of\nour economic force. ORR is the nation's leading coalition of\noutdoor recreation trade associations, totaling 32 national\nmembers, representing over 110,000 outdoor businesses and\ncovering the entire spectrum of outdoor recreation activities.\nPrior to the pandemic, we generated $778 billion annually,\ncomprised 2.2 percent of the U.S. GDP and supported 5.2 million\nAmerican jobs. At a time of unprecedented economic growth, we\ngrew faster than the entire economy in every single indicator,\nsurpassing other key sectors.\nHowever, our industry has dramatically changed this year.\nBecause of the COVID-19 outbreak and the ensuing efforts to\nmitigate the spread, including social distancing, travel\nrestrictions, caps on group sizes, retail and public lands\nclosures, outdoor businesses have gone through unprecedented\ndownturns and many are still in danger of going out of\nbusiness. Entire supply chains have been disrupted and, as the\nChairwoman mentioned, recreational businesses who provide\nseasonal opportunities and oftentimes rely on seasonal trips\nand travel should have seen a very busy spring and early summer\nand, instead, were shuttered along with the local, state and\nfederal land closures. Eighty-eight percent of our businesses\nsurveyed in May laid off or furloughed employees; 94 percent\nsaw a decrease in revenue; and astonishingly, all 23,000\nbusinesses surveyed were experiencing difficulty with\nproduction and distribution, with 79 percent experiencing\nsignificant impacts. According to the U.S. Census Bureau our\nindustry was the second most affected sector in the entire\ncountry, behind food and accommodation.\nWhile our businesses have been reeling from the economic\nshock and shifting to support PPE production and emergency\nresponse efforts, Americans' lives and communities have also\ndramatically changed. With schools, movie theaters, malls and\nmore temporarily closed, Americans are returning to the\noutdoors to provide a necessary reprieve from the intense\nmental and physical stress caused by the pandemic and the vital\nefforts to combat it. In past years less than 50 percent of\nAmericans have enjoyed an outdoor recreation experience, and\nyet a May survey found that 81 percent of Americans said they'd\nspent time outside during the pandemic and would continue to do\nso after. Metro areas measured park visitation increases\nranging from 6 to 145 percent. So similar to past recessions,\nAmericans are focusing on their priorities. People want to\nsafely get outside with their families where transmission rates\nof the virus are lower. There's no better place than in a park,\non a river, in a boat, camping in an RV, or on a hiking,\nbiking, off-roading trail to do this. Recent data reflects this\ndesire. So biking, fishing license sales in state, power\nsports, boat and RV sales have all rebounded since our last\nsurvey in May, and we're watching the demographics shift to\nyounger and first-time buyers.\nWe've proved to be a resilient industry, but we are not in\nthe clear yet. With more people heading outside and the\novercrowding of some federal sites, we must also focus on the\ncommunities who could not access the outdoors in a time when\nthey needed it most. As governors restricted travel and\nencouraged residents to use local communities for walks and\nexercise, more than 100 million Americans were not within ten\nminutes of a park or a green space and parks that were\naccessible to them that serve a majority of people of color,\naverage half the size and serve more than five times as many\npeople per acre than those that serve white communities.\nWith rising unemployment and these access and\ninfrastructure issues exacerbated by the pandemic, the entire\nrecreation industry thanks you sincerely for the Great American\nOutdoors Act which will help build urban parks, make recreation\nsafer and more sustainable and, of course, support rural\neconomies and jobs. There's never been a better time to\nconsider a recreation package to ensure that our Federal\nGovernment is investing in places and tools that can revitalize\nnot just our economy but also our spirit. Through policies like\nthe Recreation Not Red Tape Act, for equitable and sustainable\naccess, the SOAR Act for flexibility of permits for struggling\nguides and outfitters, ski fee retention and fee waivers to\nsupport seasonal businesses and an expansion on this\nCommittee's great conservation core work to get more youth and\nveterans back to work in the outdoors and recreational trails\nprograms full funding so that the full amount of fuel taxes\nthat motorize vehicle users pay goes to the improved access for\nall recreation users.\nSupport for resilient lands and waters and these policies\nmentioned will invigorate this once vibrant and now struggling\nindustry so we can help America recover from this economic\nrecession and get back to doing what our industry does best--\nstimulate local economies, put people back to work and support\nall Americans in their pursuit of an outdoor experience. Thank\nyou.\n[The prepared statement of Ms. Turner follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Ms. Turner. I appreciate what\nyou've added in terms of some of the legislative proposals that\nare out there that we might be able to help advance in\nresponse. I also want to acknowledge your comments about the\novercrowding. I think it is good, as we, every day try to find\nthe bright linings of COVID-19. Some days it is more\nchallenging than others, but we have seen families go outdoors\nand recreate at levels and in places that they have not before,\nand I think that is such an extraordinary positive.\nThe other observation that I would make is that the users\nthat I have come in contact with--users of our parks, users of\nour public lands--have recognized that in order to use and use\nsafely, we are accepting certain limitations that perhaps we\nmight not have been so eager or willing to do. The example that\nI might share with fellow Committee members, as I mentioned, I\nwas in Katmai National Park. Brooks Camp is where they have the\ninfamous bear cams where you have the big, lumbering bears\nstanding at the falls and waiting for the fish to come into\ntheir mouth and that is the most highly sought place to park\nyour family, watch the bears for hours on end, photograph some\nextraordinary pictures. If you want to look at my pictures, I\nhave got some really good ones. But people recognizing that\nthey can't all go down to the viewing platform at the same\ntime. A willingness to not only wait until it is their turn but\nrecognizing that you can't get on the lower platform until\npeople have cycled off, that there was a 20 minute, 30 minute\nlimitation and not once did I hear somebody say, no, I paid an\nextraordinary amount of money to come out here to view this and\nit is my right to stand here. There was a recognition that we\nwant to accommodate others. That, to me, was encouraging. I\nknow we don't hear all the times, the good stories, but I think\nit is important to note that as we are trying to access our\npublic areas that are very special to us, that we are making\nsome accommodations and making some things work here.\nI wanted to ask a question to you, probably Mr. Hepler and\nMr. Shafroth, and this is the issue of the fees and a\nrecognition that our states, I mentioned the impact on Alaska\nand Mr. Hepler you acknowledged that we are going to be down 90\npercent in terms of those revenues that we count on. I raised\nthat in my opening statement as well. Senator Manchin had said\nthat he had a roundtable where he was asking, okay, what is it\nthat we need to do, what didn't we do in CARES and what might\nwe need to be doing going forward? What sort of relief could\nCongress provide to address the concerns about the non-federal\nmatching requirements in the short- and the medium-term?\nI will turn to you, Mr. Hepler, first and then we will go\nto you, Mr. Shafroth.\nGo ahead, Kelly.\nMr. Hepler. Thank you, Madam Chair, I appreciate that.\nYeah, I spent five years as Director of Traditional Sport\nFishing. It's a real challenge right now Dave and Doug have to\ndeal with. It's, at the very least, what we're asking for,\nMadam Chair and Senators, is that right now it's required, it's\n75/25. So you need to probably have $25 compared from $75\ncoming from the federal side. We'd like to have that down to a\n90/10 and realizing this isn't asking for more money, this is\nall pass-through money and hope that's really the states. And\nso we're asking for a 90/10 relief for at least the next two\nyears and that will give people, like Director Russ in Alaska,\na chance to rebound a little bit because I'm definitely\nconcerned about that division because I'm not quite sure how\nthey're going to survive. I also agree with you just because we\nmay get a vaccine in January does not mean we're going to see\nthe same people who get in all those cruise ships coming back\nto Alaska to visiting some of the other states.\nSo that right there would at least be a step in the right\ndirection and we do have some other things we'd like to add but\ndirectly to your question, Madam Chair, that should help.\nThe Chairman. Good, I appreciate that.\nMr. Shafroth.\nMr. Shafroth. Yes, thank you, Madam Chairman. It's an\ninteresting dilemma because we've advocated strongly for the\nCentennial Challenge funds because frankly donors that we're\nseeking funding from like the fact that we're bringing federal\nmoney to the table and it inspires more contributions. And as I\nindicated in my testimony, the impact of COVID-19 has been\nuneven across the country. Some of the smaller groups have been\ndramatically impacted while some of the larger, more\nsophisticated groups, including ours, you know, we've kind of\nfigured things out in a way. And so, I guess I would advocate\nfor things like the Centennial Challenge funds, some additional\nflexibility for the Park Service to look on a case-by-case\nbasis because some groups, the Golden Gate Parks Conservancy,\nthey may well be able to easily meet the matching requirements\nwhere others are going to have a much more difficult time.\nI'm not that familiar with some of the heritage areas,\nMadam Chair, but I understand that they have some specific\nchallenges that may also require some additional flexibility.\nThe Chairman. I appreciate that.\nOkay, my time has expired. I am going to vote. Senator\nManchin is going to be coming back, but he is not back yet so\nthat means that we will go to you, Senator Heinrich, and then\nyou, Senator Barrasso.\nSenator Heinrich [presiding]. Thank you, Chairman.\nI want to ask a couple of questions that will largely focus\non education, and they are really for any of you. One of the\nthings that has been a challenge is that we have a whole\ncoterie of people who are coming and using our public lands\nthat maybe did not do that a year ago. One of the challenges\nthat ensues from that is that a large number of people are\ncrowding into the front country in places where you have trails\nthat may be narrow, and it is hard to socially distance and\nthen we have millions of acres that are literally, practically,\nreceiving no visitation at all. You know, when we were under\nthe most stringent lockdown and we had, I'm trying to think, I\nthink it was the blood moon, we had a really amazing full moon\nin New Mexico in the middle of that. I took my family out to a\nplace on BLM land that I knew there would be literally no one\nelse there. There was no one else at the parking lot, and we\nspent the entire evening out there and did not see another\nsoul.\nHow do we do a better job educating people about where are\nthose places that they can go that are really quite\nspectacular, that may have a little bit less infrastructure but\ntry to spread the public out more given the millions of acres\nof public lands that we do have?\nMs. Turner. I'll start. Thank you for that question,\nSenator.\nYou know, we've actually talked a lot. This is another good\nidea for a recreation package about streamlining the data\ncollection within the federal agencies. They all have different\nmethodology. They come out at different times. We really need\nto know who's on the public lands and why are they there? So,\nfor example, if we knew what type of recreation they were\nparticipating in, we could better move people or recommend less\ncrowded public lands. If we don't know whether they're there to\nhike or fish, we can't necessarily say there's a better place\nto go. So we really encourage this Committee specifically to\nlook at streamlining the data collection and making that\navailable. You know, if you Google a CVS right now you can tell\nwhen the hot spot is, when will it be crowded. It's probably\ngoing to be crowded around five o'clock. I'm going to go at\nnoon.\nHow can we show the hot spots in public lands, because I\nknow there's a lot of users who don't want to be in a crowded\nplace, especially now? And so, I think data could help move\npeople around very well at this time, I think.\nSenator Heinrich. And we don't want them to be----\nMs. Turner. And we don't want them to be. The Recreate\nResponsibly campaign that Will mentioned is a great way to\neducate the user community. It's really on the American public\nright now to do the right thing when they're getting outside,\nand I think more information would help that.\nAnd then the last thing is on our end and probably Will's\nend too, and that's brand marketing campaigns. I think\nbusinesses can help bring to light places that are less used--\nthe people know less about in their marketing campaigns when\npeople are at point of sale, talking about camping maybe in a\nless used area.\nMr. Shafroth. Thank you, Senator Heinrich.\nYeah, the issue of--there's plenty of space but we have a\ntendency to cram a lot of people into small spaces. I think\nabout half of the national park visitation last year of 327\nmillion visits happened on 25 or 30 parks. So it's both. We\nneed to do a better job of dispersing visitation across the\nNational Park System, and we're doing that in part through our\nFind Your Park campaign which was really to drive more\nvisitation. And the joke among superintendents was ``yeah, find\na park, but find somebody else's park because mine's got too\nmany people in it right now'' and disperse them to some of the\nlesser known places. You know, there's literally almost 400 of\nthose places that are lesser known and really compelling, many\nof them have to do with history and culture, but nonetheless.\nYour state is a great example of, you know, a lot of people\nprobably cramming into a few of those places and the rest of\nthe state is pretty vacant. The other part is even within parks\nwe need to do a better job of dispersing visitation. So if you\ngo to Yosemite and you would visit Bridalveil Falls, yeah,\nthere's going to be a lot of people there, but if you go up to\nMary's Lake up in Towalame Meadows, there'll be almost nobody\nthere. So that is part of an education process that we need to\nhelp do.\nThe other thing, and I think the Park Service is thinking\nabout this too, which is, you know, timed entry. We need to be\nlooking more at using technology in a more intelligent way to\nensure that, you know, if you show up at a movie theater at\nseven o'clock on a Friday night, you don't necessarily expect\nto get a seat anymore, right, or a seat together with your\nfamily. We have to be thinking in the same way about our park\nvisitation, and if you want to be at a prime spot, you may have\nto reserve some of those places.\nSenator Heinrich. I don't have a lot of time left, so\nrather than jump into another question I will make a comment\nand just, it is really more of a thank you to all of the user\ngroups and industry groups who stepped in. You know, there was\na moment there where even in my State of New Mexico that's so\ndependent on outdoor recreation and our public lands, where\npeople were saying, I think, maybe we just need to shut these\nplaces down right now and we need to shut the roads and shut\nthe access and people stepped up and within 24 hours there was\nliterally a consistent communications campaign from elected\nleaders, from industry, from people like the new outdoor\nrecreation specialist in our Governor's administration, all\ntalking about, okay, we need these spaces right now, but here\nis how you access them responsibly. Here is how you are not a\nburden on someone locally, you are not a burden on other users\nand we are going to do this together responsibly. And in a\nculture where oftentimes for the last few decades we have\nreally been about me, me, me, it was very heartening to see\nthat and it was a great benefit for public health and also for\npeople's mental health to continue to be able to access those\nplaces but be respectful in how they did it.\nSenator Barrasso [presiding]. Well, I am really\nappreciative of this hearing, and I just want to talk a little\nbit first about the impacts of the Coronavirus pandemic on the\nusers of our public lands and our forests, our national parks\nbecause it is extremely important, certainly to my home State\nof Wyoming. Although the year to date visitation in state and\nnational parks is down in Wyoming, we have seen a substantial\nincrease in visitors over the last couple of months as we\nreopened smartly, safely, sensibly, responsibly. Despite the\nrecent increase in visitors, tourism in gateway communities and\nconcessionaires in Wyoming truly are hurting. And you have seen\nthis all across the country. The ski resorts had to end their\nseasons early. Our parks had delayed openings.\nMs. Turner, in your testimony you highlight waiving fees on\npublic lands, extending contracts and permits as a\nrecommendation to put recreation businesses back on the\neconomic growth trajectory. And you know, as I understand the\nForest Service has deferred various fees in light of the\npandemic but they don't really have the statutory authority to\nforgive the fees. Could you talk a little bit how fee\nforgiveness and contract extension do provide relief for\nNational Park/Forest Service concessionaires and others related\nto the recreational business?\nMs. Turner. Sure, and thank you for the question, Senator.\nYou know, we do appreciate the Forest Service deferral.\nThat was a big deal when we needed it most. I think there might\nbe another coming down. But fee waivers actually help\nbusinesses provide certainty. We don't know how long we're\ngoing to be in this. We don't know what the revenue is coming\nin. Chairman Murkowski mentioned 30 percent to 50 percent of\nsome concessionaires. We know it's around that for some guides\nand outfitters as well. So this helps the guides and outfitters\nconcessionaires to keep people employed and keep their fixed\ncosts which haven't changed, if anything, they've gone up\nbecause of all of the new regulations they need to run their\ntrips. So rather than sending money and fee money back to the\ngovernment at an unknown cost, they're putting people to work\nwhich is important for communities like yours, rural\ncommunities in Wyoming.\nIt also helps create strong, resilient partnerships. I\nheard from the Forest Service yesterday. They said if a number\nof these businesses go out of business it would be unimaginable\nthe impact. These are really the people that are helping\nAmericans experience public lands and waters when they get to\nthe important parks.\nAnd then lastly, you know, for permit extensions, when\nfolks bid on permits, they're given a certain amount of time to\nrecoup that economic toll that they're putting in at the\nbeginning. And so, not knowing how they're going to run a\nbusiness, how they're going to open or when they're going to\nopen can be a huge upfront cost and one that they can't carry\nmuch longer.\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you.\nMr. Lane, in your testimony you noted that economists\nestimate the COVID-related impacts to the cattle industry, beef\nindustry, of more than $13 billion. As you mentioned, about 40\npercent of Western cattle herd and 50 percent of the nation's\nsheep herd spent at least part of their production cycle on\npublic lands. We certainly know about it in Wyoming. This\nstatistic isn't lost on any of us considering about half of the\nland in my home State of Wyoming, public land, 17 million\nacres, public land used for livestock grazing as this pandemic\nand resulting slowdown of meat processing has backed up the\nsupply chain for cattle and sheep. Is there a need for the BLM\nand the Forest Service to allow producers to keep their animals\non the range for a longer period of time where forage is\navailable and have the agencies allow some of this flexibility\nthat we think is important?\nMr. Lane. So I think the key there is flexibility and being\nable to really look at what the conditions are in an area where\nwe're talking about that need. You know, we are seeing that\nprocessing capacity rebound. We are making gains there, but\nproducers are looking for where they can find additional forage\nto keep those cattle in a holding pattern and a lot of places\nin the West, especially if they had a rainy spring, might be\npulling cattle off according to their terms of their grazing\nallotment at five percent utilization. And so we're talking\nabout not just the fact that we're not using all the resources\navailable, but perhaps really increasing fire risk as well. So,\nyou know, if we can get down to a really local level of\nanalyzing whether there's value in extending some of those\nterms, I think we can make some decisions that are best for the\nrangeland health and provide some flexibility to those\npermittees as well.\nSenator Barrasso. Great, thank you.\nBack to Ms. Turner, among the many lessons we learned, the\npandemic has highlighted the need for increased communication\nbetween various federal agencies and with Wyoming being in both\nthe Rocky Mountain and the Intermountain regions of the Forest\nService, we are no stranger to the importance of this\ncommunication. We have a case in point, a woman from Wyoming\ncontacted our office because the bathrooms in fish cleaning\nstations on the Wyoming side of Flaming Gorge were not open,\nbut just across the state line in the same park in Utah, the\nsame facilities were open. We were told that the high traffic\nfacilities are closed because of COVID-19 and their policy.\nHave you heard of similar instances? Is this just unique where\nthe pandemic has highlighted additional needs for effective\ncommunication in state, local and national levels?\nMs. Turner. Yup, thank you for the question.\nWe've heard that and we've been talking and dealing with\nthat, I think, for decades just on more communication between\nthe agencies both within the agencies and between the agencies.\nWe appreciate that the Forest Service allowed for local\ndecision-making to keep units open because that kept a lot of\nrecreation open, but we certainly are having the same issues\nwith businesses, oftentimes, as we've talked about guides and\noutfitters actually cross jurisdictional boundaries between\nforests or between agencies. So if one is open and the other\nisn't and if we look at closures happening again, that could be\nvery difficult to run a business.\nSenator Barrasso. Well, thank you.\nThank you, Madam Chairman, for holding this important\nhearing.\nThe Chairman [presiding]. Thank you, Senator.\nSenator Manchin.\nSenator Manchin. Thank you very much. All of this has been\nenlightening. I appreciate it very much, but I am going to ask\none question to everybody.\nWhat is the one thing that Congress, the Senate, all of us\ncould do that would help turn around and basically recover\nquicker? We will come out of this pandemic sooner or later, but\nwhat is the one thing we could do now to get us to that point\nwhen we come out of this that would help your industry? We have\ntwo of our witnesses on the video, if they would like to just\ngive me an idea of what they would think we need to do--one\nimportant thing as you think about this.\nMr. Hepler. Senator Manchin, this is Kelly Hepler and what\nI'd really love to see the Senate do is to invest in the state\ninfrastructure the same way you invested so wisely in the\nfederal infrastructure. It's going to immediately, I think,\nmake an impact on recreational use. I think it will help the\nindustry. It will certainly put boots on the ground, put money\nin small town USA. You know, we're talking, you know, hundreds\nof millions of dollars into what we need for investment.\nParticularly like in South Dakota we have miles of roads. We\nhave 80 dams, you know, which are important for recreational\nand home use, and so if you invest in that infrastructure with\nthat same zeal you did on the federal side, you'll see those\nsame results, maybe even amplified more. So, Senator, that's\nwhat I wish you'd do.\nSenator Manchin. Anybody else?\nMr. Kemper. Senator, this is Doug Kemper. I think the\nrevenue stabilization assistance, especially to utilities and\nhelp with the smaller special districts that have just not been\nable to get any help from the CARES Act would be most\nbeneficial.\nMr. Lane. Senator, I appreciate that question.\nThe biggest unused resource in the federal grazing arena is\nmaking grazing allotments that are subject to a never-ending\nNEPA backlog. There is a tremendous amount of forage available,\nnot to mention unrealized resource benefit if we can manage\nthose resources properly that are sitting on a shelf right now\nbecause we can't get the NEPA done or get over those NEPA\nhurdles to put those vacant allotments back into production.\nMr. Shafroth. Thank you, Senator.\nI would say be generous in your appropriations to programs\nlike the Centennial Challenge this year. When you were out of\nthe room, we talked about having some initial flexibility there\nbut those dollars will stimulate more activity from the 450\norganizations that are out supporting parks than almost\nanything that you can do.\nMs. Turner. I would have said the Great American Outdoors\nAct, but I checked that off yesterday. So I appreciate that.\n[Laughter.]\nI think a recreation package with some of the provisions\nthat I outlined so that we have better management and tools for\nour recreation businesses.\nSenator Manchin. I was in West Virginia last week, the last\ntwo weeks we were off, and then we had a virtual town hall,\nvirtual listening session to hear all the people's concerns.\nThe number one thing in my state from infrastructure is\ninternet connectivity. Internet connectivity lets people stay\nlonger and now basically they can work from anywhere, because\nof telework and that could continue on. It could be a new fad.\nI think the new normal is not going to be the old normal we\nknew. It has changed everything.\nBut connectivity, if we, all of us, Democrats and\nRepublicans, work for one thing and especially in our rural\nstates. I don't need to tell my Chairman here, my friend, Lisa,\nthat this is something we are challenged with. I have kids that\ncan't do homework, but I have other people coming in to ride\nthe Hatfield-McCoy Trail that will stay in the cabins. They\nstay an extra two weeks. I have people that would stay in some\nof our beautiful parks out in West Virginia that would stay all\nsummer if they could and it is just something we need. So I\nwould speak to that.\nOne other thing I wanted to speak to, and this is directed\nto Mr. Shafroth. The question for the Park Service is, are\nthere enough shovel-ready projects that we can do? I mean, we\nare going to have $1.3 billion a year.\nMr. Shafroth. Right.\nSenator Manchin. A lot of it is for backlog maintenance\ntoo, but it is going to be for some new projects that have an\nopportunity to really enhance the quality of that park. Are\nthere programs that they have been working on and, kind of,\njust been piecemealing it for lack of funds?\nMr. Shafroth. Thank you, Senator, and it probably wouldn't\nbe appropriate for me to answer for the Park Service because\nthat's a very complicated, multiple-answer question.\nSenator Manchin. Sure, I understand that, yes.\nMr. Shafroth. But that said, I am aware, having spent a lot\nof time with the Park Service leadership on this point, is that\nthere are a number of projects that are----\nSenator Manchin. As a foundation you are all looking. You\nare watching things all the time anyway.\n[Laughter.]\nMr. Shafroth. I know that they have their important\nprojects like the Grand Canyon water line that are ready to go,\nthat are wanting for funding otherwise and I gather that\nthey've got a number of projects, especially for the first year\nor so. I don't think they necessarily wanted to have five\nyears' worth of projects ready to go until the bill passed. So\nI think, you know, given it's going to take a little while for\nthe money to actually become available----\nSenator Manchin. Yes.\nMr. Shafroth. ----that they are working on that.\nSenator Manchin. Well, let me tell you what I would be\nlooking for and I think all of us would like to have some\ndirection from--projects that have started that have been very\nslow-paced because of a lack of funding. They just couldn't,\nyou know, they continue at a snail's pace.\nMr. Shafroth. Right.\nSenator Manchin. Those projects could come to completion\nfairly quick because they are on the move. They are moving\nthrough the process. That is what we really need to know. We\nneed to get an accounting of that. Maybe we can request that,\nMadam Chairman, from the Parks to find out what projects have\nbeen in place and basically have been slowed down because of\nlack of funding. Those are the ones we could pick up and\nfinish.\nThank you all very much for being here.\nThe Chairman. Senator Manchin, we can work with you on\nthat, that Parks list, from the appropriations perspective as\nwell. But I do have an offer for you. I have got a project for\nyou to look at, at Denali National Park. I have pictures that I\nwill tease this up, but yes, we have some work to do within our\nParks and that is, again, why we are looking forward to the\npassage of the Great American Outdoors Act. Thank you for your\nleadership on that and for yours, Senator Daines.\nCongratulations as well.\nSenator Daines. Well, thank you, Chair Murkowski. It was a\ngreat vote last night in the United States House, and Senator\nManchin, it was north of 300 on the positives there. It was a\ngreat, strong, bipartisan vote.\nSenator Manchin. 310.\nSenator Daines. 310, yes, that is great.\nWell, thank you for testifying today on the pandemic's\nimpact on the users of public land. This hearing is timely as\njust last night the U.S. House passed the Great American\nOutdoors Act which will greatly benefit the users of our public\nlands. It is also timely as Congressional leadership and the\nAdministration are now busy negotiating the scope of the next\nCOVID package. And for perspective, the outdoor recreation\nindustry which supports over 70,000 direct jobs in Montana has\nbeen devastated by this pandemic which coincides with what is\ntypically our peak season.\nOutfitted tourism is down 60 percent and will continue to\ndecline as cancellations roll in during prime summer and fall\nseasons. In fact, over a two-day period there is a hunting\noutfitter out of Big Timber. I have spent a lot of days\nfishing, hunting north of Big Timber as a kid growing up in\nMontana. They experienced a $400,000 loss due to fall\ncancellations. There is another Montana outfitter who was\nforced to close their snowmobile business, and they face a 70\npercent decline in their hunting business. That is why I\nintroduced the Trail Stewardship for Economic Recovery Act\nwhich provides employment opportunities for struggling\noutfitters and guides through trail project contracts in our\nforests.\nMs. Turner, how does the Trail Stewardship for Economic\nRecovery Act benefit both small businesses, public land and\npublic access and how are outfitters and guides uniquely\nqualified to do this type of work?\nMs. Turner. Thank you for the bill, Senator, and the\nquestion.\nAs we've talked about a little bit here today, costs are\nup, trips are down and many guides and outfitters have lost a\nhuge percentage of the time already being closed for the early\nmonths. What some people don't understand is many of these\nsmall businesses are the bedrock of rural communities and\nthey've been shut for eight months and they have to recoup the,\nyou know, entire year's revenue from just a short season that's\nalready been shortened. So what this bill does is it helps keep\nFTEs on. It helps them bring their employees back to do\nimportant maintenance work on public lands and waters. It\ndevelops important partnerships with the federal agencies to do\nthe stewardship work and one of the biggest things is it will\nkeep these small businesses around for another season,\nhopefully many more seasons, so that they can really connect\nmore Americans to this great outdoor experience. What they\nprovide are safe and memorable experiences on our public lands\nand waters for the user community.\nIf you've been on a river trip, which I know you have, we\njust talked--on the Yellowstone, I think, fishing last week--\nyou know there's nobody that knows a river better than a river\nguide. So I have full confidence that the guides and outfitters\nthat know these lands, that have been working and running trips\nin these lands would be wonderful stewards for these projects\nand where they don't have expertise there's the core network,\nthere's trail builders. There's so many other groups that they\ncan rely on for some of that expertise.\nSenator Daines. Thank you.\nAnd you know, the double whammy here is they are refunding\ndollars of pre-booking so they had the cash sitting in their\nbank accounts and now they are refunding those dollars at the\nsame time cancellations going forward are rolling in as well.\nSo it is just, it is absolutely the worst storm possible which,\nas you know, is a relatively short season, oftentimes, in\nMontana for those who focus more on the summer months.\nAs I mentioned in my opening statement, the leadership is\ncurrently negotiating the scope of the next COVID package. You\nstated pretty clearly, Ms. Turner, but I am going to say it and\ngive you a chance to state it once more, why is it absolutely\nimperative that outfitters and guides are not left out of this\npackage?\nMs. Turner. One thing I haven't mentioned is actually\noutfitters and guides were left out of PPP. PPP did not work\nfor seasonal businesses. So when they needed it most, when they\nwere starting to turn up and ramp on for their season, April-\nMay, they couldn't get PPP based on the allotments and how they\nhad to measure the revenue. That has been changed by Treasury\nbut many of them have missed the window or have already applied\nfor a much lower PPP. So really what this is, is a stimulus\nthat many other businesses didn't get. They're going to get\nthis now through that bill.\nSenator Daines. Thank you. That was very clear.\nThe pandemic has coincided with the season typically\ndedicated to wildfire prevention efforts and has now bled into\nwildfire season. The need for socially-distanced vegetation\nmanagement and wildfire prevention sheds light on the\neffectiveness and utility of targeted public land grazing to\nreduce wildfire risk.\nMr. Lane, in your written testimony you spoke at length\nabout the effectiveness of targeted grazing to reduce wildfire\nrisks. What do you need from the agencies and from Congress to\nfully utilize and realize the benefits of targeted grazing to\nperform vegetation management?\nMr. Lane. We need the exact same kind of flexibility we\nwere just talking about with Senator Barrasso a minute ago. We\nneed the agencies to recognize when there is more forage\navailable, they need to be flexible to allow those producers to\nstay out longer to go into those areas where we need to reduce\nfuel loads across a large area in the same way that they\ndynamically react and reduce our access to those areas when\nthere is not enough forage available. We need that to move both\ndirections, not just for land health but to ensure that we are\nmanaging those fuel loads in a comprehensive way. We've learned\nfuel breaks work where they work, but they don't work\neverywhere and we need that larger scale lowering of those fuel\nloads. And that's something that the grazing, sort of uniquely,\nis positioned to do.\nSenator Daines. Thank you. I am going to squeeze in one\nmore question, Mr. Shafroth.\nYou know the National Parks and the gateway communities\nhave suffered a major blow due to COVID-19 and, to add insult\nto injury, we just had a horrible fire in downtown Gardiner,\nMontana. We lost several businesses to a fire that was\naccidental. It happened during the afternoon and was yet\nanother blow. How can Congress, the National Park Service and\ngroups like yours work together to bolster our parks and the\ngood paying jobs that go along with them?\nMr. Shafroth. Well, I think it's in, sort of, Senator,\nthank you for the question, every place is a little different,\nfrankly. I mean, I think I was aware of the fire in Gardiner\nand the tragedy that ensued, but I think we have to work\ntogether to find ways to create a seamless experience in a lot\nof ways for people to come. So if you're going to drive 500\nmiles to go to your park, you need to know that you can get\ninto the park, that there are outfitters and other\nconcessionaires that can help you provide an experience, that\nthere's educational opportunities for your kids. And so, I\nthink that requires a new level of cooperation and\ncollaboration between and among all the different entities,\npublic and private and non-profit in order to make that happen.\nSenator Daines. Alright, thank you.\nThank you, Chairman Murkowski.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator Daines.\nSenator King is with us virtually. Senator King.\nSenator King. Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to thank you\nespecially for having this important hearing. I think this is a\ngreat topic for us to be discussing. I don't have much in the\nway of specific questions, but first I want to say, I don't\nthink we celebrate enough when we have a success. We always\nfocus on the next problem coming down the street. And\nyesterday's passage of the Great American Outdoors Act, I\nthink, is a really significant achievement for this Congress.\nIt is one that, to say it has been a long time coming, is an\nunderstatement and it is going to really make a difference for\ngenerations of Americans. Generations of Americans who won't\nknow any of us who passed it, but they will see the handiwork\nthat we brought through some hard work and cooperation and\nbipartisanship, all the things that our citizens hope we do.\nAgain, I don't really have a question. I do want to\nassociate myself with the comments from Senator Manchin about\nbroadband. We have learned a lot of lessons from the pandemic.\nWe knew before the pandemic that broadband was an issue in\nrural areas, but since the onset of the pandemic we have\nrealized it is not just an issue, it is a necessity. It is\nsomething that really has to be addressed in a comprehensive\nway just as Franklin D. Roosevelt addressed the rural\nelectrification question in the '30s. It is exactly similar. It\nis absolutely critical to modern life. I just want to thank all\nof our witnesses for the work that they are doing and have\ndone. I think it is prudent to try to get some provisions into\nthe new COVID bill that is being discussed to deal with some of\nthe specialized, particularly of seasonal businesses that have\nbeen particularly hard hit this summer. I know that is true in\nMaine as well as across the country.\nSo thank you for the hearing. I have enjoyed listening to\nthe testimony, and we will look forward to working with you and\nRanking Member Manchin and the rest of the members of the\nCommittee to try to effectuate some of the ideas we have heard\ntoday. Thank you again, Madam Chair.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator King.\nLet's next turn to Senator Hirono.\nSenator Hirono. Thank you, Madam Chair.\nI just wanted to make a comment regarding Jess Turner's\ncomments/testimony. In your testimony you note the importance\nof expanding the core opportunities to employ young Americans\nand veterans to work on public lands as we recover from the\npandemic. I just wanted to comment that when the Senate\nconsidered the Great American Outdoors Act, I introduced an\namendment to clarify that deferred maintenance projects using\npublic-private partnerships include organizations with\nqualified youth and conservation corps. While that amendment\ndid not get adopted, I will be following up with DOI and USDA\nto make sure that these organizations are not overlooked for\nthese projects, because I agree with you that these job\nopportunities are going to be critical to provide for our\npublic lands while getting Americans back to work. I have met\nwith a number of American Corps young people, and they are very\neager to be of help. So thank you, Ms. Turner.\nFor Mr. Shafroth, you note in your testimony that the\nNational Park Foundation hosted webinars to their partners on\nnavigating the PPP loan process. Do you have a sense of how\nmany representative park partners were able to obtain PPP\nloans?\nMr. Shafroth. Thank you, Senator Hirono.\nI don't have a number, but I know many of them did. We\nactually, you know, we hosted a webinar and a national law\nfirm, Arnold and Porter, offered to provide pro bono assistance\nto any of the friends' groups that wanted help in their\nnavigation of that process. But why don't I plan to follow up\nwith the Committee to give you some specific information about\nwhich organizations ultimately applied?\nAnd Senator, I'll also say that we agree with you on the\nconservation corps issue. We're very actively involved in\nsupporting the deployment of conservation corps throughout the\nNational Park System. And so we too will work with you to find\nways to ensure that the funds from Great American Outdoors Act\nand other places can be made available to the use of corps to\nexecute those projects.\nSenator Hirono. Thank you. I think if we can all come\ntogether on supporting the kind of work by the corps then I\nthink we can get it done.\nSo again, from you, Mr. Shafroth. With regard to the\npatchwork of various state and local mandates on public health\nand safety as it relates to the pandemic, I want to briefly\ntouch on reopening. Have you heard any concerns from partners\nabout their ability to ensure employee safety, such as\nrequiring the use of masks as parks reopen, and do you feel\nthat the protections put in place for the National Park Service\nfor reopening are sufficient?\nMr. Shafroth. Thank you, Senator Hirono.\nYou know, one of the things that we're trying to do with\nour promotion of the Recreate Responsibly campaign is to ensure\nthat all visitors have a strong understanding of the need to in\na way to behave differently than we have before. I think\nSenator Heinrich was the one that said it earlier before you\nwere on the phone, I think, that he described how people have\nreally stepped in to a moment really to be more sensitive and\naware of others. I don't know, my understanding, Senator, is\nthat the Park Service decisions about social distancing and\nwearing a mask is something that is on a park-by-park basis. So\nit's difficult to say uniformly whether or not every park is,\nyou know, doing things at a point where they could or should\nbe. I do know that many of the local partner, friends'\norganizations are adhering to the local guidance from the\ngovernors and health offices.\nSo again, if we can collect some additional information,\nwe're happy to get that for you.\nSenator Hirono. Don't you think that we should have, kind\nof, a standard set of requirements for a park reopening other\nthan the patchwork that we are experiencing?\nMr. Shafroth. Well, that's certainly an option. One of the\nthings that you may not know about us is we don't really get\ninto the policies of the Park Service and telling them what to\ndo and how to do it. We're there to support them to help them\nexecute their goals and their projects and programs, but again,\nif there's something we can do to gather some more information\nfor you to help you better understand what's going on, we're\nhappy to do that.\nSenator Hirono. Again for Mr. Shafroth. Does the Foundation\nhave any plans or strategies to use funds to help smooth out\nthe differences of where some parks are experiencing 60 percent\ndrop and then there are others--it is a whole range of changes\nthat have happened. So do you have any plans to use funds to\nhelp smooth out the differences between parks across the\ncountry?\nMr. Shafroth. Senator, thank you for the question.\nWe discussed that a little bit with Senator Heinrich\nearlier, but yes, I think one of the big challenges we have\nright now is in dispersing visitation both within parks that\nhave high visitation as well as across the National Park\nSystem. We have 419 national park units, more than half of that\nis at about 30% of our parks. And so, we must do better using,\nthrough the use of technology, I think. Imagine a Waze app that\nyou could have in a, when you go into a park to understand the\ndensity of visitors in certain parts of the park versus other\nparts of the park. Would it help inform where you went and what\ntime of day you went, et cetera?\nSimilarly, you know, we need to--we have something called\nour Lesser Known Parks program which helps visitors, potential\nvisitors to parks, understand some of the lesser known places.\nEverybody knows about Yosemite and Yellowstone, Grand Teton,\nDenali and Acadia, et cetera, but very few people know at this\npoint even about White Sands National Park and the literally\nhundreds of historical and cultural sites around the Park\nSystem. So we're very actively involved in drawing more\nattention to those places and hopefully drawing more visitors\nto them.\nSenator Hirono. Thank you very much. Thank you, and thanks\nto the Foundation for all that you do.\nMr. Shafroth. Thank you.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator Hirono. I appreciate what\nyou have just added there at the end, Mr. Shafroth. I think\nthat is something that we all get focused on our favorite parks\nor the ones that, perhaps, are most well known, but we have\nsome extraordinary treasures in other parts of the country--\nthat a little bit of encouragement to go to the lesser known\nparks, I think, is good.\nMr. Shafroth. Wrangell-St. Elias is a good one for\ninstance.\nThe Chairman. It is one of the best, isn't it? In fact, I\nwould hope to get out there in August.\nLet's go to Senator Hoeven from the great State of North\nDakota.\nSenator Hoeven. Thank you, Madam Chairman, I appreciate it\nvery much and speaking of, we all tend to focus on our favorite\nparks. I am going to do that right off the bat and start with\nMr. Shafroth and bring up the Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nin North Dakota which is truly wonderful and beautiful. And you\nknow, obviously with the passage of the Great American Outdoors\nAct now by the House and waiting for the President's signature,\na very important part of that was the Restore Our Parks Act\nwhich I co-sponsored along with others and that provides a lot\nof funding for addressing deferred maintenance in our parks.\nCan you talk to me a little bit about your thoughts on\naddressing deferred maintenance in the Theodore Roosevelt\nNational Park, particularly the scenic loop in the South Unit?\nI would appreciate your thoughts and your comments.\nMr. Shafroth. Sure, thank you, Senator Hoeven, and thanks\nagain for your support for the Great American Outdoors Act and\nRestore Our Parks.\nYeah, and I apologize, I have the numbers memorized for\nmany parks, but I can't remember whether it's $34 or $43\nmillion in deferred maintenance work that needs to be done at\nTeddy Roosevelt National Park, including filling the sinkhole\nin that road you described and as well as many other aspects,\nthe visitor center, the maintenance shed, the Peaceful Valley.\nThere's lots of work that continues, that needs to be done\nthere. Those are all very important things. I don't think--we\ntalked a bit about this earlier, about the process by which the\nPark Service and Congress will prioritize the projects that get\ndone, but I think the challenge that exists in the park in\nNorth Dakota, Senator, as well as many others is how do we\ncombine, you know, the private resources with the Great\nAmerican Outdoors Act and maybe other federal resources to both\naddress the deferred maintenance backlog as well as the\nmodernization of these places.\nAnd I think you understand, having been to the visitor\ncenter in Teddy Roosevelt National Park that it's fine if we\nrepair the roof and fix the windows, things like that, and the\nHVAC, but we really want to have a different kind of\nexperience, especially with the future development of the\nTheodore Roosevelt, President Theodore Roosevelt Presidential\nLibrary Foundation. And so, we need to, kind of, try to lift\nup, I think, all of those assets at the same time.\nSenator Hoeven. Talk a little bit as well about your\nsupport for the library project.\nMr. Shafroth. Sure. The Foundation has been working very\nclosely with the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library\nFoundation to try to work in tandem with them and the Park\nService to create a more complete experience to the visitor who\ncomes to Medora, to the park, to the area, to learn about the\nlife and legacy of Theodore Roosevelt. And so, we're, you know,\nactually right now, they're in the process of identifying an\narchitect to create, to look at ways in which we can create\ndistributed experiences for visitors to that part of the, of\nyour state. And you know, whether it be the Medora show or you\nknow, the experiences that will happen in a building that the\nLibrary Foundation will have and as well as the many\nexperiences that one could have in the Park, whether it be\npotentially mountain biking from the North Unit to the South\nUnit to having wilderness experiences and other kinds of\nrecreational amenities. That's going to create, you know, that\nintegrated, collaborative experience that I think we can create\nthere is very exciting.\nSenator Hoeven. I would like to go to Mr. Lane, if I could,\nfor just a minute.\nIn your opinion, on the public lands, what can Congress do\nto help our cattlemen? It is such a hard time out there for our\nranchers and our cattlemen and, of course, they graze on the\nnational grasslands. What, in your opinion, could we do in\nCongress to help improve how we do that on our public lands and\nhow we can help our ranchers, our cattlemen?\nMr. Lane. I think--I appreciate the question. I think first\nand foremost looking at that regulatory structure that\ncattlemen deal with now when they're working with federal\ngrazing permits is the biggest area where Congress can help,\nmaking sure to communicate to the agencies what your\nexpectation is of the implementation of the myriad laws that\nthey have to navigate in order to implement those permits. I\nthink there's a lot of fear in federal lands management as it\nrelates to grazing at this point. I think because of the\nlitigation that impacts almost every decision made by either\nthe Forest Service or the BLM, more than I can list in a\nhearing like this. Rather than making the decision that's best\nfor the resource, they make the decision that's most likely to\navoid them spending the next ten years in court with activist\nlitigants. So I think wherever you can look for opportunities\nto bolster their decision-making and give them a firm base\nwithin which to make the best decision for the resource, you're\nempowering them to make better decisions for our producers\nacross the country.\nSenator Hoeven. Okay, my time is up here, but if you have\nother specific ideas that you think would help, I would really\nappreciate if you would forward them to my office.\nThanks so much, and thank you, Chairman.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator Hoeven.\nLet's turn to Senator Cortez Masto.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you, Chairwoman.\nLet me also echo Senator Hoeven's response and question to\nMr. Lane. It is great to see you here. I support targeted\ngrazing. I think you do need the flexibility to reduce fuel\nloads. Any other ideas you have, please send those to my office\nas well.\nI appreciate you participating and every one else for being\nhere as part of this important panel.\nMr. Kemper, I would like to start with you. In your written\ntestimony you mentioned that there is a scarcity of water\ntreatment officers and that this was a concern prior to the\npandemic, but specifically your testimony references that\nbecause water is undervalued, we have a hard time recruiting\npeople to work in the industry. So is there a strong role for\nthe Federal Government to play in helping to facilitate that\nworkforce development as it relates to water and water\ninfrastructure?\nMr. Kemper. Thank you for your question, Senator.\nYes, I do think there is, especially helping out with\neducation and there's a role for training operators, water and\nwastewater operators. So I do think that in providing just\ncross training of water and wastewater operators would be\nreally a benefit and that could come from the Federal\nGovernment and also, just assistance should we actually run\nshort of operators to be able to provide help in that regard.\nYes, it would be very beneficial.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Yes, the workforce--there is no\ndoubt, it is a key and it is a constant we keep hearing over\nand over again.\nMr. Hepler, let me ask you this. In your testimony you\nstate that social distancing requirements have complicated\nstate and federal Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) management and\ncontrol efforts across the country. If left unchecked, AIS will\nspread within a water body and through recreational boating and\nother water sports activities and be inadvertently spread to\nother water bodies. Obviously we all have concerns about that.\nCan you further elaborate on the preventative measures that are\nbeing put in place by wildlife agencies at boat inspection\npoints and your concerns there.\nMr. Hepler. Thank you, Senator.\nYeah, this is, this actually hits home to South Dakota very\nwell. We had zebra mussels show up in a top end of a drainage\nthat borders with North Dakota/South Dakota and this drainage\ncomes out to a lot of very important lakes for recreational\nuse, home use and also one of our major hatcheries. And you\nknow, when this, when COVID first hit, you know, we wanted to\nhave teams out there checking boats, checking waters and\nbecause of our concern about getting social distancing, we just\ncouldn't, we weren't in a place to be able to do that until we\nworked through and came to those safe measures.\nAnd so, we look at that and we can do those on the ground,\nbut also the cooperation between states, you know, with Senator\nBarrasso and Wyoming and how we interact with how they do\nbusiness and their lakes are a little bit different than ours.\nHow we interact with Minnesota, these border states and that\nhappens across the country, that communication is key. Every\nstate is driven a little bit differently than other states by,\nyou know, how the Governor, how they view the importance of\ninvasive species or not. Governor Noem in the State of South\nDakota last year sponsored some legislation to really raise the\nawareness. It brought into the cabinet discussion, just not us\nfrom Fish and Game, but also the Agriculture Department because\nthat's really where the greatest concern is for a lot of these\ninvasive species and get--in going through your dams.\nSo I think there's been a lot of work, but I mean, what's\nfrustrating with this is that for the most part all can you do\nis slow the spread and I'd love to be able to say there's some\nmagical way, a lot of ways we can stop these things,\nunfortunately there's not. And I don't know how kind our\nchildren are going to feel when they come to look at some of\nthese things, but we're trying and we are trying to slow that\nspread, but it's a heck of a deal. And I certainly appreciate\nthe work of those federal agencies getting some of that funding\nand there's some bills out there, talk some more about that.\nBut you know, we're open to other ideas of communication, but\nyou know, we have to make a difference. We have to at least\ngive this a shot.\nSenator, I hope that answered your question.\nSenator Cortez Masto. It does, thank you.\nAnd then, coming from Nevada we are seeing more wildfires,\nin general. I mean, just talking with all of you because I\nthink as I am hearing more people are out recreating, maybe,\nfor the first time, it is important that we have an education\ncampaign for people to understand the responsibility as well.\nAny other ideas that any of you have because I do have\nconcerns about wildfires, rangeland fires, fires in our parks.\nWe are seeing more of that, unfortunately caused by humans. And\nso, any other thoughts on what we need to know at a federal\nlevel that we have not talked about already in this panel\ndiscussion which has been fantastic? So thank you, and I will\njust open it up to the panel.\nMr. Lane. Yeah, Senator, I think as the grazing community\nreally sees a lot of this firsthand as they're working their\nranches and they see those recreation enthusiasts come out onto\ntheir grazing allotments. I think education, not just about,\nkind of, how those resources are being used, but where they are\nis a critical part of that. Mixed surface management\nresponsibility for those of us that work in these environments\ncan still be very confusing. Am I on Forest Service land? Am I\non BLM land? Am I on private land? And what are the changes I\nneed to make in how I'm recreating based on which of those I\nmight be on, or state land for that matter.\nI think that there's far too little interpretation and\ninformation available out there for visitors to public lands\nthat's easily accessible. If they can grab a map when they're\nheading out into the back country, if they can have some more\ninformation on gosh, when I'm crossing over a cattle guard I\nneed to make sure that I leave a gate the way I found it\nbecause there's either some animals that need to kept in or\nkept out of a certain area or there's a sensitive species\nthat's being managed very carefully in this area or that. I\nthink most of that is completely missed and it's not their\nfault, it's just not something they're aware of if they're not\nhaving to deal with it on a day in, day out basis. So I think\nthat education component needs to be far more comprehensive and\nfar more readily accessible to those users.\nMr. Kemper. Senator, certainly doing everything we can.\nColorado has a forest and water alliance, California has a\nsimilar group, that are really working to try to increase the\npace and scale of work on resilient forests, things like the\nCollaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, the Water\nSource Protection Program. But as it was referenced in earlier\ntestimony, I think that I, you know, we've had 9,000, 9,000\nboat decontaminations so far this year that is removing aquatic\nnuisance species from boats and that education is really\nimportant. Those are 9,000 opportunities.\nThe other problem that we have is that people are not\nnecessarily knowing what's a public land and what's not and\naccess to water infrastructure and there's a story in my\ntestimony about the difficulties that when we have Ag\ninfrastructure that is on public lands that people are leaving\ngates open, not knowing where they are supposed to be and not.\nSo there's concern there.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you. I know I have gone over my\ntime. Thank you very much.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator Cortez Masto.\nI think we have had a good range of questions here this\nmorning, and I appreciate the range from colleagues here and\nthe responses from our panel. I just have a couple more here\nbefore we wrap up.\nI mentioned I really had a great two weeks when I was back\nhome, but don't let me digress, then I will start showing you\nmy pictures. But one of the things that I saw when I was in\nDenali National Park, as folks are aware, you have one very\nlong, very narrow and very scenic road deep into the park and\nduring the season you are able to gain access by way of a bus\nand it is not a fancy bus, it is a bus. As a result of the\nlimitations in the park and the social distancing requirements,\nwe have seen fewer people in those buses, fewer buses, but I\ncommend the leadership there at Denali in recognizing that they\nneeded to figure out a little bit of flexibility if we are\ngoing to get people into the park. How do we do this and do it\nsafely?\nI ran into two commercial operators who have temporary\ncommercial use authorizations and they guide very small\ngroups--when I say small, two cars. So this is a pretty limited\nsituation. One was actually guided by a fellow who was driving\na Tesla which is a feat in itself over those gravel roads. Nice\ncar, but that is the first electric car to be piloting into the\npark. The other group was one pilot car, a Jeep and two other\nJeeps again. So very limited, very small, but it gives a level\nof flexibility and it gives some opportunities with temporary\npermits. I was pleased to see that in Denali.\nDoes anybody have any suggestions as to ways that either\nthrough Interior or Forest Service we can provide greater\nflexibility to those who do have permits in recognizing that we\nare all looking to accommodate in different ways and it might\nlook different in other areas? Maybe, Ms. Turner, you have some\nexamples that you have heard of? I am curious to know if anyone\nhas any suggestions with regards to that?\nMs. Turner.\nMs. Turner. Thank you for that, and I've actually been on\nthat Denali helicopter ride and landed on a glacier so I know\nexactly what that experience is like and it's really\nunfortunate that less people are having that experience.\nYou know, I think the fee waivers right now are so top of\nmind because they're so necessary to just keep these folks in\nbusiness. But beyond that, contract extensions and permit\nextensions are incredibly important. The agencies aren't going\nto be processing new permits, so it's really important that\nbusinesses have some certainty that maybe they'll have a year\nor two more on their contract to figure something out, like you\nsaw in Denali. And then, I think, the SOAR Act has a lot of\nflexibilities in it that would provide help and support for\nguides and outfitters, concessionaires, permittees for a while\nbeyond this pandemic.\nThe Chairman. Thanks, I appreciate that.\nWe have talked about the increase in visitation whether it\nis on our national parks or our state parks or our public\nlands, and I think that that is good as families have gotten\noutdoors and obviously the effort that the President will\nhopefully soon sign into law, the Great American Outdoors Act,\nagain is going to encourage that we are doing more to just\nbetter take care of our parks and our public areas.\nAny suggestions to us on what Congress and our federal land\nmanagers can do to ensure that we sustain this momentum by\nlocal tourism that we have seen this summer? Again, I mention\nthings slow down in Alaska in the winter time. It is different,\nagain, in places that host ski areas, but I think we recognize\nthe value that these tourist dollars bring to many of our\ncommunities. Not only the value, but just the enhancement to\nour lives when we are able to get out and recreate like this.\nWe don't want to have another pandemic situation next summer.\nWe don't want that to be the thing that keeps us continuing to\nvisit our public lands. Any suggestions in terms of how we\ncontinue with the efforts that will bring increased\nvisitorship?\nMr. Shafroth. Madam Chairman, a thought that I have is, you\nknow, we are engaged in a pretty active campaign right now to\nwelcome people back to the parks. We have two different, sort\nof, ads out there, alright--one called ``Wonder Calls,''\nanother one related to the appreciation of our Park Service\nemployees and the hard work they do. And I think those messages\nkind of continue to remind people that these places are\namazing. They're part of our legacy, our history. I'll also say\ncombined with some messages around how to recreate responsibly\nso--people are, you know, fearful at some level and we need to\nlet them know that there's a way that we can do this that's\nsafe to allow you to get back in the park and do what you want\nto do. So I kind of feel like there's dual messages we need to\ncontinue to push out there to remind people how great they are\nand just to make sure they understand that it's a little bit of\na different game.\nMs. Turner. And I would just add the health connection. I\nthink we're seeing the outdoors as really a solution, possibly,\nor helpful in the pandemic. People need Vitamin D. They need\nexercise. They need to be experiencing the outdoors. I think\nconnecting parks and our public lands really to health, keeping\npeople healthy and communities healthy is maybe a new message.\nWe've known this all along, but the American public seems to\nhave really taken that to heart lately. And if we could\ncontinue to connect that, I think we can create lifestyles\nwhere people weave outdoor activity and these parks and public\nlands into their daily habits.\nThe Chairman. Mr. Lane.\nMr. Lane. I think we also need to make sure that we're\npaying attention to the health of the resource as we see these\nbalances change of people using these landscapes, particularly\nwhere we see municipalities meeting some of these managed\nfederal environments. Some of the prescribed burns that\notherwise would have helped keep those resources healthy have\nbeen canceled or delayed due to COVID-19, looking for some\nopportunities to use tools like grazing as a substitute to\nensure that where we couldn't get our first choice done to\nmanage some of those fuel loads, that we can put some other\ntools in place to ensure that the work still gets done and that\nwe still have those active management regimes in place is\nimportant as we move through this, sort of, fluid time in\nmanaging these lands.\nThe Chairman. Mr. Hepler.\nMr. Hepler. Madam Chair, I'd also add that, you know,\nbesides the health piece which we absolutely agree with, we're\ngoing to work that at a national level, is that this is an\nopportunity to get people in the past where we maybe haven't\nbeen in the indoor parks whether they're federal or state. And\nso, whether they're--so we want people of color to be able to\ncome in these parks and do it safely. There's a whole diversity\nthere and if we want to remain relevant as state agencies and\nas federal agencies, you know, we need to make sure the whole\nbroad spectrum that represents this great country of ours, is\nwelcoming to our public areas. And there's a certain amount of\nresponsibility that comes with that.\nI think this is one golden opportunity. One good thing that\ncan come out of this COVID-19 crisis we're in is bringing those\npeople into the fold and let them now it's good to get outside\nand whether that's outside in the city park in a big city, you\nknow, or coming to one of our wonderful state parks. By the\nway, we're open for business in South Dakota. We'd love to have\nyou come visit. Come to South Dakota. But either way, it's the\nsame message. We want to be able to do it safely, feel\ncomfortable and enjoy themselves.\nThe Chairman. Right.\nMr. Kemper, do you want to add a final word there?\nMr. Kemper. The other thing that is not quite relevant to\nthat but the concern out there about the loss of revenue from\nseverance tax is really having a huge impact and there's a lot\nof collaborative efforts that go on that some of that money\ngets directed toward both for aging infrastructure for water\nand it's something I think would be helpful for the Committee\nto keep monitoring on as that loss of production and the\nseverance tax impacts because it does impact the investments in\nthe forest landscape resiliency program.\nThe Chairman. Well, I appreciate you adding that. I think\nwe had a good discussion about some of the impact of the\ndeferred maintenance issues on our public lands, and we\nrecognize that.\nA couple of you have mentioned the need to make sure that\nwe are being responsible out there, and I had mentioned that\nseveral of the experiences that I had were very positive where\npeople are accepting certain protocols as they are out enjoying\nour parks. I am also hearing that as we are encouraging more of\nthe local people around our parks to use our parks during this\ntime of COVID, for oftentimes what happens is those that are\nclosest to the parks are so busy serving the people who are\ncoming from other areas that they don't even get into these\nvery special places.\nAt a time like this where perhaps your small business is\nnot operating or it is at greatly reduced volumes, you actually\nhave time to go out and experience it yourself. I have heard in\nmy state some Alaskans saying, ``I love this area, but I felt\nlike I was not welcomed in my park.'' That is hard to hear, and\nthat is not the message that we want, whether it is from our\nparks or from our Forest Service or from those who are managing\nour public lands. These are America's areas. These are all of\nour ours. This is not something special just built for Park\nService employees or for Forest Service employees to enjoy the\nbenefit.\nI think it is important that we respect the fact that we\nwelcome all Americans to our parks and whether it is the locals\nor whether it is families who have never had that opportunity.\nWe mentioned people of color and doing more to make them feel\nwelcome in our parks. This is a job and a responsibility that\nwe all have.\nSo we will be working toward that, but thank you for your\ninput this morning. I think it has been very helpful, and as we\nmove forward with this next round of COVID relief, know that\nmany on this Committee are looking out for those who have been\nimpacted in ways and perhaps not seen that level of support\nthat will be necessary to carry them through.\nWith that, I thank you again and the Committee stands\nadjourned.\n[Whereupon, at 12:11 p.m. the hearing was adjourned.]\nAPPENDIX MATERIAL SUBMITTED\n----------\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\n[all]",

Marco Rubio,\nChairman of the Committee, presiding.\nPresent: Senators Rubio, Ernst, Young, Kennedy, Romney,\nHawley, Cardin, Cantwell, Shaheen, Coons, and Duckworth.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARCO RUBIO, CHAIRMAN, A U.S. SENATOR\nFROM FLORIDA\nChairman Rubio. Today's hearing of the Senate Committee on\nBusiness and Entrepreneurship will come to order. I apologize.\nWe are in the grips of a terrible plot against the Senate Small\nBusiness Committee. They keep scheduling like 18 votes at the\nsame time as our meeting. I think we are going to change our\nname. But anyway, so the members will be coming in and out. I\ndo not know what the--no one can tell us exactly what the\nfuture holds, but they will keep us up-to-date here on it. And\nSenator Cardin will be in in a minute.\nI am going to abbreviate my opening statement in the\ninterest of time so we can get through this and not delay it\nany further.\nToday we are going to be having a pretty good conversation\nabout the SBIC program, which is one of the earliest SBA\nprograms. The impetus was a Federal Reserve Report that showed\nsignificant gaps in the business credit and equity markets,\nwith the most prominent gap being found in the small business\nsector. And the report recommended the SBA to create a program\nto provide equity financing to small businesses. This resulted\nin the SBIC program that, in turn, popularized the venture\ncapital model of investment in the 1960s and 1970s. And since\nthen, the program has continued to provide venture capital\nfinancing to fill the gap in investment in small business by\nthe private sector.\nThe impact of the program is immense. In 2017, the Library\nof Congress prepared a report that measured the role of the\nprogram in small business job creation. It only covered the\ntimeframe between October 1995 and December 2014, but found\nthat the program created almost 3 million jobs during this\nperiod, which is one new job created for every $14,000 in SBIC\ninvestment. It also looked at administrative costs, and found\nthe average administrative cost was approximately $35 per job\ncreated. So it is a clear example of the type of public-private\npartnership that fills a gap in the private marketplace and\ncreates quantifiable results.\nIt is a proven program that has historically met investment\nneeds not being met by the private sector, and so it is prudent\nto reassess the state of investment in the United States,\nidentify gaps in financing, and evaluate the opportunities that\nexist for this program to fill those gaps under current\nexample.\nFor example, there are meaningful market failures in the\ncurrent configuration of the American innovation and advanced\nmanufacturing ecosystem. The United States is beginning now the\ndifficult work of confronting Chinese industrial policy, which\nhas a clear goal of dominating the most important industries of\nthe century, through government support, credits, access to\nguaranteed market share in their own large, domestic market.\nAnd so it is prudent for us to consider how we align public\npolicy to address these market failures in the light of this\ndirect national competition.\nThe access to capital challenge that is facing innovative\nAmerican firms with high-growth potential is damaging our\ncountry's competitiveness, and the financing gap is not being\nfilled by private investment. Today, venture capital funding in\nthe U.S. is highly concentrated by geography, primarily in\nareas like San Francisco, New York, and Boston, and by\nindustry, largely to information and communication technology\ncompanies.\nThe relatively short window for expected returns, combined\nwith the prioritization of highly scalable, capital-light\nbusinesses for investment, skews funding toward digital\ntechnology and skews it away from capital-intensive\nmanufacturing sectors with longer profit horizons. So creating\nan environment in which U.S. firms can compete globally, while\ncreating jobs in the United States, is in our vital interest,\nbecause if the policy fails to address it, the United States\nwill continue to lose to other nations, both in our capacity to\nproduce now and our capacity to innovate in the future.\nThese small advanced manufacturing firms, in particular,\nface a debilitating lack of access to critical finance in the\nU.S. Innovative firms engaged in complex, advanced\nmanufacturing production require larger amounts of capital and\nthey also require more time than non-production firms. While\nthese kinds of firms can often find financing for the earlier\nstages of their development, they face difficulty accessing\nfinancing when they reach the larger-scale production and\ncommercialization stage. Since innovation and production are so\nclosely interwoven in advanced manufacturing, losing the\nability to engage in advanced manufacturing production is\nprohibitive to the ability to innovate and conduct high-level\nresearch and development.\nSo the SBIC program is uniquely positioned to play a role\nin filling this gap in financing and to leverage private\ndomestic investment. After all, one of its tenets is to support\nindustries that will undergird our national competitiveness.\nOur discussion today will explore the role of the SBIC\nprogram, the role it can play in this national discussion, as\nwell as further expand upon its history, stability, and\nsuccess. I look forward to discussing this with everyone.\nAre you ready?\nSenator Cardin. I am ready.\nChairman Rubio. All right. I will turn it over to the\nRanking Member.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN, A U.S. SENATOR\nFROM MARYLAND\nSenator Cardin. First, let me apologize for the lateness of\nstarting this. As I am sure the Chairman has explained, we have\nbeen in a series of votes on the floor of the Senate, and there\nhas been some discussion as to how we are going to proceed\nlater today. I was involved in some of those discussions so I\napologize for being a little bit late.\nI want to welcome all of our witnesses. This is our seventh\nhearing in regard to the reauthorization of the programs under\nthe Small Business Administration.\nI think we all understand that the building block needed to\nstart and grow business is capital, so today's hearing is\nparticularly important. It was in 1958 that the Small Business\nInvestment Act was passed by Congress, which recognized the\nrealities that for small business it is very difficult to find\ninvestment dollars.\nSince then, the SBIC program has invested more than $97\nbillion in 10,000 small businesses, including many well-known\ncompanies like Intel, Apple, and FedEx. Last year alone, SBIC\nfacilitated more than $5.5 billion in investment to more than\n1,100 high-growth companies across the country, at zero cost to\nthe American taxpayers. This funding is vital because\ntraditional venture capital is overwhelmingly concentrated in\nurban centers in New York, Massachusetts, and California, with\nless than 1 percent of all venture capital going to businesses\nin rural communities.\nThe lack of diversity is not just geographical. Around 2\npercent of venture capital goes to women-owned businesses, and\nonly 1 percent goes to black- and Hispanic-owned businesses.\nThat is not acceptable.\nThere are businesses in every community throughout America\nthat could achieve growth if only they had the capital, and\nthat is why we need the SBIC program.\nConsider, for example, Zentech Manufacturing, a Baltimore\ncompany that designs and builds high-tech circuit boards,\ncables, and other parts for companies in the defense and\nmedical technology industries. When Zentech needed capital to\nprevent a takeover that would have shut down the company in\nMaryland and shipped dozens of jobs overseas, an SBIC fund was\nthe only entity that could provide the type of capital Zentech\nneeded.\nSince then, the company has increased its workforce by more\nthan 60 percent and has successfully competed against overseas\ncompanies for contracts, reassuring manufacturing jobs here in\nthe United States. These are well-paid jobs that are lifting\nfamilies into the middle class.\nThe simple truth is that traditional venture capital\nindustry is doing an inadequate job of directing capital to\ncommunities most in need, and companies like Zentech are\nmissing out on the opportunities for growth and job creation as\na result.\nThe SBIC program fills a very wide gap in traditional\nventure capital markets. But more importantly, SBIC is a good\ninvestment for the taxpayers. According to the 2017 Library of\nCongress report, SBIC creates one job for every $35 spent\nadministering the program, and SBIC investments support\nminority- and women-owned businesses more than twice as often\nas traditional venture capital. That is not enough, but at\nleast it is better.\nWhile SBIC does is a better job of reaching underserved\ncommunities, we still have to do a lot more. Our focus today\nmust be on how we can take the SBIC program from a good program\nto a great program, a more inclusive program that reaches\nunderserved communities frozen out of the traditional venture\ncapital markets.\nWe can begin by exploring how to build a pipeline of\ndiverse investors into the SBIC program, because we know that\nracially and gender-diverse SBIC funds investment more\nfrequently in minority- and women-owned businesses. We also\nneed common-sense reforms to make the SBIC program more\nattractive to investors and more efficient for those who run\nSBIC funds, especially expediting the licensing process.\nThese are some steps that will significantly improve the\nSBIC program as well as create jobs and value in communities\nnationwide. So I am looking forward to the discussion we have\ntoday, how we can improve the SBIC program, and the role that\nthis Committee can play in facilitating those changes.\nChairman Rubio. Thank you. Our first panel is one witness.\nJoseph Shepard is the Associate Administrator of the Office of\nInvestment and Innovation at the Small Business Administration.\nHe held the same position in the Administration of former\nPresident George W. Bush.\nMr. Shepard, thank you for being here. We will begin with\nyour testimony, and again, our apologies.\nSTATEMENT OF JOSEPH SHEPARD, ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR, OFFICE OF\nINVESTMENT AND INNOVATION, U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION,\nWASHINGTON, DC\nMr. Shepard. Good. Good. Thank you, both, Chairman Rubio,\nthank you, and Ranking Member Cardin, thank you as well, and\nmembers of the Committee who will join us later, I am sure. I\nappreciate the opportunity to be here before you and discuss\nthe reauthorization of SBA's Small Business Investment Company,\nor SBIC, program.\nI have spent a great deal of my private equity career in\nand around the SBIC program. In addition to having worked for\nan SBIC, several of my mentors were trained in SBICs, and from\nthem I learned much of my on-the-job training and due\ndiligence, financial analysis, investment structure, and\ntransaction processing.\nPrior to assuming my current position at SBA on March 22,\n2017, the SBIC program's capital-at-risk increased 1.8 times\nfrom $7.9 billion as of September 30, 2010, to $14.2 billion as\nof December 31, 2016. During this time, the SBA did not keep\npace with this growth in areas such as technology,\nexaminations, risk, SBIC program costs, and personnel.\nDuring my time at SBA, I have worked with the SBA team to\nidentify challenges faced by the SBIC program, and together we\nhave been endeavoring to modernize the program and make\nimprovements. During this time, I have enjoyed the support and\nleadership of former administrator Linda McMahon, and I greatly\nappreciate the hard work of the SBIC program team and all my\ncolleagues at the SBA.\nFollowing is a brief summary of the select improvements\nthat we have made within the SBIC program.\nThere have been no major technology improvements to the\nSBIC program since 1994. Since my arrival at SBA, it has been a\npriority of mine to modernize the SBIC program's information\ntechnology infrastructure. During the past two years, we have\ntransitioned the legacy SBIC Web data collection system to\nSBA's Office of the Chief Information Officer, conducted an\nextensive review of the SBIC program's existing technology,\nprocured a new software platform, and this year began the\nconfiguration of the new software. The implementation of this\nnew software platform will allow the SBA to improve the\ninformation associated with the SBIC program and dramatically\nimprove the SBA's data security, risk management and oversight\ncapabilities.\nPrior to my arrival, challenges associated with the SBIC\nexaminations were present, as a result of issues and practices\nprior to fiscal year 2017. A 2013 SBA Inspector General report\nhad also identified deficiencies in the management of the SBIC\nexamination process.\nStatute requires that SBICs be examined at least every two\nyears. SBA began fiscal year 2017 with an estimated 56.9\npercent of SBICs in statutory compliance. In fiscal year 2017,\nI recommended and then implemented an examination surge. Today,\nstatutory compliance has improved dramatically and is now at\n100 percent.\nAdditionally, to better mitigate current and future credit\nrisk in the SBIC program, the SBA enhanced its credit standard\nto require that all SBICs with SBA guaranteed leverage be\nexamined within an 18-month time period.\nIn fiscal year 2018, I initiated the creation of a new\neconometric subsidy model to replace the SBA's 27-year-old\nmodel. The result is an improved subsidy model that is\nreflective of the inherent risks associated with present-day\nprivate equity investing, and we believe will more accurately\nproject future losses and long-term costs of the current SBIC\nprogram to taxpayers.\nThe SBIC program also has a total operating cost each year\nthat is not covered by subsidy. SBA's total cost to operate the\nSBIC program during fiscal year 2018 was $27.3 million. Since\nmy arrival we have focused on ways to reduce taxpayer costs\nassociated with SBIC program expenses.\nIn 2017, SBA increased licensing fees paid by SBIC\napplicants and examination fees paid by operating SBICs. Both\nfees had not been increased since 1996.\nFinally, the SBIC program's workforce needs to evolve.\nApproximately 31 percent of the program's current position\ndescriptions are 15 years or older, and 41 percent are 7 to 13-\nyears-old. The oldest position description is 22 years old and\nwas last revised in 1997. A contractor has been engaged to\nassist us in revising all outdated position descriptions. SBA\nwill continue to hire additional staff and fill current future\nvacancies. New positions are also being created and filled,\nincluding an IT project manager, IT data scientist, senior\nexaminer, senior risk and investment policy officer, and an\ninvestment accounting and analytics officer. I am committed to\nhiring for an organization that can support the program of the\nfuture.\nIn conclusion, actions taken over the last two years have\nimproved the SBIC program. Many of these changes and\nimprovements are generational in nature with no previous such\nimprovements occurring since the 1990s or for the past 20\nyears. As a result, the SBIC program is in a better position\ntoday to face the challenges of the future.\nThank you.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Shepard follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nChairman Rubio. Thank you. Mr. Shepard, I want to begin my\nquestions by--I want to read you the statement of policy of the\nSmall Business Investment Act. It is the law that created this.\nIn creating this program, this is what Congress stated as its\nintent.\nHere is a quote: ``Stimulate and supplement the flow of\nprivate equity capital and long-term loan funds which small\nbusiness concerns need for the sound financing of their\nbusiness operations and for their growth, expansion, and\nmodernization, and which are not available in adequate\nsupply.'' End quote. That is the stated intent.\nIt seems to me that Congress made clear when they passed\nit, and it is reiterated in many reforms to the law, that the\nintent of the SBIC program is to provide patient capital to\nsmall businesses that private financial markets do not\notherwise provide.\nSo let me ask, do you agree with Congress' enacted law and\nstated intent----\nMr. Shepard. Oh, absolutely.\nChairman Rubio [continuing]. The goal of the--well, do you\nagree that the intent--let me just ask it this way. Do you\nagree that the law and the stated intent is to supplement the\nprivate market by increasing the flow of long-term funds to\nsmall businesses?\nMr. Shepard. Yes.\nChairman Rubio. Okay. Because in your testimony you implied\nthat risk has increased in recent years, or at least has been\nundervalued, making necessary and update of the subsidy model\nSBA uses for the SBIC program. So, for example, you say that\nfrom fiscal year 2010 to 2018, the program experienced charge-\noffs where SBA expenditures on loans have defaulted, of $281\nmillion for the debenture program.\nAs you are aware, charge-off costs are not the only payment\nfactor in the program. The SBA can recover assets on loans that\nhave defaulted. They can charge fees on operating loans to\ncover costs.\nIs it not it true that during the same period the SBIC\ndebenture program operated on a zero-subsidy basis?\nMr. Shepard. That is correct, yes.\nChairman Rubio. And is it also true that during this period\nthe fees the SBA charges on the debenture SBIC program has been\nlower than the historical average?\nMr. Shepard. Yes, absolutely. That is correct.\nChairman Rubio. So you say in your testimony that upon your\ninitiative, the SBA will begin to use a new econometric model\nto calculate its costs, that the model will include new\nassumptions like macroeconomic factors, private equity\nelements, private equity fund characteristics.\nYou answered the first question agreeing, right, that the\npurpose of this is to provide funding that private market was\nnot meeting. One of the purposes of the SBIC program is to fix\nthat market failure, to increase the long-term patient capital\nthat goes into small businesses, which would not be made\navailable without the program.\nIt is true, I think you would agree, that part of achieving\nthis purpose is investing in small businesses that are\nthemselves investing in innovations and new products which are,\nby definition, more uncertain investments than what the private\nmarket writ large has to offer.\nMr. Shepard. Right.\nChairman Rubio. So will the assumptions you have added to\nthe historical model SBA has used, will it increase or decrease\nthe time horizon of capital financing for these small\nbusinesses?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. Thank you for--good question, Chairman. I\nthank you for the question. The intent of the subsidy model,\nthat will not impact the disbursement of capital. The intent\nthere, and with a lot of the things that I mentioned in the\nopening comment, were generational, things that have not been\nfixed, getting the program ready for the future, getting it\nready for whatever may come.\nWe looked at the subsidy model and we looked at how the\nportfolio was constructed, currently about $15 billion, and its\nmove into more equity-oriented investments. When the model was\nbuilt it was more debt-oriented, so I wanted to make sure--and\nwe, as a team, wanted to make sure that we were accounting for\nfuture losses, and let's have a better model in place so as to\nstewards the taxpayer dollars we do not experience loss in the\nfuture. That was the intent.\nChairman Rubio. You agree the metrics, the private\nfinancial markets are used, are more short-term, or sorry. I\nguess, let me ask you, are the metrics the private market uses\nmore short-term or long-term in their views than the current\nSBA model?\nMr. Shepard. I think they are similar. I think a lot of the\ninvesting activity that takes place in the SBIC model, the\nmajority of it is subordinated debt of mezzanine, and it has\ngot, you know, a maybe 3-, 5-, 7-year time horizon, very\nsimilar to the private sector. So I do not feel like there is a\ndisconnect there, by any means.\nChairman Rubio. Well, and which private equity elements\nwill be used in assessing the default risk of--say there is a\ncompany that is developing a new cancer drug or a\ntelecommunications equipment that can compete with Huawei. And\nwould private equity elements investment in small business\ntaking on these challenges without an SBIC program?\nMr. Shepard. Well, to the subsidy model, we will be working\nwith OMB. The implementation will occur in 2021. We are\nreviewing those right now, in terms of what those will be. They\nwill be more macroeconomic in terms of trying to anticipate\nmacroeconomic factors in our economy. And so it will be less\noriented toward specific industries and more oriented toward\nthe economy as a whole.\nChairman Rubio. Well, I guess my last question--and I am\ngoing to turn it over to the Ranking Member--in developing the\nmodel, have you considered the shortfalls of equity valuation\nmethods like the capital asset pricing model or others that are\ncommonly used in the private markets, and undervaluing the\ndevelopment of long-term innovative product?\nAs an example, which investment would capital asset pricing\nmodel more highly value, buying a share in an index fund in the\nS&P 500 or taking an equity stake in a company that, for\nexample, is making new agricultural machinery to pick crops\nlike strawberries in Florida that have been done manually? So\ndo you take into account, in the model, the well-established\nshortfalls of this valuation method?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. We are going to need to do that, without\nquestion.\nChairman Rubio. Thank you. Ranking Member.\nSenator Cardin. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for being\nhere and for your service. You heard in my opening statement\nthe concern I raised about opportunities in the traditional\nventure capital markets for women-owned businesses and minority\nbusinesses. And then I cited the SBIC numbers, which are twice\nas strong but still, I hope we all would agree, unacceptable.\nSo what are your recommendations for how we can have a more\ndiverse use of the SBIC funds and use it to help particularly\nwomen- and minority-owned businesses?\nMr. Shepard. Right. Well, you know, I publicly stated\nbefore that, as the Chairman read, looking for areas in the\nintent and the mission of the SBIC program, to look for areas\nwhere there is not an adequate supply of capital, and certainly\nwomen, veterans, minorities, rural areas hit all of those\nareas. And I would say, as you look at our numbers, and as we\nhave talked in the past, they are anemic in the impact that the\nprogram has had in a lot of those areas. Much room for\nimprovement.\nAnd so I could not agree more that there is more that we\nshould do and need to do. I will note that SBA invests and\nbacks the capital that goes to the SBIC, and the SBIC\ninvestment managers are the ones who make those investments.\nSenator Cardin. I understand that completely. So how do we\nget--and that is why I said I think the key is to get more SBIC\ninvestors that are diverse, that represent diverse communities,\nincluding rural communities. How do we go about doing that?\nMr. Shepard. I think what we have got to do is we have got\nto back up and look at the licensing phase, and make\ndeterminations about what kind of SBICs are going to be\nlicensed and what plan are they going to put before the SBA, in\nterms of where their focus is going to be. Are you going to\nfocus in women and minority areas? Are you going to focus in\nrural areas? And we have got to make the determinations there\nand then keep them on plan once they get into the marketplace,\nif they successfully get an SBA license.\nAnd I would look forward to working with your team to talk\nabout--and the Committee--to talk about how can we do that? How\ncan we do that inside the SBA to make that happen?\nSenator Cardin. So for entrepreneur development we have\nspecial programs to try to help our veterans, to help women. Do\nwe need a similar program for the SBIC?\nMr. Shepard. I think we could certainly do it within the\ncurrent framework, but again, it begins in how do we license\nand who are we licensing to?\nSenator Cardin. So let me get to the licensing issue here,\nbecause I know that Chairman Risch, when he was Chairman of the\nCommittee, held a hearing that dealt with the concerns about\nthe length of time on the licensures, the complications. We\nhave been told a lot of potential licensees decide not to go\nthrough the process because they think it just takes too long,\nand that, at least the information that we have, it is getting\nworse rather than better, as far as the process itself for\nlicensure. The numbers of SBIC licenses that have been granted\nhas gone down.\nSo how do you streamline the license process to encourage\nmore investors but also do it in a way that recruits in\nunderserved communities?\nMr. Shepard. Right. Well, the technology improvements that\nI have talked about are certainly going to help. We are\nhopeful, by the end of the summer--by the end of the fiscal\nyear we will have implemented what we are calling the licensing\ntracker. So that should help us streamline and make our process\nmore efficient. So that is one way, from a technology\nstandpoint.\nWhen we have more startup, first-time small business\ninvestment companies, and we have seen an uptick in those, it\ndoes take a little longer to vet those. In the private sector\nit take anywhere from a year to two years. We are nowhere near\nthat timeframe. We do a much better job. But there is always\nroom for improvement. And so do we add more people? I am taking\ncare of the technology standpoint. So that speaks to process\nand improving the process and having a better process in place.\nIn terms of how do we get participants that are going to\ninvest in some of these areas you have mentioned, we are going\nto have to do that by encouraging those people to come in, and\nagain, are there ways to do that? Do we do that through\nregulation? Do we do that through statute? I think those are\nconversations that we need to have about the best way to impact\nthe few, if you will, to impact those applicants that are\ncoming in to invest in those types of small businesses.\nSo let me ask you one last question dealing with early\nstage investments, because that would also target more to\nunderserved communities if we had early stage investment. The\nprogram we did start was terminated, I believe for the reason\nthat it was claimed not to be cost-effective. Does this need\nstill exist, and how do we make it cost-effective?\nMr. Shepard. Well, that was one of the reasons. There also\nwas not a high degree of interest. A lot of it was the way the\ncurrent program is built, is the majority of the funds that\ncome in are subordinated debt or mezzanine. They are investing\nin operating companies that have existing cash flows that can\nservice that debt that they are borrowing through the SBA\nguarantee. And so they are not early stage or seed companies.\nAnd so that is what you are seeing in the portfolio right\nnow, if you will. That is what you are seeing in the SBIC.\nSenator Cardin. But would not early stage investment have a\ntendency to reach more of the underserved areas that are more\nwomen, more minorities, more rural?\nMr. Shepard. Certainly startups and certainly early stage,\nand one other thing is we do have unleveraged small business\ninvestment companies. The majority of those do invest in early\nstage. They are welcome to come into the program at any time,\nbecause it is not a credit risk to the government. It is not a\ncredit risk to the SBA. So they do come in to get the license,\nand many of them do invest in that area.\nSenator Cardin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Rubio. Senator Romney.\nSenator Romney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member.\nI appreciate the focus on this Committee on building our\neconomy and providing opportunities for all our citizens.\nI am interested in understanding just where it is in the\nentire spectrum of investment that this investment activity\nthat you carry out is playing a meaningful role. I do recognize\nthat there is an underrepresentation in the private equity and\nventure capital world in businesses that are led by or founded\nby minorities and women. Having worked in that industry for\nsome time, I would note that in my own experience very few of\nthe people that came to us with proposals were minorities or\nwomen, although we did invest in a number. Meg Whitman at FTD,\nJudy George at Domain, and Linda Mason at Bright Horizons. And\nlike most, some were successful and some were not.\nI do know that in the industry there is more money chasing\ndeals than there are good deals, and my experience is that,\nwell, at least from firms I knew, we would have invested in a\nMartian if we thought we could make money at it. So it was not\nthat we were afraid of investing with a particular type of\nAmerican. We just wanted the best deal we could possibly find\nthat made a bunch of money for our investors, and, ultimately,\nfor ourselves.\nGiven the fact that there is so much money in private\nequity today, billions upon billions, and so much money in\nventure capital, with SoftBank and others that are just\nflooding the market, where are the gaps where the private\nmarket is not reaching, that this investment activity on the\npart of the SBA is reaching?\nWhy do you exist, if you will, in this investment activity\nas opposed to just turning to the private market? Where are the\ngaps? Where are the places that you feel you need to play a\nrole? Is it with regards to minority opportunities? Is it with\nregards to investing in things that have social values that may\nnot have the high enough return to justify a standard venture\ncapital investors? Is it a certain region of the country? Are\nyou playing a redundant role that can be filled by the private\nsector, or are there really areas that you are filling that\nwould not be filled otherwise?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. Senator Romney, thank you for your\nquestion. I will say that the small business investment\ncompanies are certainly internal-rate-of-return driven. They\nare trying to return to their limited partners a certain retain\nthat has been promised to them, and then return the capital\nback to the SBA, that has been borrowed from the SBA. So their\nincentive is often return-based as opposed to based on\ninvesting in certain types of businesses. It maybe women-,\nminority-, veteran-owned, or geographic as well, in terms of\nrural investing. We would need to make some modifications to\nthe program to incentivize that investment activity, otherwise,\nthan its current state.\nIn terms of gaps, we need more information, and I am\nworking on getting a study together, hopefully beginning early\nin 2020, that will specifically address that issue, because we\nhave a concern about it as well, and where in the marketplace\nis the need? I will tell you that in 1999, the program size was\nabout $3 billion. It is now close to $15 billion. But there is\na component of that portfolio that are business development\ncompanies, for example. They are now at about $3 billion. It is\na pretty large concentration of the portfolio. It is between 20\nand 25 percent. And the majority of those publicly traded\ncompanies do provide unitranche debt, which is also senior\ndebt.\nAnd so there are certainly places where you can look at the\nportfolio and you can look at the activity and you can see\ncompetition with the free enterprise system. And the intent, of\ncourse, is to provide capital in those areas where there is not\nan adequate supply and not be competitive.\nAnd so not a great answer, because there are some unknowns,\nand we need to have some more information to define that\nbetter.\nSenator Romney. I would just note that I would think, in\ntraditional venture capital and private equity, that there\nreally is not a need for the government to participate and to,\nif you will, juice or leverage the returns that are available\nto private investors and private funds, that the reason for\nthis activity potentially being supported by Congress and by\nour government and taxpayers is if it is focused on addressing\na particular area where the need is not being met, where the\nprivate market is not reaching.\nAnd if the private market is effectively reaching every\narea then there is no particular reason for the taxpayer to\nsubsidize returns to private equity and venture capital funds.\nAnd even then, even if there are gaps, one would have to ask,\nare we better trying to find ways to get the people that live\nin those gaps, or the individuals that are affected by those\ngap areas, to have better access to the private markets, or\nshould government step in?\nSo these are, I think, real questions that I hope we will\nbe able to answer.\nMr. Shepard. Right. And one other thing I will add, we are\ncertainly, as you have mentioned, at an all-time high, in terms\nof private equity, close to $3 trillion, and maybe have\nsurpassed that, private equity-based in the United States. And\nwe have seen a decline in licensing activity because there is\nsuch an opportunity to raise capital in the private markets\nwith LPs there, and I think that is part of the reason we have\nseen a steady decline of fewer SBICs, because they have been\nable to access that capital a different way.\nSenator Romney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Rubio. Senator Cantwell.\nSenator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you\nagain for introducing legislation that is topical today to fix\nthis problem as it relates to women-owned businesses being\npenalized if they actually have equity investment from being\nable to participate in the SBA program. So I am assuming that\nyou agree that that is a good solution to fixing that problem.\nMr. Shepard. I am not sure what.\nSenator Cantwell. So currently if you are a woman-owned\nbusiness and you receive equity investment, they are saying\nthat that counts against your minority ownership. Look, we have\na major problem in America that women are underrepresented in\nour economy, and there are lots of reasons for that, but we\nneed to work a lot harder on this Committee to make sure that\naccess to capital, technical and skilled training, barriers\nthat are inhibitors to that, we change the law to allow women-\nowned businesses to be sole-source, contract-approved at the\nFederal level. For the first time, Federal Government made\ntheir threshold numbers. So capital importance of opportunity,\nthe Women's Centers, all these things are important to bringing\nup that number, which is a very low number.\nFrankly, my colleague, Senator Shaheen, and I, we like\nwomen as women-owned businesses because chances are they create\nproducts that we like and they are more geared toward the\nthings that we are interested in.\nBut the bottom line is we need half of our economy to be\nmore entrepreneurial, and to do that they have to have access\nto capital and changing this law so they are not penalized.\nThat was my question. Do you believe that we should continue to\nhelp women-owned businesses not be penalized under the Federal\nlaw?\nMr. Shepard. Absolutely. That should not be a barrier to\nentry in our economy, by any means.\nSenator Cantwell. And you support the Women Business\nCenters?\nMr. Shepard. Absolutely. They are a great product and one\nof the good things we have at SBA.\nSenator Cantwell. And do you agree that they are key tools,\nbecause again, part of some of the other programs that we have,\nagain, have been oriented more toward a lot of retired CEOs,\nand that is great, but again, women come in to pitch them on an\nidea that they have, and they do not have familiarity with what\nthe women are talking about--the market, the product, the\nsolution. And so the Women Business Centers of the SBA helps\nfund a really key tool for somebody to just show up in a\ncommunity and go, ``Where do I get started?''\nMr. Shepard. I agree. My mother was an entrepreneur when I\nwas young, and she could have really used those. And so there\nare a lot of women today benefiting from that Small Business\nAdministration resource, and it is a wonderful thing we have.\nSenator Cantwell. And the other thing we have figured out\nis they do not want to borrow as much as the guys want to\nborrow. They are just a little more--they did not want to\nborrow, you know, $500,000. They wanted to borrow smaller loan\namounts, so also achieving that.\nBut I want to, again, thank Chairman Rubio for co-\nsponsoring this legislation. I am hoping our colleagues will\nhelp support this so that that private sector investment will\nnot penalize women ownership from getting access to these\nFederal programs.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Rubio. Senator Kennedy.\nSenator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you--what\ndo I call you, Commissioner Shepard?\nMr. Shepard. Associate Administrator.\nSenator Kennedy. Administrator.\nMr. Shepard. Associate Administrator Shepard.\nSenator Kennedy. Okay. Thanks for being here today.\nMr. Shepard. Thank you, Senator Kennedy.\nSenator Kennedy. Why don't you like SBICs?\nMr. Shepard. I actually do.\nSenator Kennedy. Well, you know, one of the things that I\nhave learned since I have been up here--I have not been up here\nfor a while--but you have to watch what people do, not what\nthey say.\nMr. Shepard. Right.\nSenator Kennedy. So you have been Associate Director I\nthink two terms.\nMr. Shepard. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. And you are--while you are in office, the\naverage number of SBICs approved is 11.\nMr. Shepard. Mm-hmm.\nSenator Kennedy. When you are out of office, the average is\ndouble that.\nMr. Shepard. Mm-hmm.\nSenator Kennedy. That tells me you do not like them.\nMr. Shepard. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. Why is that?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. I do. I think in the Bush administration\nI was in that position for a little over a year----\nSenator Kennedy. Yes, and you averaged 11.\nMr. Shepard [continuing]. And we had the Great Recession,\nand we had a lot of funds that----\nSenator Kennedy. And you are averaging 11 now.\nMr. Shepard. And--and----\nSenator Kennedy. And the normal is 20.\nMr. Shepard. Mm-hmm.\nSenator Kennedy. I mean, if I am a small business woman or\nman, and let's say I have got an $8 million company----\nMr. Shepard. Right.\nSenator Kennedy [continuing]. But I have got promising new\nsoftware, and I go to SoftBank or Sequoia Capital and ask for\nmoney, they are not going to even see me, are they?\nMr. Shepard. Right. Right. Probably not. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. Okay?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. That is the purpose of an SBIC. Correct?\nMr. Shepard. Mm-hmm. In many instances, yes.\nSenator Kennedy. So let me ask you again, why don't you\nlike them?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. Yes. Well, I do. I absolutely do.\nSenator Kennedy. Well, then why don't you approve them?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. Well, we have been approving them.\nSenator Kennedy. Not very quickly.\nMr. Shepard. We are doing--we are doing as good a job as we\ncan. We can always do better.\nSenator Kennedy. Do you need more people, or do you----\nMr. Shepard. We may need--we may need more people.\nSenator Kennedy [continuing]. Or do your people just--I\nmean, it is not only that you are not approving them--and I am\nnot suggesting that your analysis should not be rigorous----\nMr. Shepard. Yes, sure.\nSenator Kennedy [continuing]. But when you are not in\noffice----\nMr. Shepard. Right.\nSenator Kennedy [continuing]. It seems to go much more\nquickly.\nMr. Shepard. Mm-hmm.\nSenator Kennedy. And it is not just the denial, it is the\ndelay.\nMr. Shepard. Right.\nSenator Kennedy. That is what most people hate about\ngovernment. It is the stall and restall.\nMr. Shepard. Sure.\nSenator Kennedy. I mean, if you continue going at the pace\nyou are going, the average age of your applicants for an SBIC\nlicense----\nMr. Shepard. Right.\nSenator Kennedy [continuing]. Is going to be deceased.\nMr. Shepard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. So what is the problem?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. Yes. Well, I think, you know, last year\nwe licensed 25, and we had a period of time where we actually\nlicensed faster than we had ever done before, in 5.1 months. We\nhad a lot of subsequent funds, so we licensed faster.\nWe are seeing more startup funds or new funds. Those take a\nlittle longer to process, and so that extends our licensing\ntime from five months to, say, seven months.\nSenator Kennedy. Well, but, isn't there a--I am sorry for\ninterrupting you but I have only got 5 minutes.\nMr. Shepard. Sure. Sure. I understand.\nSenator Kennedy. Rubio is tough.\nMr. Shepard. Yes, sir.\nSenator Kennedy. He is tough.\nMr. Shepard. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. But if you have got a brand-new license\napplication, but you have a lot of folks who have had one\nSBIC----\nMr. Shepard. Correct. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy [continuing]. And they are applying for a\nsecond one----\nMr. Shepard. Right.\nSenator Kennedy [continuing]. It would seem to me that the\nsecond one should go more quickly.\nMr. Shepard. We can move them faster.\nSenator Kennedy. No, you do not. No, you do not.\nMr. Shepard. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. It takes just as long, and in some cases,\nlonger, and I do not get it.\nMr. Shepard. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. I mean, to me there is a--yes, there is a\nlot of venture capital out there. There is venture capital all\nover hell and half of Georgia.\nMr. Shepard. Yes. Sure.\nSenator Kennedy. But unless you are a big girl or a big\nboy, you are not going to have access to any of it.\nMr. Shepard. Right.\nSenator Kennedy. That is what the SBIC is for.\nMr. Shepard. Right.\nSenator Kennedy. That is your job.\nMr. Shepard. Yes. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. Not once I do get an answer out of you\nguys, you just say, ``Denied,'' and I say, ``Why?''\nMr. Shepard. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. And you say, ``If I told you, I would have\nto kill you.''\nMr. Shepard. Yes. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. Why don't you tell people why you are\nlying to them?\nMr. Shepard. Well, we do.\nSenator Kennedy. No, you do not.\nMr. Shepard. We have----\nSenator Kennedy. Why isn't there an appeals process?\nMr. Shepard [continuing]. We--we--we have not had any\ndenials at the agency committee level.\nSenator Kennedy. Yes. It is because you do not give them an\nanswer.\nMr. Shepard. Well, we----\nSenator Kennedy. It is because you stall them and restall\nthem.\nMr. Shepard. Well, we--we--we answer them as quickly as\npossible at that level, and we have approved several at that\nlevel, and we have not had a lot of denials there. I think one\nof the things to keep in mind is we cannot force capital\nformation. They have to decide to apply----\nSenator Kennedy. Okay.\nMr. Shepard [continuing]. And----\nSenator Kennedy. I am about to run out of time and I want\nto land this plane on time.\nMr. Shepard. Understood.\nSenator Kennedy. Mr. Shepard, I do not know you. I know you\nare a fine person.\nMr. Shepard. Mm-hmm.\nSenator Kennedy. I do not think you like SBICs. Either that\nor you have got folks who just are not competent.\nMr. Shepard. Okay.\nSenator Kennedy. I think applicants deserve an answer when\nthey are denied. I think you should tell them why. I think that\nif you really do not support SBICs you are in the wrong job.\nMr. Shepard. Right. Understood. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. And it does not look to me like, based on\nyour behavior, you support them.\nMr. Shepard. OK.\nSenator Kennedy. Now I am not telling you, do not be\nrigorous in your analysis.\nMr. Shepard. Understood. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. This is taxpayer money.\nMr. Shepard. Right.\nSenator Kennedy. But I am telling you, I am suggesting to\nyou, if you have a bias against SBICs, you ought to go run for\nthe Senate or something.\nMr. Shepard. Right. Right.\nSenator Kennedy. But you should not be doing what you are\ndoing.\nMr. Shepard. Right. Well, I do like the program and would\nlook forward to visiting more with your staff about some of\nthese instances, and making sure that we clarify some things.\nSenator Kennedy. Thank you for your service.\nMr. Shepard. Thank you very much.\nChairman Rubio. Before I turn it over to Senator Shaheen I\nwant to just take on that, because I do not want to forget to\nbring it up. When we talked about the new models that you are\ngoing to be using to calculate the costs, it is going to\ninclude assumptions--I read them out already--macroeconomic\nfactors, private equity elements, private equity fund\ncharacteristics. And you initiated this new model.\nAre these assumptions that you are coming up with, are\nthose required by the Federal Credit Reform Act or the Office\nof Management and Budget?\nMr. Shepard. The Federal Credit Reform Act does speak to\nthe fact that you should have a model, that underlying model\nthat mimics the type of investment activity. And so that is\nwhat we are trying to do with this Federal Credit Program.\nChairman Rubio. Right. But the FCRA and the OMB only\nrequire the use of Treasury discount rates.\nMr. Shepard. Mm-hmm.\nChairman Rubio. That is the only ones they require. So\nthese are ones you chose.\nMr. Shepard. We are working on selecting them. They have\nnot been selected yet.\nChairman Rubio. But those are the ones you are leaning\ntoward choosing or using, correct?\nMr. Shepard. Yes, sir. Correct. And we will vet that with\nOMB and make sure that it is done right. There is no question\nabout that.\nChairman Rubio. Yes, and I guess, building on what Senator\nKennedy's question was, how is this evaluation of the program\nnot you substituting your own priorities for those that\nCongress has laid out?\nMr. Shepard. Oh, and it is not intended to be a\nsubstitution, by any means, Chairman. It is intended to do a\nbetter job of making sure that we secure taxpayer dollars and\nthat we do not have losses. So it is trying to improve the\nprogram to make it better from a loss standpoint.\nChairman Rubio. Senator Shaheen.\nSenator Shaheen. Well, just--my time needs to go back up to\nfive minutes.\nChairman Rubio. I do not even look at it so you can go\nahead. I do--only for Kennedy do I look at the time. Everybody\nelse----\nSenator Kennedy. You better watch Rubio.\nSenator Shaheen. I know. Really. Just to be clear, so that\nI understand what your response was to Senator Rubio, I\nunderstood you to say that the criteria that you have laid out\nare not criteria that are required by the law. Is that correct?\nMr. Shepard. I--we have--I am not sure about that. We have\nactually----\nSenator Shaheen. Well, can you get an answer for this\nCommittee?\nMr. Shepard. I absolutely can. Yes. Yes, ma'am.\nSenator Shaheen. Mr. Chairman, if you could share that\nanswer as soon as we get it, I would appreciate it.\nChairman Rubio. Sure. I think we know the answer but we are\nmore than happy to hear what----\nSenator Shaheen. I agree.\nMr. Shepard. Thank you.\nSenator Shaheen. So I guess I have to say, Mr. Shepard, I\nfound your responses to Senator Kennedy totally unacceptable,\nbecause the SBA's statistics show that the average licensing\ntimeline for SBICs rose to 8.2 months in 2017, from 5.1 months\nin 2016, and that the program has led new license requests to\ndecline from 29 in 2017, to just 17 in 2018.\nSo again, I do not know what has caused this, but I know\nthat you are in charge, and that the program is going in the\nwrong direction.\nMr. Shepard. Mm-hmm.\nSenator Shaheen. So I think it is incumbent on you to find\nout what is causing the decline in license requests and the\nincreasing timeline, so that we can fix that.\nMr. Shepard. Correct. Yes.\nSenator Shaheen. Because I agree with Senator Cantwell. As\nI have traveled around and looked at what is happening in the\neconomy right now, one of the things that we know is that\nwomen-owned businesses are increasing much more dramatically\nthan other businesses, women- and minority-owned businesses,\nand that they are employing people at a greater rate. And we\nalso know that women-owned businesses have a much harder time\ngetting access to capital.\nAnd so I guess what I want to know is what is SBA doing to\nmake clear to women and minorities that the SBIC program is\navailable to help reduce barriers to new entrants. So what are\nyou doing to reach out to women and minorities to ensure that\nthey understand that SBIC is something that they can\nparticipate in as well?\nMr. Shepard. Right. Well, there are two answers. The Small\nBusiness Investment Companies who actually make the investments\nare the ones that would be having the majority of the dialog\nwith those women-owned businesses and making investment\ndecisions about whether they are going to invest in them or\nnot.\nOn our side, in terms of licensing, it would be making sure\nthat the female fund investors can invest, using SBIC as a\nvehicle for an investment fund. And we have a few, but as I\nmentioned, Senator Cardin, we need more, and we do not have an\nissue with that at all. We just do not have very many female\nprospective fund managers that come in seeking an SBA license\nto operate an SBIC.\nSenator Shaheen. And so are there things that you think SBA\nmight do to encourage more women and minorities to be able to\ndo that?\nMr. Shepard. I think we could certainly improve in that\narea. Yes, ma'am.\nSenator Shaheen. And what kinds of things do you think\nmight be possible for SBA to do?\nMr. Shepard. I think we could maybe use some of our other\npartners within the SBA to communicate that message better, and\nalso use our education team that we have in-house within the\nSBIC program to have better outreach to those groups and those\nentities.\nSenator Shaheen. Well, I would certainly encourage you to\ndo that----\nMr. Shepard. I appreciate that.\nSenator Shaheen [continuing]. Because as we look at where\njob creation is happening, there are tremendous opportunities\nthere. And so I hope SBA will encourage the SBIC program to be\nmore inclusive.\nMr. Shepard. Yes, ma'am.\nSenator Shaheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Rubio. Seven minutes left. You did not need the\nreset.\nSenator Hawley.\nSenator Hawley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Shepard, I\nhave got to be honest with you. My office has heard a lot of\ncomplaints from SBICs about your process, and to be frank with\nyou about your leadership. And so like other members of this\nCommittee I think I am trying to get to the bottom of this. But\nwhen I say ``a lot,'' I mean a lot.\nSo was the SBIC approval process inadequate before you came\nto office? I mean, is that the issue here, that you have had to\nclean up? Is your position that we are approving way too many\nof these, and the whole thing needed to be overhauled?\nMr. Shepard. Not at all. I mean, there are certainly\nimprovements that need to be made, and I have put those in the\nwritten testimony, and before you got here talked a little bit\nabout some of those enhancements and improvements. But the\nintent is to make the program better and to streamline.\nSenator Hawley. So that explains why there has been a 50\npercent reduction in the approvals, in the way that Senator\nKennedy was asking?\nMr. Shepard. Just the processes alone should not account\nfor that. I think----\nSenator Hawley. So do you know--how many staff are in your\noffice?\nMr. Shepard. Total? We have got 82 is our count.\nSenator Hawley. So how many staff vacancies are in the\noffice?\nMr. Shepard. We have got 11. Eight are in the process of\nrecruitment and three are about ready to be recruited.\nSenator Hawley. What about senior management positions? Do\nyou have any of those that are unfilled?\nMr. Shepard. We have a deputy position that needs to be\nfilled. That is the only senior management.\nSenator Hawley. You know, a major complaint from the SBIC\nis the time it is taking to process applications, schedule\ninterviews, classes, even doing something as simple as actually\nsending a license to the applicant once they have been\napproved. What accounts for that? Are you not adequately\nstaffed? Is your staff not good at their job? I mean, what is\nthe--what are we to believe? What are we to conclude?\nMr. Shepard. Our staff is fantastic at their job, and they\nare wonderful people. And I think more of it, we could\ncertainly look at our personnel and look at our size.\nSenator Hawley. I mean, if your staff is really good at\ntheir job, but the program does not seem to be functioning, and\nthe processes are fine, I mean, what are we left to--I mean,\nwho is the weak link then? I mean, where does that leave us?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. The program has doubled in size, and so\nwe have got a lot more work to do. And so we are certainly--we\ncertainly could look at personnel and driving up those numbers.\nSenator Hawley. Why don't you give applicants who deny the\nopportunity, or who are denied approval, the opportunity to\namend their application, to account for whatever would have\ncaused the denial?\nMr. Shepard. I think unless--unless it is an issue of--\nunless it is some kind of a legal issue, I do not know why we\nwould not do that, and that is something I will look into with\nour team, because they certainly should have an opportunity to\nadjudicate or to come back around and have a fuller discussion.\nSenator Hawley. It just seems strange that after applicants\nspend who knows how many hours--tens, hundreds of thousands of\ndollars, raising millions of dollars in private capital,\nseeking a license, that you do not give them either the\ncourtesy of an explanation, to Senator Kennedy's point, or the\nopportunity to fix their application. I mean, that seems\nstrange to me. Don't you think so?\nMr. Shepard. I would agree, and I need to look into more of\nwhy that may be happening and some of those areas where that is\nhappening.\nSenator Hawley. Let me ask you something else. In December\n2018, Chairman Rubio's Spurring Business in Communities Act\nbecame law. I was not here then but that is an important bill\nto me, because it gives first priority to SBIC applicants who\nare located in under-licensed states like mine, like the State\nof Missouri, and it removes certain capital requirements to\nmake it easier for applicants from underserved states like mine\nto participate in the program.\nSo that was over six months ago. Where are we on\nimplementation?\nMr. Shepard. We are close and we are going to have it done\nby the end of the fiscal year, so in this next quarter.\nSenator Hawley. So when can I expect to see results in\nMissouri small business investment as a result of your\nimplementation?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. I think at the beginning of the next\nfiscal year, starting in that first quarter, we will start\npromoting that and talking about that program.\nSenator Hawley. So you have taken steps toward\nimplementation?\nMr. Shepard. Oh, absolutely.\nSenator Hawley. Yes. For example?\nMr. Shepard. Well, we have taken steps toward finalizing\nthe legislation, and we are starting to plan outreach to talk\nabout and announce it.\nSenator Hawley. Wait. Okay, wait. So you are starting to\nplan outreach. So you have not actually done any\nimplementation?\nMr. Shepard. We have an event in Oklahoma planned in\nAugust, to talk about--to talk about the underserved and the\nunder-licensed.\nSenator Hawley. Okay. So that will be your first event.\nMr. Shepard. Yes, sir.\nSenator Hawley. So so far you have not done anything.\nMr. Shepard. So far what, sir?\nSenator Hawley. So far you have not done anything. You said\nin August. This is June.\nMr. Shepard. Oh, this is outreach, outreach about the\nprogram. We are close to implementation and should have that\ndone in about----\nSenator Hawley. So you have not done any implementation\nyet?\nMr. Shepard. No implementation yet. No, sir.\nSenator Hawley. Okay.\nMr. Shepard. Yes.\nSenator Hawley. You know, are you aware that Committee\nstaff invited several SBIC fund managers to testify here today\nbut none agreed to do so, for fear of reprisal from you?\nMr. Shepard. I did not know that, and that----\nSenator Hawley. Don't you think that is alarming?\nMr. Shepard. It is unfortunate.\nSenator Hawley. What accounts for that?\nMr. Shepard. I do not know. I do not know. That should not\nbe the case, but I do not know.\nSenator Hawley. No, it should not be the case. What should\nwe do about that, do you think?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. I do not know. They should be here. I\nwould like them to be here. I would like us to have a good\nconversation with those SBIC fund managers.\nSenator Hawley. Hm. Have you ever delayed or denied the\nprocessing of an applicant as a form of punishment or reprisal?\nMr. Shepard. Absolutely not.\nSenator Hawley. You are sure about that?\nMr. Shepard. I am pretty sure. Yes, sir. I do not know why\nanyone would ever----\nSenator Hawley. You are pretty sure or you are 100 percent\nsure?\nMr. Shepard. I am 100 percent sure I----\nSenator Hawley. And you are--you are----\nMr. Shepard [continuing]. Would not do that.\nSenator Hawley. Okay. You are on the record and you are\nunder oath.\nMr. Shepard. Understood. Yes, sir.\nSenator Hawley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Rubio. I guess, I know it has been a tough\nhearing. You can hear some of the pushback and I would just\ncomment, you know, we read through some of this and you sort of\nsee some of the language--we see the performance, and we see\nsort of in your testimony and this discussion about providing\nsort of private equity-type structures and metrics to the\nprogram moving forward as a way to justify sort of why the\nprogram is not delivering the same numbers as it did in the\npast or historically has done, and sort of couched in the sense\nthat we want accountability for taxpayer dollars.\nBut I think one of the reasons why this program exists is\nthe acknowledgment or the belief by members of Congress that\nprivate equity--I think this problem has gotten worse--\nfundamentally undervalues innovation. And so you see these buzz\nwords like private equity to justify the reduced activity and I\nget concerned, I personally do, you know.\nAnd I think one of the trends we have seen is the\nfinalization of our companies, particularly the management of\ncompanies, has come into being. You have seen less investment\nin things that have a longer life, for example physical assets\nlike equipment or machines or plants or even research and\ndevelopment. Industrial innovation has paid a price, in my view\nanyways, as we financialize corporate governance and corporate\ndecisionmaking. At some point, the financial markets concluded\nthat it was just too risky to invest in these sorts of things\nanymore.\nAnd so it would be ironic if the very program that was\ndesigned to help small business overcome financialization of\nthese decisions was financialized itself.\nAnd so when we add what we have heard from you today, these\nnew metrics that are being designed, with the numbers that we\nhave seen and some of the other things that have been brought\nup, I think you understand that this Committee is pretty--for\nlack of a scientific term--fired up about not just the\ndirection this program is going but our view as to the\ndirection it is being taken.\nAnd I hope that came across today. It certainly did for me.\nMr. Shepard. Yes, sir.\nChairman Rubio. I do not know if the ranking member has\nanything to add.\nSenator Cardin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nMr. Shepard, I think there is a general consensus here on a\ncouple of things. First, we like the SBIC program. Democrats,\nRepublicans, small businesses, we like the SBIC program.\nSecondly, we are not satisfied with the time it takes for\nan application to be received and the numbers that are being\napproved and the outreach to underserved communities not having\ninvestors.\nI would point out, you indicated that the program has\ngrown. Our information shows that actually there was a\nreduction in the total funds in the SBIC from fiscal year 2017\nto fiscal year 2018. It actually went down.\nSo that is unacceptable. When you look at the total volume\ntoday, it is about what it was four years ago. So it is not the\ntype of growth that we would have expected in the SBIC program.\nSo this is a hearing on reauthorization. There is something\nnot working. If it is the law, let us know how we need to\nchange the law so Congress can give you the tools you need\nthrough statute. If it is the way that your agency is organized\nand the resources that you are getting, let us know that so\nthat we can deal with it. If it is a matter of capacity in your\nagency, we need to know that also. That is our responsibility\non oversight.\nBut the bottom line is this is a very important program. It\nis not meeting the expectations that we have set for it in\ntotal availability and it is not fairly distributed among all\nof the communities that need small business financing.\nSo this is an opportunity for you to present to us ways\nthat we can improve the law and give you the tools you need\nbecause you have bipartisan support for this program. So I\nwould just urge you to take advantage of that and get that\ninformation to this committee.\nMr. Shepard. We will do so and appreciate that, Senator.\nThank you.\nChairman Rubio. Senator Hawley, anything else?\nSenator Hawley. No.\nChairman Rubio. Thank you. Thanks for being here today. We\nare going to transition to the second panel. Again, our\napologies for the late start.\nI will introduce the second panel as they come up. It will\nbuy us some time here.\nBrett Palmer is the President of the Small Business\nInvestor Alliance.

Pretty good.\nChairman Rubio. I like getting names right.\nOzkazanc-Pan----\nMs. Ozkazanc-Pan. Ozkazanc-Pan.\nChairman Rubio.

Mr. Palmer,\nthank you, and the floor is yours.\nSTATEMENT OF BRETT PALMER, PRESIDENT, SMALL BUSINESS INVESTOR\nALLIANCE, WASHINGTON, DC\nMr. Palmer. Thank you, Chairman Rubio.\nMy name is Brett Palmer. I am President of the Small\nBusiness Investor Alliance.\nI would like to thank the Chairman, the Ranking Member, and\nthe other Senators participating today for taking part in this\nhearing, for reviewing the Small Business Investment Company\nprogram, discussing small business investment generally, and\nanswering any questions you may have about it.\nThe SBIA is the trade association of small business\ninvestors that includes the SBIC industry. The goal of the SBIA\nis to promote a healthy ecosystem for small business investing,\none that benefits both small businesses and their investors,\nand thereby promoting economic growth and job creation.\nSmall business investment companies have been around since\n1958. And what was true in the 1950s will always be true. Small\nbusinesses need external capital to grow and to thrive and to\nreach the next level. And it is really hard to access that type\nof capital.\nDebenture and non-levered SBICs have increased the amount\nof small business investment capital, with over $28 billion\ninvested domestically over the last five years. All SBIC\ninvestments must be used exclusively for domestic small\nbusinesses with at least 25 of those investments going to\nsmaller enterprises, which is a smaller standard than the small\nbusiness standard.\nSBICs cannot be used for an investment for short-term\nprojects and cannot be used for moving jobs offshore. By law,\nSBICs are focused on America.\nSBICs provide an important national benefit because SBICs\nare often the first institutional capital into small\nbusinesses. SBICs help with not only capital but also expert\nadvice on how to scale up and professionalize as a company\ngrows.\nSBICs invest across a broad range of industries and across\na broad range of geographies. It is common to see investment in\nmanufacturing and other not so flashy industries and in low and\nmoderate income areas, as well as parts of the country\ngenerally overlooked or flown over.\nIn contrast, venture investment is extremely concentrated\nand a lot of private equity investment is also concentrated.\nSBICs invest in a far, far more broader footprint. This is one\nof the reasons why we need more SBICs and we need them in more\nplaces.\nThe SBIC program has a very strong taxpayer protection\nsystem built into the system. It is maintained at zero subsidy\nnow, the SBIC debenture program, for about 22 years since\nCongress reformed in the late 1990s.\nThe SBIC program continues to have some of the healthiest\nand strongest payback period in its 60-year history. The annual\ncharge that Chairman Rubio mentioned is a fee that covers\npotential losses to the program. It is at its lowest rate in 60\nyears. The SBIC leverage has continued to operate that zero\nsubsidy and we expect that to continue.\nThere is a strong private sector interest in investing in\nsmall businesses, and particularly via Small Business\nInvestment Companies, which is critical because the private\nsector is the leading component to make the program work. This\nis not a subsidy program. It is not a grant program. It is not\na prop up failing businesses program. It is a market driven\nprogram where market forces are aligned with a clear public\nbenefit of more jobs, more innovation, and more geographic\ndispersion of opportunity.\nA 2017 Library of Congress study, which you all have\nmentioned, highlighted that the SBIC program has backed\nbusinesses that created 3 million jobs and support an\nadditional 6.5 million jobs over the 20 year period, an\nincredibly efficient rate to the taxpayer. This study was\nperformed by researchers from Duke and Pepperdine's Business\nSchool.\nYour average debenture-backed SBIC business added 125 new\njobs. Non-levered and equity oriented SBICs created over 530\nnew jobs per small business. That is an average, that is not\nuniversal for each one. But to put that into perspective, over\nthe 20-year period of the study, that represents about 7\npercent of the net new jobs in the United States from SBIC-\nbacked businesses. That is an extraordinary number for a little\nknown program, but that is what it is supposed to do.\nMost of these companies will never even consider going\npublic. They will never be written about in the Wall Street\nJournal. But they almost all grow, changing lives and\nsupporting communities.\nAll of these quiet little business successes add up to\nsomething big, which is the reason the SBIC program has broad\nbipartisan support. The SBIC program is good, but it is not\nperfect and there are limits to any government program. Every\ngovernment program can benefit from congressional oversight,\nregular reforms and updates, and we thank you for having this\nhearing.\nWe welcome the oversight and we want to work with Congress\nto make improvements. There are still significant market gaps\nthat are leaving too many small businesses unable to grow due\nto a lack of capital.\nMy written testimony, which is far more robust than you see\nfrom normal congressional testimony--it is almost a phone book\nthat you see before you--is broken into three categories\nbecause it is an unusual program. It is a plain English of how\nthe program works, is the first section.\nThe second section is ideas for improving the operation of\nthe program and for using the program to shrink what is\ncommonly called the ``valley of death'' because there are still\na lot of businesses that are good businesses that are not able\nto access the capital they need to access that next level.\nAnd third, and regrettably, is a sampling of the profoundly\nfrustrating dumbfounding mismanagement that is creating\nunnecessary risks and cutting off of capital to small\nbusinesses.\nI would like to thank Senator Rubio, Coons and others here\nfor their efforts to be thoughtful and deliberate about\nmanufacturing in particular, and we would like to see an\ninternational policy as we compete globally against the Chinese\nand others to really create that long-term investing.\nI would be happy to answer any of your questions.\nI would also mention, with the few seconds I have left,\nthat I would like, if the chance presents itself, to respond to\nsome of the questions directed to the first witness that I\nthink, frankly, need significantly more fleshing out to give a\nfull picture of the truth.\nBut with that, I would hand it over to Mr. Muro.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Palmer follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nChairman Rubio. Mr. Muro.\nSTATEMENT OF MARK MURO, SENIOR FELLOW AND POLICY DIRECTOR,\nMETROPOLITAN POLICY PROGRAM, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION, WASHINGTON,\nDC\nMr. Muro. Thank you, Chairman Rubio, Ranking Member Cardin,\nmembers of the Committee who I assume will see this material\notherwise. Thank you for inviting me today.\nMy expertise revolves around what my group at Brookings\nInstitution calls America's advanced industry sector. More on\nthat in just a sec.\nBut I want to suggest how the SBIC could be better\npositioned to support those industries that our particular\nindustry claims we need to talk about. Specifically, I want to\nurge that the committee explicitly prioritize advanced\nmanufacturing enterprises when it revisits the SBIC's\nactivities in the coming months.\nNot all industries matter equally. Indeed, these high-\nproductivity, high-pay innovation industries anchor American\ncompetitiveness, and matter inordinately. We need to think\nabout them and nudge the SBA's and the SBIC's services and\nresources toward support of those.\nWhat are advanced industries? Why do they matter? Brookings\ndefines these industries as those in which the R&D spending per\nworker reaches the top 20 percent of all industries and the\nshare of workers with significant STEM knowledge exceeds the\nnational average.\nWe count three energy, 12 service industries, and 35\nmanufacturing industries. This super sector is dominated by\nstrong advanced manufacturing. Among these 35 manufacturing\nindustries is automaking, aerospace, pharma, medical devices,\ncomputers, semiconductors, chemicals and their huge supply\nchains.\nWhy do they matter so much? The advance industries sector\nencompasses much of the nation's most crucial economic\nactivity. It anchors the traded sector, generates above average\nproductivity, and supports long supply chains. It spreads\ninnovation because its inordinate R&D spending drives product\nand process innovation, both within enterprises and then\nthrough spillovers throughout the economy.\nAnd then this group of industries I am talking about train\nand employ the nation's STEM workforce. They find them, they\nlocate them, they hire them, they train them both engineering\ntalent but also non-BA technical workers, what we call blue\ncollar STEM.\nWe can go over a few of the statistics here. They are\ndelivering value, these industries. Advanced industries perform\n90 percent of the private sector R&D in our country.\nAdvanced industries, including advanced manufacturing, are\nextraordinarily productive. Each worker generated approximately\n$250,000 worth of output last year, twice the amount of the\nother sectors.\nAnd advanced industries punch way above their weight in\ngenerating our GDP, $3.7 trillion worth of output, 18 percent\nsignificant. Advanced manufacturing, about 40 percent of that.\nThe bottom line is this, without a competitive advanced\nsector, it is going to be simply not possible for the U.S. to\nmaintain global preeminence, sustained prosperity, and renew\nnational unity. So I want to bring that national imperative\ninto this discussion.\nBut here is the problem, as we have been hearing, there is\nnow abundant evidence that the primacy of America's advanced\nindustries, and especially its advanced manufacturing sectors\nbeing contested and eroding. Slipping U.S. R&D investments, low\nSTEM graduating production, thinning of manufacturing\necosystems is our problem.\nSo we are going to need to intervene here. But the\nchallenge of finance is a very real additional challenge.\nInherent biases of VC and capital resources skew the existing\nsmall firm financing system away from these capital intensive\nmanufacturing enterprises.\nThere is a role to intervene here. Policy should address\nthis.\nThe SBIC is clearly a useful tool for some of this work and\nshould be further enabled to assist advanced manufacturing\nconcerns in the coming years.\nThe lack of sectoral specificity in the program and in loan\nmaking means that public funds are not always maybe channeled\nto the highest and best use in this national purpose.\nAnd then we have heard about the repayment structure which\nbegins immediately and is comprised of an SBA annual charge\nplus interest due, just simply is not conducive to the nature\nof the long-term product development timelines that advanced\nmanufacturing firms require.\nSo I endorse several of the ideas that I think are being\ndiscussed. Explicit prioritization of advanced manufacturing\ngrowth makes a ton of sense and the Committee could provide for\nmore robust and patient capital in SBIC funding.\nThe SBA should adopt an ethos of investing in the national\ninterest here. It is not just a technical matter. The national\ninterest needs to enter this discussion and I think this\nCommittee has been strong on that.\nAmerica's medium- and long-term competitiveness will be\nheavily influenced by its success in expanding these advanced\nindustries. Success or failure will be determined, meanwhile,\nby our choices--something I think you have written about--and\nwhat we choose to do and not to do in a world of great\ncompetition.\nSo I think working to improve the availability of patient\ncapital for smaller advanced manufacturing firms would be a\ngood choice.\nSo thank you again for having me.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Muro follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nChairman Rubio. Dr. Pan.\nSTATEMENT OF BANU OZKAZANC-PAN, PhD., ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF\nMANAGEMENT, UMASS BOSTON AND VISITING ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF\nSOCIOLOGY, BROWN UNIVERSITY, BOSTON, MA\nMs. Ozkazanc-Pan. Thank you.\nChairman Rubio, Ranking Member Cardin, and Members of the\nCommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify here today.\nIn addition to my very long title, I am the founding\ndirector of the Venture Capital Inclusion Lab at Brown\nUniversity and happy to speak further about some of the work\nthat we are doing.\nToday, I will provide a broad overview of the VC industry\nand then go on to discuss the specifics as they relate to women\nand minorities.\nThe VC industry last year saw record growth in investments.\nLast year, the industry invested around $130.9 billion across\n8,948 deals and raised $55.5 billion across 256 funds,\nrepresenting record amounts compared to the dot com boom era.\nDuring this time, around 62 percent of total invested\ncapital was due to deals sized $50 million or larger. VC mega-\nfunds, or those raising $500 million or more, accounted for 57\npercent of all capital raised. These large funds were partially\nsupported by the involvement of private equity and corporate VC\ninvestments.\nDuring this time, we saw that both deal size and valuations\ngrow, particularly in early stages. Right now, $25 million\ndeals or larger now represent almost 62 percent of all early\nstage deals by value. However, whether the pace of such\ninvestment activity is sustainable continues and needs to be\nseen.\nThere is some concern about the amount of available capital\nand whether it is being deployed efficiently. In addition, the\nmajority of VC investments go to pharma, biotech, and software\nindustries with software representing the largest single sector\nfor VC money.\nDespite the growth of VC investments, the situation for\nwomen and minorities is quite different. On the investor side,\na 2017 report by TechCrunch found that women represented 8\npercent of all partners in top 100 VC firms. Only 1 percent of\nsurvey's 713 VC firms had Black decisionmakers, coming out with\na whopping 7 individuals, while Hispanic decisionmakers were\nrepresented at 1.5 percent and Asians at 24 percent. Overall,\n85 percent of decisionmakers in the U.S. VC industry are male\nand 73 percent are white.\nOn the entrepreneur side, less than 1 percent of Black\nwomen receive VC funding and startups with a female CEO have\nreceived only 2.7 percent of all VC money.\nWe see that all male teams represent 82 percent of all VC-\nbacked startups. Blacks represent 1 percent, Latinos around 2\npercent, and Asians around 18 percent. In general, Whites\nrepresent about 77 percent of all VC-backed companies.\nDespite these challenging facts, 40 percent of all current\nbusinesses in the U.S. are women-owned. These businesses have\nbeen growing at impressive rates. Between 2007 and 2018, women-\nowned businesses grew at 58 percent compared to 12 percent\ngrowth across all businesses. Women of color-owned businesses\ngrew an impressive 163 percent during the same time.\nDespite this growth, revenues generated by women of color-\nowned businesses have dropped between 2007 and 2018 by 21\npercent, whereas non-minority-owned business revenue grew by\n17. Research shows that if revenues generated by minority\nwomen-owned businesses matched those currently generated by all\nwomen-owned businesses, they would add 4 million additional\njobs and $1.4 trillion in revenues to the U.S. economy.\nSimilarly, if minority-owned businesses were at\nentrepreneurial parity, the U.S. would gain 1.9 million firms,\n13.2 million more employees, and an additional $2.9 trillion in\ngross receipts.\nThe challenges are taking place at a historic moment. The\nU.S. is changing in terms of demography and this will mean new\nconsumers, markets, and opportunities will emerge. At the same\ntime, increased global competition requires investments to make\nthe U.S. economy strong and competitive.\nSBICs can provide these investments and can be even\nstronger in terms of employment and job creation.\nNew programs, such as on-ramps for women and minority fund\nmanagers and investors can boost the already better than\nindustry numbers for gender and racial diversity in SBICs. They\ncan allow expanded deal flow options and networks and move away\nfrom some of the group think and pattern matching that allowed\nthe VC industries to fund companies like Theranos. They can\ntake advantage of new customer segments and consumer needs that\ncan be served through diverse firms.\nBy investing in industries beyond those associated with\ntraditional VC funding, we can build a sufficiently diversified\neconomy. And by continuing to fill the gaps in capital\nresulting from mega-deals in the VC community, we can expand\nopportunity across geography, gender, and race.\nThank you.\n[The prepared statement of Ms. Ozkazanc-Pan follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nChairman Rubio. Thank you.\nLet me start here. Mr. Palmer, you have been the president\nof the association that represents the SBIC companies for many\nyears now, right?\nMr. Palmer. Eleven years, yes.\nChairman Rubio. So before this hearing, we tried to get\nfund managers to come testify. We could not get a single person\nto come and tell us about their experience. Why will not--\nSenator Hawley touched on it pretty extensively. Why are they\nnot here today? Why will they not come?\nMr. Palmer. Well, there are some that had legitimate\nbusiness conflicts, but there is legitimate fear. The Associate\nAdministrator is well known to the industry. His style is one\nthat certainly leaves significant open questions. The fund\nmanagers believe they have a fiduciary duty to their investors\nand they are afraid of retaliation where there are so many\nsteps in the process that are judgment calls that if they go\nagainst you, you have got a big problem. And they feel that\nthey cannot, in good faith to their investors, speak publicly\nlest they put their investors at risk.\nChairman Rubio. The bottom line is that there are members\nof your organization, these investment companies, who feel that\nif they come testify before the elected representatives of the\nU.S. Senate about the status of the program and how it is\nworking, that they are going to get hurt, that there will be\ndecisions made on the margins that is going to harm them and\nultimately put in danger their obligation to their investors.\nThey are afraid to come----\nMr. Palmer. Yes.\nChairman Rubio [continuing]. Because they are afraid they\nare going to be retaliated against.\nMr. Palmer. Yes, and though it is difficult to quantify\nthose judgment decisions, there have been events that have\nhappened in the past that they look at, and on the face of it,\nsay that to me looks like retaliation for not hiring him or\nspeaking out against him previously and we just do not feel\nthat we have--they will do it privately. And it is a challenge\nbecause there is--being in the sunshine is important. But they\nhave an obligation and they are legitimately scared. I tried to\ntalk to them.\nChairman Rubio. And I raise this without him being here and\nable to respond because he was asked the question directly\nearlier.\nMr. Palmer. Right.\nChairman Rubio. So we have now on the record his response\nto that question and we have your statement here, so that\nSenator Hawley's comments do not just stand on their own but we\nnow have a representative of the association.\nDr. Pan, there is, as you know, the requirement--the SBA\nessentially requires that an SBIC applicant have two fund\nmanagers. They have to both have previous experience and\nexpertise with the program.\nI have drafted a proposal that would allow applicants to\nhave a single fund manager with the experience and provide SBA\ntraining to applicants whose management team has no previous\nexperience with the program.\nMy question is do you believe this provision could help\nexpand the pool of potential fund managers? And would this kind\nof proposal help to increase diversity in the venture capital\nand private equity communities?\nMs. Ozkazanc-Pan. Thank you for your question, Mr. Rubio.\nI do believe these are good first steps to ensure that\nthere is opportunities available for women and minority fund\nmanagers, and sometimes experience and exposure could be one\nway in which they feel left out. So I think a program like\nthis, with additional elements, could be very beneficial to\ndiversifying SBIC fund managers.\nMr. Palmer. I can give you a case of that that is exactly\ntrue. The past chairwoman of my board, Carolyn Galiette with\nIronwood Capital, she will tell you point blank that she would\nnever have gotten licensed today--even though she is on her\nthird or fourth license--if they had the standards now in place\nfor licensure that she had back then. And her fund invests, by\ndesign, more than half of her investments are in women,\nminorities and low-income areas as a top tier firm.\nChairman Rubio. Mr. Muro, I wanted to sort of lead into the\nquestion with the following statement. There is two orthodoxies\nthat have been in place for some time which frankly, I have\ndealt with and confronted and, in some cases, at some point\npotentially even supported in some of the decisions.\nThe two orthodoxies are these: the first is that there is a\nvery limited role for government to play writ large across\neverything. And I am a person who believes in limited\ngovernment. But that the bottom line is the private market will\ndetermine what is a good idea or not a good idea, particularly\nin the role of investment.\nAnd the second orthodoxy is that we are headed into an era\nthat is good for us, in which we would innovate here but then\nmake things somewhere else. And then we would be on the high\nend and let someone else make it. We will innovate the\nsoftware, we will innovate the ideas, and then someone else\nwill build it and that is better for the U.S. consumer.\nThese are the two orthodoxies.\nThe problem with the first one, that first one, is that\ninvestment today, it is my view but I think it is supported and\nthe report we put out earlier this highlights this, the\nfinancialization of so much of our corporate and business\nactivity in this country has driven investment decisions toward\nhow can I get the highest return for the lowest risk in the\nshortest amount of time? That is what is being rewarded and\nthat is what is driving investment decisions.\nSo that is the first problem with simply saying the private\nmarket will take care of it, is that when you do that, when\nyour focus is on how can I get the highest return in the\nshortest amount of time with the lowest amount of risk, you are\nnot going to invest in research and development. You are not\ngoing to invest in innovation. It may be the greatest idea in\nhistory or it may be a total flop.\nAnd that is problematic because of the second point. And\nthat is this notion that we are going to invent things here but\nthey are going to be made somewhere else will not last forever.\nSo there is a lot of noise out there about Huawei. What people\nare missing about Huawei and telecommunications is an important\npiece but it is just one piece of a much broader strategy in\nwhich China, as an example, has used the government support of\nits national champion companies to establish dominance in a\nseries of critical fields to the 21st century.\nSo how it works is you are one of these companies. You have\ngovernment-backed credit. You have a guaranteed protection in\nthe domestic marketplace. So here is a billion people that only\nyou can sell to. Plus, we are going to give you money.\nSo what do these companies do? They can now go abroad in\nrail cars. They can flood the market with batteries or\nrobotics. And no one can compete with them until none of their\ncompetitors exist and they have created a dominance in that\nindustry.\nAnd so I wanted you to address--the first point, I think,\nis well established and you can talk about it. But it is the\nsecond one that I want people to understand, that what is\nflowing away from us in the 21st century will eventually be the\ninnovation, as well. But there is a value, an inherent value,\nin the jobs that are created as a national priority in those\nindustries that we are going to have to have a response to.\nWe are going to have to have a collective national\nresponse--that does not have to be partisan, by the way--on\nChina's industrial policy. Because we are not competing with\nbusinesses like ours. We are competing with national champions\nbacked by the government of the soon to be largest economy, not\nper capita but gross largest economy in the world with\nextraordinary market resources that are going to, in essence,\nleave us in a world where their companies will dominate all of\nthese fields at the same time as the financialization of our\ncorporate and investment decisions is leading us further and\nfurther away from the kinds of things we need to do to compete\nagainst them.\nSo I told you it was a long question.\nMr. Muro. Yes, I think you are pointing to some of the most\ncritical issue we are facing. We know there are market failures\non market irregularities and how resources flow at home. What\nhas happened, I think, is that we are realizing that by\nallowing, by failing to support some of these sectors, they are\nflowing offshore on their production end and it is no longer\nsimply a choice between innovation and production.\nMore and more, we are learning that innovation requires\nspecific inputs and detailed iterative knowhow. And even the\naccumulation of knowledge in specific regions that become\nwarehouses of knowledge. So we have to manage and protect those\nbecause you can lose--there are many examples, solar PV cells,\nelectric motors, rare earth elements, LEDs, many others, where\nwe thought we were just off-shoring the production and pretty\nsoon it turned out that we were losing control and leadership\nin the creativity.\nAnd it is because innovation is not a high-flown purely\nintellectual activity. It is about small, embedded iterative\nproduct iterations and process improvements. We have to be able\nto manufacture so that we can innovate.\nAnd I think that logic has gotten somewhat skewed. I think\nthe innovation has gotten associated simply with digital\ninnovation and we have lost track of how things actually are\ncreated in plants.\nChairman Rubio. And I will turn it over to the Ranking\nMember, other than to say that even in the digital space that\nis true. So the platform known as the internet and all of the\ntransactions that take place in it has spawned a bunch of\ninnovation. One of them is mobile payment, right? Today, China\nhas--you could argue that we innovated the platform upon which\nit is occurring. But the innovation and the application of it,\nwhen it comes to mobile payment, they lead the world both in\nadopting it but also in all of the technologies that are\nrelated to it.\nSo at some point in the future, when all of these other\ncompanies around the world want to go on a mobile payment\nsystem because that is what everyone is doing, they will\ncontrol--even in the digital space--that industry and the\ntechnologies that drive it. The 5G is another example.\nThe Ranking Member.\nSenator Cardin. Let me thank all of our witnesses.\nThis has been certainly an interesting hearing, a little\nbit livelier than most of our hearings. But the focus is on the\nreauthorization of Congress of the SBIC programs. As I said in\nthe beginning, this is our seventh hearing on reauthorization\nof parts of the SBA.\nSo I just really would like to get your views, I hope we\ncould get some short answers. But the SBIC program, you all\nbelieve is an important tool available for small businesses?\nMr. Palmer. Yes.\nSenator Cardin. And it appears, from the way that you have\npresented your testimony in response to the Chairman's\nquestion, that it is not doing everything it should be doing\ntoday. Is that a fair enough statement?\nMr. Palmer. Not as much as it could be doing. I mean,\npeople are trying. It is just a question of there are barriers\nto being as successful as it could be.\nSenator Cardin. Are those barriers statutory or is it the\nway it is being administered?\nMr. Palmer. There are several. There is clearly a\nmismanagement problem and a hostility in the functioning of the\nprogram. I do not say that lightly and I do not say that\nwithout evidence. I have got a book in front of me where you\ncan document that.\nBut I think there is also, for the risk aversion of the\nprogram, as far as the ability to make sure that it has zero\nsubsidy, also really minimizes risk. And so as you minimize\nrisk, it takes it away from some of the earlier stage side. And\nI think it is time to really look more aggressively, what can\nwe be doing to make that valley of death smaller, to allow for\nmore equity, more patient capital, more manufacturing, some\nearlier stage businesses that are not quite as good.\nThere are a number of things we need to be looking at to\nfigure out some new tools to make sure we can do that.\nSenator Cardin. So was the early stage capital sabotaged to\nnot work? Because it seems to me early stage capital would deal\nwith some of the issues that we have all been talking about,\nand it was started and stopped.\nMr. Palmer. Well, there is several different versions of\nearly stage that they have done. There was an Early Stage\nprogram that was done around 2012 or thereabouts that actually\nworked. They only licensed five funds.\nThe biggest problem they had with it is that you could only\nget licensed once a year. So you were in, and if they had a\nquestion you were out. And so you had to go back and forth a\nlittle bit. You have to wait another year. And private sector\nwill not wait a year to raise a fund.\nSo that could be popped up tomorrow with the regulations\nreactivated and all they have to do is go to a rolling\nlicensure. That would work and that operates at zero taxpayer\nsubsidy.\nThe participating securities program was a program that ran\nfrom 1994 to 2004, that was extraordinarily good at creating\nearly stage capital investment, it was $21 billion. But it also\nlost about $1 billion or $1.5 billion because of the cockamamie\npayback structure.\nThe SBA has internal models of what they could have done to\nfix that and that really could have been fixed and reformed\nwith some very modest changes. That could work again, but you\nwould have to make those changes because if you do not protect\nthe taxpayer you have a problem.\nBut that was why that changed.\nSenator Cardin. And it could have been changed----\nMr. Palmer. It absolutely could have.\nSenator Cardin [continuing]. By the SBA?\nMr. Palmer. That could have been changed--this is going\nback to the mid-2000s, before my time so I was there post. But\nI believe some of that could have been done by the\nadministration, which I was in, full disclosure. But some of it\nwould have required some congressional changes, if I recall.\nSenator Cardin. So it appears like, what I have heard from\ntoday's hearing, it is not so much the fundamental law that has\nbeen passed by Congress, but the way the law is being\nimplemented?\nMr. Palmer. Yes.\nSenator Cardin. It is not reaching its full potential. It\nis working but it is not working as well as it could work.\nMr. Palmer. Right. And I think one of the things--you heard\na lot about risk from the first witness. What you never heard\nwas reward. Reward is a critical element to risk. We have to\ntake risk. We are trying to facilitate risk. We are trying to\nfacilitate the private sector to take risks that they might not\notherwise have taken that are not irrational risks but that are\nproperly incentivized without subsidy.\nAnd we have to be not paralyzed by risk but actually figure\nout how to do that.\nSenator Cardin. No question, small businesses always\npresent a risk. We know that.\nMr. Palmer. Right.\nSenator Cardin. So we recognize if you do not take risks,\nyou are not going to make progress.\nThe Chairman mentioned, I thought, a very good point on\nminority participation--professor, I want to get you engaged in\nthis--about the fund managers and the experience of the fund\nmanagers, and that can be used to as a way to prevent outreach\nin underserved communities if you set up such high standards\nthat communities do not have representation in the funds\nthemselves, in the investors themselves.\nAre there other recommendations that you would make so that\nwe can get more participation from women, from minorities in\nunderserved communities?\nMs. Ozkazanc-Pan. Absolutely. And I would be happy to work\nwith respective staffs for solutions, given some of my research\nand some of the findings around best practices.\nOne of the things we have seen work are fellowships or\napprenticeships that are funded. Sometimes they are matched,\nsometimes they are fully funded. But this allows women and\nminorities who may not have the financial background to enter\ninto the fund manager position, to gain that experience and\nexposure.\nThere is a venture fellows program at a new venture capital\nfirm that has placed their first fellow into another VC firm.\nSo there are examples across the board of firms doing things\nright.\nAnd lastly, just as a followup, at the VC Inclusion Lab, we\nare actually following up with each of the 40-plus firms that\nsigned the National Venture Capital Association diversity\npledge in 2014, to see what they have done and what changes\nthey have seen. So I would be able to give you more concrete\ninformation hopefully in a few months when we have contacted\nand gotten information from each of those firms.\nSenator Cardin. As I encouraged from the last witness,\nplease give us your suggestions because you see there is a lot\nof frustration here and we really do want this program to be at\nits full--meet its full potential. And it is not doing that\ntoday.\nSo one of the areas is what you are talking about on\nparticipation from groups that we just do not have the numbers.\nThese numbers are pathetic. They are not even in the ballpark\nof where they need to be.\nSo we have taken looks at other areas of SBA programs that\nhave not reached, we think, full potential and we have taken\nsteps to correct that.\nSo your recommendations there, I think, can help us in\ntrying to meet those goals.\nMr. Palmer. And one thing I would add to that is, you know,\nit is a particular risk to step out and try to raise a private\nequity fund. You have no salary, you take a year to two years.\nAnd it is a particularly risk for women and minorities to take\nthat risk. It is a bigger leap.\nAnd so if you are trying to get more diverse fund managers\nin the SBIC program--which we certainly want to do, and I\nactually have some ideas in my testimony that I do think help\nmove the needle there--just look at the new funds. You heard\nfrom the first witness that we have so many new funds coming\nin. Total new pipeline is down 45 percent year over year. It is\nnot new funds coming in. They are being actively scared off.\nAnd if you cannot keep the funds that you have because they\nthink they are being mistreated and paralyzed, then how are you\nsupposed to get people to take that entrepreneurial risk to\nform a new fund that is a woman or a minority? It is really\nhard.\nSenator Cardin. It is just hard to understand why we have\nnot done better in creating new funds in minority and women\ncommunities. It is a logical step for the SBIC program to have\nachieved and it does require an attitude of SBA to do this.\nMr. Palmer. I have had 10 chairs of the board over my\nterms. Four have been women. So that is not 50 percent, but\nthat is good. We actually have a lot of women in leadership.\nActually, our northeast president next year is going to be a\nwoman from your state.\nWe have a lot--we have tried a lot of women and we are\nmaking progress there. It does take time. And I do think, part\nof the problem to get an SBIC fund is you have to come from\nprivate equity. So you are recycling from the same pool. We are\nfar more diverse than the rest of the private equity and\nventure industry but you are not going to really have a\nbreakout until you can broaden that pool out a little bit.\nAnd so actually, I have some proposals in here about how to\ndo that that I think work and could happen very quickly, that\nwe could see the next generation of minority and women fund\nmanagers in a way that is constructive and without subsidy.\nSo there is a lot we can do there but the program really is\nbeing--has major management problems right now. They do not\nhave staff in senior positions. You are missing more than one\nsenior staffer. You are missing the top career staffer, the\nDeputy Associate Administrator. You are missing the Director of\nLicensing and Program Development. They have three what are\ncalled area chiefs, that are in charge of managing the teams\nthat manage the funds day-to-day. There are three of those. Two\nof them are vacant.\nYou have a lot of--and some of these are positions that\nhave been open for over two years. And the Program Development\nOffice, whose job it is to recruit new funds and to help\nlicense funds in underserved states and underserved\ncommunities, consistent with Senator Rubio's bill, has gone\nfrom four FTEs to one. There is only a director left with zero\nemployees, and I do not think he has got a budget since last\nDecember.\nSo I am not sure the private sector is seeing the program\nbeing managed in the same way that the person running the\nprogram is seeing it. We see it from a very different lens that\nis very concerning. And I think the numbers and data back this\nup.\nThe private sector is not saying okay, we do not want to do\nSBICs or small business investment because there is an\nopportunity. But we are looking at that and going oh my gosh,\nare you kidding me? Am I going to walk into that buzz saw? Am I\ngoing to put my investors and my professional career on that\nline? And that is a problem.\nSenator Cardin. Look, I think Senator Kennedy's point about\nwe look at action rather than words, it was disappointing that\nwe did not have an acknowledgment as to numbers being\nunacceptable.\nI thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Rubio. Before turning to Senator Duckworth, just\none observation on your point. It is hard to attract new people\nwhen one of the requirements is that you cannot be new.\nMr. Palmer. Mm-hmm.\nChairman Rubio. In essence, what we are saying, you have to\nhave two fund managers with previous experience in order to be\nan applicant, you are basically saying the only people that can\napply are the people that have done it before. Well that, by\ndefinition, knocks out everybody who is new and wants to come\nin.\nMr. Palmer. That is right. You have to basically have been\nrecruited somewhere else in the private equity industry and\nthen you can spin out to form an SBIC. And that is why one of\nmy proposals is you can form bank-owned non-levered SBIC funds.\nThat is a big mouthful. But banks can do that and they have\ndone that. They exist across the country.\nAnd banks have something that SBICs do not have, which is\nscale. Some SBICs are as few as two people. Banks have really\ngood recruiting programs. They have gotten good at that in the\npast couple of years. And so if they form bank-owned non-\nlevered--one, they can help fill the equity gap, that is long-\nterm patient capital. Two, they can broaden the footprint. And\nthree, they can seed the next generation of private equity fund\nmanagers. That would be helpful.\nThat is not the only solution. This has got to be a multi-\nstep process. But there are a number of things that we can do.\nChairman Rubio. That may be a great idea, but it is not\ngoing to work unless you find a shorter term, a shorter word to\ndescribe it.\n[Laughter.]\nMr. Palmer. Yes, sorry, wonking out.\nChairman Rubio. We have got to come up with something\nfancy.\nSenator Duckworth.\nSenator Duckworth. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nActually, Mr. Palmer, I am glad you brought up banks\nbecause I think another component of the challenges that we are\nfacing with SBIC, especially for providing long-term loans to\ngrowing small businesses is that smaller banks find it very\ndifficult to invest in SBICs.\nMr. Palmer. Mm-hmm.\nSenator Duckworth. And when you talk about women and\nminority communities, you know, that is the realm of the\nsmaller banks, right?\nMr. Palmer. Mm-hmm.\nSenator Duckworth. They are the ones that tend to be, you\nknow, you have black-owned banks, women-owned banks. Those tend\nto be smaller. And I think that they are at a disadvantage to\nlarger banks who have greater access to this program.\nThis week Senator Young and I introduced the Investing in\nMain Street Act that would allow financial institutions to\ninvest a greater portion of their surplus and capital into\nSBICs.\nCould you describe how this legislation or this idea might\nhelp small businesses better access capital without\njeopardizing the safety and soundness of these financial\ninstitutions?\nMr. Palmer. Sure, absolutely. I think it is a great idea.\nThis is a provision that has already passed the House\nunanimously. It has broad bipartisan support and I appreciate\nyour taking it up.\nBasically, there is a timing issue, when banking law was\nwritten at a different time than the Small Business Investment\nAct. And so banks are allowed to invest more in small\nbusinesses via SBICs but the SBICs are not allowed to accept\nthe money from the banks to invest in small businesses from the\nbanks.\nIt is an accident of history. And this bill would fix that.\nAnd what that would do is get more capital flowing into SBICs.\nAnd one of the things that banks do, is banks have this big\nfootprint, to your point. And they have more interactions. And\na lot of times a small business will go to a bank and say I\nneed a loan. Well, that is not the type of stuff we do. You\nneed equity. You need unitranche. You need some complicated\nstructure, subordinated debt. You are not cash-flowing enough,\nwhatever it may be.\nBut they can turn around and hand that and say hey look,\nSBIC, here is a great opportunity. We know this client. They\nare in an underserved area. That is important to us from a\nbank, from a CRA perspective. Can you take a look and see if\nthis works. And often they do.\nThere are between 500 and 600 banks that are currently\ninvested in Small Business Investment Companies. They get very\ngood returns. But they also get community reinvestment\nassessment saying hey, is this serving these underserved\ncommunities? Because many times they are.\nSo yes, I think it would be very helpful. I think it does\nnot reduce any bank protections. It would still require the\napproval of the bank regulators to rise above that. But it\nwould increase small business access to capital and broaden the\nfootprint of small businesses that are exposed to it.\nSenator Duckworth. Thank you so much.\nProfessor Ozkazanc-Pan, you mentioned in your testimony\nwomen and minority-led VC firms have increased over time but a\nlot of work remains to be done. In 2016, SBA joined several\norganizations to launch the ONBOARD Initiative, designed to\ngive SBICs more options to hire diverse talent and assume board\nleadership positions.\nUnfortunately, it appears that SBA has done little to\npromote the initiative since its creation, I think missing a\nreal opportunity to help SBICs hire qualified, diverse\ncandidates for their management teams.\nCan you discuss why initiatives like this are so important\nto the investment community and what Congress and the SBA can\ndo to improve diversity on VC management firms?\nMs. Ozkazanc-Pan. Yes, absolutely. I think these kinds of\ninitiatives are profoundly important because they signal one,\ninterest and opportunity for women and minorities that they may\nnot otherwise see themselves in taking on these roles. But they\nalso communicate information and opportunities both in terms of\nsignaling to people that these are things available to them\nthat is not generally something that they see them for\nthemselves.\nI would say that if we continue with the program that is\nnot discontinued, that would be a step in the right direction.\nIn terms of VC firms, the reason we are seeing the\nemergence of women or minority or minority women-only focused\nfirms is because the VC, as a whole, is not moving fast enough.\nSo these are actually smaller firms that are trying to fill in\nthe gaps.\nAnd I believe that there could be potentially dedicated\nfunds that might also work in a similar fashion at the SBIC or\nthe SBA level.\nSenator Duckworth. Thank you.\nDid you want to add something, Mr. Muro?\nMr. Muro. My overarching point is simply that all of these\nare much more the technical questions. They really are about\noverall American well-being and competitiveness, you know. So\nto make sure that we are unveiling every great entrepreneurial\nopportunity, you know we are missing Einsteins and missing\nentrepreneurs.\nSo it is important that the systems works if we are going\nto push back against the challenge from China and elsewhere.\nSenator Duckworth. Thank you.\nMr. Palmer. And licensing more women fund managers and\nkeeping the fund managers you have that are women. There are a\nnumber of women that run funds right now that are pulling their\nhair out and deciding whether or not they want to do this. And\nso keeping them in, and getting more women fund managers, I\nthink is very helpful.\nThe Library of Congress studied this and they found\nbasically that like is more likely to invest in like. Women are\nmore likely to invest in other women and women-owned\nbusinesses. And the same thing is true for minority. When you\nhave minorities on your private equity team, you tend to invest\nmore in minority-run businesses.\nAnd so we just need to add more people into the program.\nSenator Duckworth. You spoke, Mr. Palmer, about these empty\npositions. The other thing that I am concerned about is the\nfact that there is no timeframe on application status updates\nand approvals or disapprovals as people are moving applications\nthrough the approval process.\nSenator Risch and I, along with several members of this\nCommittee, introduced the Small Business Investment Improvement\nAct of 2019 that would actually set the timeframes in which SBA\nmust give status updates to SBIC applicants and set deadlines.\nCan you speak a little bit about the importance of that\nportion of it, in terms of the need for timeframes and\ndeadlines?\nMr. Palmer. Sure. The way the SBICs work, they have to\nraise private capital. If you cannot pass a private filter, you\nhave no business going and getting a license. So you have to be\nresponsive to those private investors. You have to be able to\nmanage their expectations. I think I can get a license in X\nperiod of time. And this is a multi-step process with lots of\nstages.\nAnd every step of every licensing process, since the new\nmanagement of the Office of Investment has taken over, has\nbecome gummed up and unpredictable. It is regulatory roulette.\nAnd so we just do not know whether it is going to take--it\nused to take two weeks. Now it takes 13 months, in some cases,\nto get a green light letter for a repeat fund with a clean\nexaminations. That is nuts.\nMeanwhile, your investors, who are waiting on this money,\nthe pensions, the universities, the endowments who want to\ndeploy this capital to small business, they need to get a\nreturn. They cannot be sitting on millions of dollars doing\nnothing while you wait around for the SBA to get to license\nyou. Managing expectations is critical.\nSo having a process where it is clear, it is consistent, it\nis fair--if it is no, give me a quick no. But be fair about it.\nAnd dragging these things out where it is step after step after\nstep, it makes no sense.\nYou heard the first witness talk about examinations, he has\ndone such a good job. SBIC funds have zero control over the\nexaminations. The SBA does those. The SBA controls the time.\nThey control the results. It takes months to get them\nscheduled. It takes a month for them to do it. And it might\ntake 6 months or longer to get the results back.\nAnd during that time period, you cannot advance the\nlicensing period. You cannot reserve leverage. You cannot do a\nlot of your basic stuff you need to do unless your window\nhappens to come up at the same time their exam clock is going,\nof which you have no control.\nSo bragging about having a tightened credit standard for\nexaminations, where now 69 percent of the SBIC funds meet my\ncredit standard, they are compliant. Well, that means that the\nSBA is failing 30-plus percent of the SBICs being able to\noperate fully. And that does not work for licensing, it does\nnot work for any of it.\nAnd so having timelines and holding the accountable, I\nthink, is critical because this is the type of mundane stuff,\nadministrative stuff, that is paralyzing and is completely\nunnecessary.\nSenator Duckworth. Thank you.\nMr. Palmer. It is baffling. So it would be very helpful and\nwe welcome it. Thank you.\nSenator Duckworth. And it is a bipartisan bill.\nThank you. I yield back.\nChairman Rubio. Thank you.\nI want to thank you all for being here. We were delayed\nwith the votes and so forth, but just to kind of sum it up, if\nyou look at the need for innovation, innovation, by definition,\nis risky because it has never been done before. That is why it\nis innovative.\nAnd to do that takes money, right. And so people with money\nor entities with money are doing less of it than ever before.\nThe banks do not want to lend. They are kind of frozen in some\nway. They are just not in the business of doing that anymore.\nAnd private equity has moved further and further away from\nthat. They want to do less risky. They want a higher yield at a\nshorter or mid-term period of time and there is no taste for\nthat. So that is why programs like this exist in the small\nbusiness space.\nIn the big space, you are a multi-billionaire, you want to\ninvest in a rocket company, you can do that and they have done\nit. But if you are a small business person with a great idea,\nyou need access to capital. The banks will not give it to you.\nThe venture capital community does not like ideas like that. It\nis too risky. And so that is where this program comes into\nplay.\nSo it is concerning when we see the numbers flatline and\nbegin to decline at a time of great need. And I do not think we\nhave run out of ideas in this country, or people with them.\nAnd it is most concerning when you start to hear that we\nare going to be applying new criteria to the program and the\nbuzz words I am hearing are by the way, it is the same criteria\nof the funds and the banks that are not lending money now. So\nin essence, we are going to turn the SBIC program into a\nsimilar criteria to the ones that created the need for it in\nthe first place.\nAnd all of it happening, by the way, at a time which our\nNation desperately needs innovation. We need to come up with a\nresponse to Chinese industrial policy that threatens to\ndisplace us in industry after industry after industry around\nthe world. Very aggressive and we have not had an answer for\nit. And clearly, the current market conditions are not meeting\nthat demand.\nSo other than that, I think it is going well.\n[Laughter.]\nChairman Rubio. No, it was a very insightful hearing and\nthat is why I am so glad we are doing reauthorization because\nwe are not just having people come in and talk to us. We are\ngoing through the lines and the details at a granular level of\nthe entire agency and the programs that it has and trying to\nalign them to national priorities in a way that I hope can\nactually avoid some of the partisan fights that are going on.\nThis is stuff that should be unifying and I think can and\nhas a chance to be.\nSo we are grateful to all of you for your patience and the\ntime you have given us today.\nThe hearing record for this hearing is going to remain open\nfor two weeks. If there is any statements or questions for the\nrecord, they should be submitted by Wednesday, July 10th, at 5\np.m.\nAnd with that, the hearing is adjourned.\n[Whereupon, at 5:04 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]\nAPPENDIX MATERIAL SUBMITTED\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\n[all]",

Lisa\nMurkowski, Chairman of the Committee, presiding.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. LISA MURKOWSKI,\nU.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA\nThe Chairman. Good morning, everyone. The Committee will\ncome to order.\nWe are meeting to examine an issue that effectively we have\nbeen at a stalemate for quite some time--what we should do with\nthe used nuclear fuel that is accumulating at our nation's\nnuclear reactors.\nAs a starting point, I think we should recognize that\nnuclear energy is an important part of our country's electric\ngeneration mix. I believe it is a vital part of our mix. The\nlarge reactors that dot the landscape provide reliable,\nemissions-free power to communities across our country. Our\nnation's nuclear industry is critically important but it also\nfaces a number of challenges, and one that has impacted it\nsince the first reactors began operation is nuclear waste\ndisposition.\nBeginning with the passage of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act\nin 1982, Congress has attempted several times to address the\nback end of the fuel cycle. In an effort to resolve an earlier\nstalemate, the Federal Government was supposed to begin taking\ntitle to used fuel and moving it to a repository at Yucca\nMountain in Nevada, beginning in 1998. The Federal Government's\nfailure to deliver on this promise is now costing taxpayers up\nto $2 million per day.\nThis hearing is an opportunity for us to consider our next\nsteps on nuclear waste. Do we continue to delay in the face of\nstalemate over Yucca, or do we try to find another path forward\nfor used fuel storage, especially for communities that are\nmaintaining sites with only used fuel casks left on hand, with\nthe rest of the plant decommissioned?\nIn 2010, then Secretary of Energy, Steven Chu, convened the\nBlue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to conduct a\ncomprehensive review of policies for managing the back end of\nthe fuel cycle. The Commission's report included a number of\nrecommendations and led to the introduction of the Nuclear\nWaste Administration Act. Over the years, this legislation has\nbeen led by a number of members, including Senators Wyden and\nAlexander, both on this Committee. I have been a sponsor of the\nlegislation all along with Senators Alexander and Feinstein, my\npartners on the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee,\nfor multiple Congresses, now.\nWe have been at this for a while, and I think it is\nprobably fair to say we would like to put something behind us\nat some point in time here sooner rather than later. Our\nlegislation aims to move the process forward so that we can\nfinally move used fuel to a permanent repository. Our bill\ncreates a Nuclear Waste Administration to oversee consent-based\nsiting for interim storage and an additional repository that\ncould be located in states and communities that want it. Our\nbill also prioritizes the removal of orphaned used fuel at\ndecommissioned reactor sites for temporary storage at\nconsolidated sites.\nOur bill is S. 1234. I wish it was as easy as one, two,\nthree, four. We know it requires some updates and that there\nare a number of ideas to improve specific sections, so I\nwelcome those. I look forward to the testimony from our\ndistinguished panel this morning, but I would also welcome\nthoughts and comments from others.\nUltimately, I hope we can all agree that it is long, long,\npast time to figure this out and the sooner we find a path\nforward, the better. It has been six years now since I and\nothers cosponsored this legislation. We are in the same place.\nWe are effectively in the same place when it comes to the back\nend of the fuel cycle as when we introduced that legislation\nsix years ago. But in that time we have seen tremendous\nprogress in the area of nuclear with our advanced nuclear\nreactors. The United States has the ability to lead the world\non some of these technologies, but without a solution on\nnuclear waste, I believe that we are less likely to realize our\nfull potential there. We are here today to start, or perhaps we\nneed to say restart, the conversation.\nI know that Chairman Barrasso has a bill on nuclear waste\nin his EPW Committee. He is keen to move forward on it. I am\nglad to see that we have some renewed interest across Congress\nto address the challenge.\nIt is a good thing that we have multiple options on the\ntable. I think this is a positive development, and I sincerely\nhope that we can move forward on nuclear waste after decades of\ninaction.\nWith that, I turn to my Ranking Member and friend, Senator\nManchin.\nSTATEMENT OF HON. JOE MANCHIN III,\nU.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA\nSenator Manchin. Chair Murkowski, thank you for having a\nhearing on the Nuclear Waste Administration Act, and I want to\nthank all of our witnesses for being here today who will\nprovide us with ideas of how to move forward and break our\nnuclear repository impasse.\nNuclear energy will continue to be an important part of our\nnation's energy mix. It is reliable, especially in adverse\nweather. The fact is, it is the nation's largest zero emission\npower source which means that it is a powerful tool in our\nfight to mitigate climate change and move toward a zero\nemissions economy.\nWe will continue to rely on nuclear, thus we must work on a\nsolution to dispose of nuclear waste. I believe this bill\nprovides a solid foundation to work from which originated with\nthe bipartisan Blue Ribbon Commission on America's nuclear\nfuture.\nBut I think there is an agreement among us that changes\nmust be made to the current text before moving forward.\nProviding an equitable policy path forward for site selection\nis something that I support as the inequity in the site\nselection is a large part of the current impasse.\nSince the National Academy of Sciences 1957 report\nrecommending deep geologic disposal for highly radioactive\nwaste, it is clear what we need to do with the nuclear waste.\nThe prudent and responsible thing to do is to bury this waste\ndeep in the earth to protect the environment and public for\ngenerations to come. Unfortunately, the path to achieve this is\nnot entirely clear.\nI look forward to hearing from our panel today and from my\ncolleagues, many of whom represent constituencies that deal\nwith nuclear waste on a day-to-day basis.\nIn particular, I want to thank Chairman Murkowski and\nSenator Cortez Masto for their ongoing leadership on this\nissue. If we have learned anything in the past 30 years, it is\nthat social and political concerns need to be taken into\naccount to site and construct a repository. That is not to say\nthat technical considerations are not important, but I trust\nthe highly skilled individuals at the national labs and their\npartners to solve issues that we will face in constructing\nstorage solutions at whatever site or sites that are selected.\nWhat Congress should focus on are the mechanisms that can\ndrive buy-in from communities. Other countries in the world\nhave success by creating an organization that is separate from\nan agency or governing body but still regulated by the\ngovernment to work with communities to build a repository in\ntheir respective backyards.\nIn 1987 Congress decided to not go with the original\nNuclear Waste Policy Act language that directed the Department\nof Energy to characterize several sites and then make a\nrecommendation. Instead, due to the price tag associated with\nthe characterization of several sites, Congress instead\nlegislated this site choice. This action politicized the site\nselection process while simultaneously discrediting the Federal\nGovernment.\nIt is my hope that following the markup of this bill, it\nwill be equitable in how it considers all sites so when a site\nor sites are selected, we know it was a fair process and can\nmove forward accordingly.\nLet us not forget that there is urgency to this issue.\nSpent fuel pools such as reactors are at capacity and in need\nto mitigate carbon emission and ensures that reactors will\ncontinue to operate in this country for decades to come. On top\nof that, failing to act means that the Federal Government is\nracking up more liability to be paid to the utilities to store\nthis waste in their own private storage facilities adjacent to\nthe reactors.\nSo the taxpayer is on the hook here to the tune of about $2\nmillion a day with an estimated overall liability of $34.1\nbillion. Like it or not, this means that we already have a de\nfacto interim storage program in this country that is\ninefficient and lacks cost-effectiveness.\nWhile we don't have any nuclear waste in West Virginia, nor\ndo we have nuclear reactors, I am invested in working with my\ncolleagues on this issue because preserving and growing nuclear\npower is key to addressing the climate crisis.\nI want to share with you. The Chairman and I had an\nopportunity to spend some time with Bill Gates and he went\nthrough boom, boom, boom, country, by country, by country that\nhas nuclear power, all going to zero in a time and era when we\nwant to have zero emissions. Something has to be done, and we\nneed to act urgently.\nOnce again, I would like to thank Chairman Murkowski for\nholding this hearing at the most appropriate time and I think\nmuch needed, not just for the United States of America, but for\nthe world.\nThank you.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator Manchin.\nLet's turn now to our panel. We have a very distinguished\npanel, as I mentioned.\nWe are joined this morning by Maria Korsnick, who is the\nPresident and CEO of Nuclear Energy Institute, NEI. You have\nbeen before the Committee many times. We welcome you back.\nMr. Wayne Norton is the Chair for the Decommissioning Plant\nCoalition Steering Committee, also President and CEO of the\nYankee Atomic Electric Company. We appreciate you being here\nthis morning.\nSteven Nesbit is the Chair of the American Nuclear Society,\nNuclear Waste Policy Task Force. We thank you for your\nleadership with that important task force.\nGeoffrey Fettus is the Senior Attorney at the Nuclear,\nClimate and Clean Energy Program for the Natural Resource\nDefense Council, NRDC. We welcome you to the Committee.\nAnd Dr. John Wagner is with us from one of our national\nlabs. He is the Associate Laboratory Director for Nuclear\nScience and Technology Directorate at the Idaho National Lab\n(INL). We appreciate your leadership in these spaces as well.\nWe will begin with you, Ms. Korsnick. If you can provide\nyour comments to the Committee, we ask that you try to keep\nyour comments to about five minutes. Your full statements will\nbe included as part of the record. When the full panel has\nconcluded, we will have an opportunity for questions. Thank\nyou.\nSTATEMENT OF MARIA KORSNICK, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE\nOFFICER, NUCLEAR ENERGY INSTITUTE\nMs. Korsnick. Great, thank you very much.\nI'm Maria Korsnick, President and CEO of the Nuclear Energy\nInstitute.\nChairman Murkowski and Ranking Member Manchin, I greatly\nappreciate the opportunity to provide testimony of the Nuclear\nWaste Administration Act of 2019. NEI sincerely appreciates the\nCommittee's deliberate effort to develop an effective federal\nused fuel management program.\nSince this bill was first introduced in 2013, several\nthings have changed. Because of a court order, the Department\nof Energy has reduced the nuclear waste fee fund to zero. The\nNuclear Regulatory Commission technical staff has also\ncompleted reviews of the Yucca Mountain licensing application\nconcluding that Yucca Mountain complies with all regulation.\nFinally, private initiatives are now underway to develop\nconsolidated storage facilities into states.\nNuclear energy is the largest and most efficient source of\ncarbon-free electricity in the United States. Currently, 97\ncommercial nuclear power plants in 29 states provide nearly 20\npercent of America's electricity and more than half of the\nemissions-free electricity. These reactors are carbon-free\nworkhorses essential to addressing climate change in any\nrealistic manner. That said, the advanced reactors of tomorrow\nin the U.S. operating fleet at large are continually subjected\nto reputational damage because Congress, for two decades now,\nhas played politics with the issue of used fuel.\nIt's vitally important that the U.S. remain a global leader\nin the commercial nuclear arena, and yet we are the only major\nnuclear nation without a used fuel management program. The U.S.\nnuclear industry has upheld its end of the bargain at sites in\n35 states around the country, commercial used fuel is safely\nstored and managed awaiting pick up by the Federal Government\nwhich was scheduled for 1998.\nIn addition, the nuclear waste fund, which was set up to\nfinance the development of a national repository, currently has\nover $41 billion in its coffers which has been contributed by\nelectricity consumers and nuclear generation companies. Each\nyear over $1.5 billion more in interest accumulates in the\nfund. And finally, each day we don't have a solution, does cost\ntaxpayers $2.2 million in damages, the single largest liability\npaid out of the judgment fund year after year. It's really time\nto solve this, and I'm excited to talk about how that can be\nachieved.\nWe need a durable used fuel program. We must allow the\nscience, not the politics, to guide us forward. But let me be\nclear, Congressional action is necessary and three important\npoints must be addressed.\nFirst, we need to answer on the Yucca Mountain license\napplication. DOE submitted the application to the NRC more than\na decade ago, and Congress directed the NRC to issue a decision\nin 2012. This deadline, like too many, was missed because DOE,\nwithout basis, shut down the Yucca Mountain project. For the\nsake of the communities holding stranded used fuel wishing to\nredevelop their sites, we must move forward and allow Nevada's\nconcerns with Yucca Mountain to be heard by NRC's independent\nadministrative judges. This will allow a licensing decision to\nbe determined based on its scientific merits rather than\npolitics.\nSecond, as a licensing process of Yucca Mountain moves\nforward, interim storage can play an important role in helping\nmove spent fuel away from reactor sites. Moving interim storage\nin parallel with the Yucca Mountain project helps to alleviate\nstate and local concerns that interim storage will become a de\nfacto disposal facility. This point was highlighted recently in\na letter by New Mexico Governor, Lujan Grisham. That said, I'm\npleased interim storage is addressed in S. 1234, the Nuclear\nWaste Administration Act. I strongly believe interim storage\ncan be successful if moved in parallel with the Yucca Mountain\nlicensing.\nAnd finally, the nuclear industry and electricity consumers\naround the country have paid their fair share to address the\nback end of the fuel cycle. But S. 1234 was originally drafted\nprior to the court mandated prohibition on the fee, and I want\nto strongly convey the importance of not prematurely re-\nimposing the nuclear waste fee, especially given the\nsubstantial balance and large investment interest which accrues\nannually.\nThe industry believes that the fee should not be reinstated\nuntil (1) the annual expense for the program's ongoing projects\nexceed the annual investment and come on the fund, and (2) the\nprojected life cycle cost demonstrates that the fee must be\nreinstated to achieve full cost recovery over the life of the\nprogram.\nThe fact that we are here today considering this\nlegislation is a positive step in the right direction, and I\nsincerely appreciate the Committee's motivation to find a\ndurable solution.\nWe look forward to continuing to work with each and every\none of you to reach bipartisan consensus on the best approach\nfor long-term management of the nation's used fuel.\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions.\n[The prepared statement of Ms. Korsnick follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Thank you.\nMr. Norton, welcome.\nSTATEMENT OF WAYNE NORTON, CHAIR, DECOMMISSIONING PLANT\nCOALITION STEERING COMMITTEE, AND PRESIDENT & CEO, YANKEE\nATOMIC ELECTRIC COMPANY\nMr. Norton. Good morning, Chairman Murkowski, Ranking\nMember Manchin and members of the Committee. My name is Wayne\nNorton. I'm the President and CEO of Yankee Atomic Electric\nCompany with responsibility for Maine Yankee, Connecticut\nYankee and Yankee Rowe nuclear facilities.\nThe three nuclear plants at my sites are fully\ndecommissioned but for the storage facilities for the spent\nfuel and graded and Class C waste produced during our operating\nlife.\nEach company is undergoing litigation with the Department\nof Energy for monetary damages resulting from its partial\nbreach of contract. To date, the courts have awarded my\ncompanies damages of approximately $575 million, claims that\nnow encompass virtually all cost for the management of our\ncompanies and the fuel storage facilities.\nIn addition, I serve as the Chair of the Decommissioning\nPlant Coalition (DPC) Steering Committee. And as such, I want\nto express our appreciation for this invitation to appear\nbefore you today on behalf of the Coalition and would ask that\nour full statement, excuse me, be read into the part of the\nrecord.\nWe are here today, in part, because the failure of the\nFederal Government to make good on its commitment is creating a\nspent fuel management burden across the increased number of\nstates and localities. This delay in performance by the\ngovernment has created a situation whereby communities across\nthe nation are becoming the unanticipated home for interim\nstorage of spent nuclear fuel.\nIn New England alone there are five sites in four states\nthat are providing indefinite storage of this material, even\nthough the electric ratepayers in that region have met their\nobligations and paid upward of $3 billion into the nuclear\nwaste fund.\nMembers of the Decommissioning Plant Coalition have adopted\na formal position statement that emphasizes our support for an\nintegrated nuclear waste program that provides for the timely\nand safe solution to removing this material from our sites.\nMany of these positions are captured in the recommendations of\nthe Blue Ribbon Commission and in Senate 1234, the Nuclear\nWaste Administration Act.\nI'd like to focus on two issues relative to the Blue Ribbon\nCommission recommendations and Senate 1234. One, consolidate\ninterim storage, and two, funding reform.\nAs suggested by the Blue Ribbon Commission, Senate 1234\ncalls for a consolidated interim storage program as part of an\nactive repository siting and licensing effort. Given that\nCongress has not funded the current repository program for\nalmost a decade, given the current federal and state tension\nrelative to the repository program and given the future funding\nconstraints and mounting taxpayer liabilities, we at the DPC\nalso believe the most effective and timely path to remedy the\ngovernment's default lies with such a program.\nWe appreciate the fact that Senate 1234 does not prohibit\nthe commencement of fuel movement to CIS facility prior to\nfinal action on the repository licensing application. Based on\nthe most credible estimates for this licensing action, it seems\nclear that a consolidated interim storage facility license will\nlikely be granted first and the explicit linkage between the\ntwo could unduly delay the anticipated title transfer and fuel\nacceptance, a key to reducing ongoing taxpayer liability.\nTitle IV of Senate 1234 is a clear effort to correct our\nmajor policy concern relative to the sufficient and reliable\nfunding of the program. The establishment of a new working\ncapital fund is clear movement in a direction that the DPC\nsupports. However, it does not fully resolve the continued risk\nof annual appropriations and, perhaps more importantly, it\nleaves unresolved, the matter of $40 billion already funded\ninto the nuclear waste fund.\nIn conclusion, along with many of our other national\norganizations which you'll hear from today, the DPC has\nrepeatedly called for the need for urgent action by Congress to\nestablish an integrated national nuclear waste program.\nContinued inaction is now costing American taxpayers, as\nyou've heard today, approximately $2.2 million a day and the\nratepayers of New England and this nation deserve to see the\ntens of billions of dollars, already collected, used for its\nintended purpose.\nMadam Chairman, Ranking Member Manchin and members of the\nCommittee, the DPC deeply appreciates your interest in this\nissue. We are encouraged by your legislative initiative and the\nattention you have brought through the conduct of this hearing.\nThank you for the opportunity to testify today. I'd be glad\nto answer any questions.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Norton follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Norton.\nMr. Nesbit, welcome.\nSTATEMENT OF STEVEN P. NESBIT, CHAIR, NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY TASK\nFORCE, ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN NUCLEAR SOCIETY\nMr. Nesbit. Thank you, Chairwoman Murkowski, Ranking Member\nManchin and members of the Committee. I appreciate the\nopportunity to testify on behalf of the American Nuclear\nSociety (ANS). ANS represents 10,000 men and women who work\nevery day to provide clean energy, detect and cure cancer\nthrough nuclear medicine, develop systems to power deep space\nexploration and enable the many other beneficial applications\nof the atom.\nWe applaud the introduction of the Nuclear Waste\nAdministration Act of 2019 as a serious effort to break the\npolitical log jam that prevents the effective management of\nnuclear waste in the U.S. To the detriment of the American\npeople, the Federal Government is approaching a decade of\ninexcusable inaction in this critical area, an impending\nanniversary that should spur Congress and the Administration to\naction.\nTo be clear, used nuclear fuel is being stored safely today\nand poses no immediate danger to the public; however, the lack\nof progress on a geologic repository has clearly endangered\nnuclear power's potential to address our long-term energy and\nenvironmental objectives.\nIn particular, advanced reactor developers, men and women,\nwho are earnestly striving to meet global demand for emissions-\nfree, reliable energy are most impacted by the question, what\nabout the waste?\nI will turn now to discuss several key provisions of S.\n1234 along with other governmental actions that we believe can\nbegin addressing that very fundamental question.\nWe endorse the initiation of a search for a geologic\nrepository site other than Yucca Mountain as required by\nSection 306 of the proposed legislation. Make no mistake about\nit, ANS strongly supports the timely completion of Yucca\nMountain licensing; nevertheless, if Yucca Mountain doesn't\nbecome operational, our waste will have to go somewhere.\nConsolidated interim storage by itself is not the solution, and\nthe country deserves a better understanding of what options are\nrealistically available.\nTo enable repository siting, the government needs to update\nseveral regulations to reflect scientific advances and lessons\nlearned over the past decades. In particular, the nation's\ngeneric environmental standard for geologic repositories, 40\nCFR Part 191, lacks transparency, is out of date and is\ninconsistent with international guidelines.\nWe endorse a consolidated interim storage program with\npriority for fuel at shut down plants as authorized by Section\n305. However, Congress should understand that success in this\narea is unlikely without a credible repository program.\nANS supports a new independent entity to manage high level\nwaste but has some concerns with a new government agency\nproposed entitled to the NWAA. We suggest continued\nconsideration be given to the public corporation model.\nHigh level waste funding reform is essential. Title IV of\nthe bill takes a step in the right direction by improving\naccess to future contributions to the Nuclear Waste Fund. The\nCommittee should also consider incorporating practical\nprovisions to allow an empowered management entity to use the\nexisting balance of the fund.\nThe approach to consent-based siting of nuclear waste\nmanagement facilities described in Sections 305 and 306 appear\nreasonable; however, it is an open question if a process with\nall parties having an absolute veto can succeed in our system\nof government. Additional information on these points and\nothers is provided in my written testimony.\nIn closing, ANS suggests three principles for future\naction. First, make real progress by focusing on achievable\ntasks. Create a viable management organization with the\nnecessary resources that can work without undue political\ninterference. Empower that organization to complete Yucca\nMountain licensing, investigate a second repository site and\nmove forward on consolidated interim storage. Initiate the\ndevelopment of up-to-date repository regulations for sites\nother than Yucca Mountain. Engage with Nevada and other\npotential host states and communities.\nSecond, seek to combine the concepts of ``consent'' and\n``benefit.'' In addition to money from the Nuclear Waste Fund,\nthe Federal Government has many means of providing\ninfrastructure improvements, federal land, educational\nopportunities and other means of support to states and\ncommunities interested in exploring a partnership on the\nmanagement of nuclear material. Make those potential benefits\nabundantly clear from the beginning.\nThird, empower our scientists and engineers. Congress must\naddress the legal and administrative issues associated with\nnuclear waste. But we will not succeed if we allow politics to\noverwhelm good science. Act based on real risk, not perceived\nrisk. We must give our best and brightest nuclear professionals\nthe opportunity to take on this challenge with some degree of\nindependence, funding and flexibility.\nI thank you again for the opportunity to testify and stand\nready to answer your questions. I yield back the remainder of\nmy time.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Nesbit follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Nesbit. We appreciate that.\nMr. Fettus, welcome.\nSTATEMENT OF GEOFFREY H. FETTUS, SENIOR ATTORNEY, NATURAL\nRESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL, INC.\nMr. Fettus. Thank you, Chairman Murkowski and Ranking\nMember Manchin and members of the Committee. Thank you for the\nopportunity to present NRDC's views.\nChairman Murkowski started the hearing perfectly when she\nsaid we're in the same place. We trust this can be a new\nbeginning with more than 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel in\nmore than half of our states and reactors moving to\ndecommissioning, we need to reset the process. S. 1234 however,\nwill not solve the current stalemate and won't lead toward\nworkable solutions; therefore, we oppose it in its current\nform.\nFor more than 50 years Congress has offered and even passed\nbills that would restart the Yucca licensing process or kick\nopen a door in New Mexico or Utah for an interim storage site.\nIn doing those things, S. 1234 severs any meaningful link\nbetween storage and disposal and excludes Nevada from the\nconsent process it sets up. This won't work. And such efforts\nhave failed in Tennessee, in Kansas, Nevada, Utah and\neverywhere else. Another such attempt restarts litigation and\ncontroversy and the likely result is the continued stalemate\nwe've been in.\nSeven years ago, a bipartisan Blue Ribbon Commission keenly\ndescribed why past attempts failed. That Commission wisely\nasserted we can't keep doing the same thing. Congress must\ncreate a process that allows any potential host state to\ndemonstrate consent or, for that matter, non-consent.\nSo rather than spend more of your valuable time on the\nspecifics of why this won't work, they're all in the written\ntestimony, I put before you a durable, meaningful, reset of how\nwe can manage and dispose of nuclear waste and how we can\nreally achieve consent. The solution could be summed up simply.\nGive EPA and the states power under well-established\nenvironmental statutes so that they can set the terms for how\nmuch and on what conditions they could host a disposal site.\nRadioactive waste is stranded at sites across the country\nand will remain so because the Atomic Energy Act treats\nradioactive waste as a privilege pollutant. The Act preempts\nthe regulatory authority of EPA and the states, exempting\nradioactivity from hazardous waste law and sizable portions of\nthe Clean Water Act. It ignores the vital role states play in\naddressing other environmental pollutants.\nSenator Manchin talked of a mechanism that can drive buy-\nin. Our government is at its strongest when each player's role\nis respected. As an example, the years of wrangling over what\nstandards should be set for cleanup at our massively\ncontaminated nuclear weapon sites, such as those in Washington\nor South Carolina, is made exponentially worse by DOE's self-\nregulatory status which the Atomic Energy Act ordains with\nthese exemptions.\nThe same is true with commercial spent fuel where any state\nthat is targeted to receive nuclear waste looks to be on the\nhook for the entire burden of the nation's spent fuel. State\nconsent and public acceptance of potential repository sites\nwill never be willingly granted unless and until power on how,\nwhen and where waste is disposed of is shared rather than\ndecided simply by federal fiat.\nThere's only one way consent can happen consistent with our\ncooperative federalism. Specifically, Congress can finally\nremove the Atomic Energy Act's anachronistic exemptions from\nour bedrock environmental laws. Our hazardous waste and clean\nwater laws must include full authority over radioactivity and\nnuclear waste facilities so that EPA and, most importantly, the\nstates can assert direct regulatory authority.\nRemoving these exemptions will not magically solve this\npuzzle and create a final repository, but I think it can work\nfaster than what we have now because it will open a path\nforward that respects each state rather than offering up the\nlatest one for sacrifice. The Texas and New Mexico events of\nthe last several weeks demonstrate this.\nWhy will NRDC's plan work and why does this provide a\nbetter chance than S. 1234? Because a state can say no. It can\nalso say, yes. And it can set the terms for how it will receive\nthe waste and, importantly, not be on the hook for the entire\nburden because a state can protect its citizens and\nenvironment, limit what comes into the state. Such a new regime\nwould allow for the thorough technical review on the ability of\nany site to meet strict, protective standards unlike the years\nof fighting that have been the hallmark of this process. And\njust as important, that fundamental sharing of power can result\nin public acceptance of solutions.\nWe've seen these bills before. Each has been a mirror of\nthe last. It's time to try something that has a proven track\nrecord of addressing other controversial topics.\nIf you want to garner the consent the Blue Ribbon\nCommission deemed necessary, you have to give EPA and the\nstates regulatory authority under environmental law. It's time\nto regulate nuclear waste the same way as every other pollutant\nwith EPA and delegated states taking the lead under our\nfoundational environmental statutes.\nThank you again for having me here today, and I look\nforward to answering your questions.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Fettus follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Fettus.\nLet's go to views from the Idaho National Lab. Dr. Wagner.\nSTATEMENT OF DR. JOHN WAGNER, ASSOCIATE LABORATORY DIRECTOR,\nNUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DIRECTORATE, IDAHO NATIONAL\nLABORATORY\nDr. Wagner. Chairman Murkowski, Ranking Member Manchin and\nmembers of the Committee, it's an honor to be here with you\ntoday.\nI want to particularly thank Senators Murkowski, Feinstein\nand Alexander for sponsoring the significant legislation and\ntheir persistent efforts to make progress on this critically\nimportant issue for the nation, in general, and for nuclear\nenergy, in particular.\nCurrently, I oversee INL's Nuclear Energy Research,\nDevelopment and Demonstration efforts, including R&D related to\nspent nuclear fuel storage, transportation and disposal.\nThroughout my career, I've been intimately involved in the\ntechnical issues around spent nuclear fuel storage,\ntransportation and disposal working in the private sector as\nwell as for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, supporting the\nNuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department of Energy on\nthese issues, including leading a DOE program to implement the\nBlue Ribbon Commission on America's nuclear future recommended\nnear-term actions which involved laying the groundwork for\nimplementing interim storage as well as the associated\ntransportation to support that.\nAs the nation's nuclear energy research development and\ndemonstration laboratory, INL is the leader in the effort to\nmaintain and expand the lives of America's nuclear reactor\nfleet. These safe, efficient and high performing systems\nproduce nearly 20 percent of the nation's electricity and more\nthan half of our carbon-free electricity. That's more than\nsolar, wind, hydro and geothermal combined.\nAt INL we also work with industry on innovative advanced\nreactor designs. This includes megawatt scale microreactors,\nsmall modular reactors and a variety of advanced designs that\noffer the potential for improved performance, greater inherent\nsafety features and approved applicability for certain market\napplications as well as reduced construction, licensing and\noperating costs.\nAs this Committee heard on April 30th, during a discussion\non the Nuclear Energy Leadership Act, or NELA, a strong and\nvibrant commercial nuclear industry is vital to the United\nStates environment, power grid reliability and security,\neconomy and national security. Accordingly, we must address\nsome major impediments to developing and deploying advanced\nnuclear reactors.\nCongress, to its credit, has begun this process by passing\ntwo important pieces of legislation, the Nuclear Energy\nInnovation Capabilities Act, or NEICA, and the Nuclear Energy\nInnovation and Modernization Act, NEIMA, and reintroduced a\nthird which I referred to earlier, NELA. Now it's time to\naddress the waste issue, an impediment to development of the\nnew advanced reactors as well as continued operation of the\nexisting plant in some cases.\nFirst and foremost, I want to be clear from a technical\nstandpoint. Spent nuclear fuel storage and transportation is\nsafe as evidenced by more than 50 years of safe and secure\noperations by the public and private sectors. We do not have a\nspent nuclear fuel safety crisis in this country.\nWe do, however, have issues caused by the lack of a\nsustained, coherent approach for nuclear waste and not having a\nfinal disposition solution. This has resulted in longer than\nanticipated storage, as you all know. The national laboratories\nand industry, in coordination with the Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission, are proactively identifying and addressing the\nassociated potential technical issues with this situation.\nMore worrisome though than the relatively minor technical\nrisk of extended storage are the socio-economic and community\nimpacts resulting from onsite storage at permanently shut down\nreactor sites. The cost, which has been referred to multiple\ntimes this morning already, of approximately $2.2 million per\nday for taxpayers which will only increase until the government\nbegins to take possession of the spent fuel and will also\nincrease as additional existing plants are shut down.\nAnd then finally, the negative impact on public acceptance\nof new nuclear energy which was also referred to earlier, given\nthe lack of progress to address the waste. In our mission at\nthe Idaho National Laboratory related to research, development\nand demonstration and ultimate deployment of advanced reactor\nsystems, we frequently encounter this issue of how in the world\ncan we talk about new nuclear reactors when we have not\naddressed the waste issue? Because of all this, an interim\nstorage facility can be viewed as an economic investment for\nthe nation that addresses these issues and provides a range of\nother benefits that have been identified in numerous studies,\nincluding the BRC report that I referred to earlier.\nFinally, I'd like to note that I'm encouraged that Senate\nbill 1234 identifies defense-related spent fuel under a\ncompliance agreement, as a priority at the discretion of the\nnew administrator. The Department of Energy at the INL site is\nresponsible for managing and storing a range of spent fuel,\nincluding defense-related spent fuel. This bill would enable a\nmeaningful storage alternative for those materials.\nI appreciate the opportunity to testify. I want to thank\nyou again for your attention to this important issue for our\nnation, and I look forward to answering any of your questions.\n[The prepared statement of Dr. Wagner follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Dr. Wagner, and thank each of you\nfor being here this morning and for what you are providing the\nCommittee.\nIt is clear that the reviews, the studies, everybody agrees\nwe have to deal with the permanent in order to get to interim.\nThe discussion about interim sites becoming de facto permanent,\nthat is kind of where we are, unfortunately, around the country\nwhich I don't think any of us believe is truly acceptable for\nthe long-term.\nWe are not the only nation that has nuclear waste to deal\nwith. It is not like this is a case of first impression here.\nThere has been reference, plenty of reference, to other nations\nand how they handle their nuclear waste. Finland and Sweden are\nheld out as good examples of areas where they have deep\ngeologic repository siting. They have a consent-based approach.\nMr. Nesbit, you mentioned in your recommendations to us\nthat there has to be consent and benefit tied together. What\nhave they been able to do successfully that we should be\nlooking to? Are their geologic formations different than ours\nand that is what gives them the leg up? Is it more that they do\nwith the consent-based? I am trying to figure out by looking to\nothers who have been more successful than we have, what we\nmight learn. And I throw that out to anybody here on the panel.\nMr. Nesbit, and then we will go to Mr. Fettus.\nMr. Nesbit. Well, first of all, it's not the geology. The\nUnited States is blessed with a vast number of different\ngeologic media which are all suitable for repository\ndevelopment. They have advantages, they have disadvantages, but\nin a way it may be a problem that we have so many options\navailable to us. In other countries they're smaller and they\nreally just have to concentrate on one option.\nThe other thing I'd like to point out is that in those\ncountries that have been successful so far in what you would\ncall a consent-based siting process, they do not have anything\nthat corresponds to the state government in the United States\nand that's just the nature of their governmental structure,\nSweden and Finland. It has been a challenge in the United\nStates siting waste facilities and typically the hang-up is at\nthe state level.\nThe Chairman. Your thoughts, Mr. Fettus?\nMr. Fettus. I would actually agree with a lot of what Mr.\nNesbit just said, so I hope the Committee notes that. That one,\nwe call for in my written testimony, a return to the USGS had\nstarted some superb work at looking at the vast, over 36 states\nand dozens and dozens of places around the country that have\npotential.\nBut I would urge the Committee to reflect on the fact that,\nnumber one, there is no country that has fully sited a deep\ngeologic repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level\nwaste, yet. Sweden and Finland are farther down the road, but\nfor, in great measure, precisely the reason that Mr. Nesbit\njust pointed out which is they don't have the tripartite system\nwe do of both a community, a state and the Federal Government.\nThey don't have that interlocutory layer.\nAnd if you want to solve it consistent with our\nenvironmental laws, we've always taken accord of the states.\nAnd so, that's the basis of my testimony.\nThe Chairman. I appreciate that.\nLet me ask you, Mr. Norton, what does it cost to maintain a\ndecommissioned plant that still has used fuel on its site on\naverage, just give me a range?\nMr. Norton. Thank you for the question, Senator.\nAt my sites, as you'll see in my written testimony, it's\napproximately $30 million a year combined between the three\nsites to maintain those facilities and the corporate structure\nassociated with it.\nThe Chairman. What is happening on the site right now? I\nmean, in terms of you have workers there that are just ensuring\nthat there is a level of safety. What is costing you $30\nmillion?\nMr. Norton. Well, the interesting part about our companies,\nSenator, is that, Madam Chairman, is that we're also managing\nour corporations and not just the storage of the spent fuel at\nour sites. I think if you just looked at spent fuel storage,\nthe cost would be closer to $6.5 million per site. But as the\ncourts have found in our cases, our corporation single asset\nutilities would have gone out of business had the government\nperformed.\nThe Chairman. Right.\nMr. Norton. So not only is our damages including the cost\nof safely and securely storing the fuel, but also to manage our\ncorporations and remain in existence until such time as the\ngovernment performs.\nThe Chairman. But about $6.5 million per site, on average.\nMr. Norton. Yeah, on average.\nThe Chairman. In order to transport spent fuel canisters,\ndo you anticipate that upgrades will be required to these sites\nas you look forward?\nMr. Norton. Well, I would expect across the nation, Madam\nChairman, that there would be upgrades required. And depending\non the facility, would depend on the significance of that.\nFor instance, the Department of Energy has been doing\nstudies, pre-planning studies, for de-inventorying these sites\nand looked at the transportation challenges, independent to\nmany of these sites, including the shutdown ones and including\nmy three. And in each of these sites is unique in those\nchallenges. And so, for instance, at Maine Yankee, there would\nbe minimal upgrades required at the site itself. The inventory\nreports have looked more broadly at the entire transportation\nroute. And I realize that the Department of Energy and others\nhave focused on that issue and should continue to focus on that\nissue. But, you know, the entire transportation pathway needs\nto be analyzed.\nSo, I think it's site specific, but I am certain that\nalmost every site in the nation would have to have some level\nof upgrade to start removing this material from their sites.\nThe Chairman. I think it is important for us to understand\nthat.\nLet me turn to Senator Manchin.\nSenator Manchin. Thank you, Madam Chairman.\nI think finding a solution to our nation's nuclear waste\nimpasse is critically important, and I think you all have\nbrought so much expertise to the table. I appreciate it very\nmuch.\nInstead of asking a question right now at the beginning of\nmy time, I am going to ask Senator Cortez Masto, since she has\nbeen leading this effort and has more skin in the game than any\nof us sitting here, I would like for her to explain a little\nbit what she is trying to achieve right now and how we can be\nof help.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you. Thank you, Ranking Member\nManchin for this opportunity. I know it is rare.\nChairman Murkowski, let me just say the recommendations\nprovided by the Blue Ribbon Commission, I believe, do provide\nus a blueprint to follow, particularly when employing a\nconsent-based method for site selection.\nMy state and what I am simply asking is that the State of\nNevada be included in this framework of this legislation to be\ntreated equally and fairly alongside all the other states. That\nis all we are asking. And I would like to ask you and Ranking\nMember Manchin to work with me as this bill proceeds.\nSenator Manchin. You have my assurance on that and all of\nyou all, I think, have basically expressed in your opening\nstatements that the site selection has to have a buy-in to\nwhere states can either say yea or nay and I think that is\nimportant. But we have to move forward.\nMr. Norton, if I can, I want to make, go back on Senator\nMurkowski. I want to understand the economics of what we are\ndealing with. Do you all get paid by the Federal Government for\nstorage onsite since it never did take the responsibility as\nfar as putting it in a repository?\nMr. Norton. Well, Senator, to be more clear, we have to sue\nto get that money.\nSenator Manchin. You have to sue to get the money.\nMr. Norton. Every five years we sue the Federal Government\nfor the previous four years of storage costs, go through the\nprocess.\nSenator Manchin. Okay, storage costs. You just said you are\nsuing and received $30 million when your actual cost is $6.5\nmillion.\nMr. Norton. I'm sorry, again Senator, I might have confused\nyou. I was trying to be clear. I think the differentiation of\nthe----\nSenator Manchin. Yes, the $23.5 million.\nMr. Norton. The difference between the actual cost to\nsafely and securely store it versus the cost that we have to\nincur at the full cost. So we have, I'm sorry.\nSenator Manchin. The cost you are incurring right now, you\nare incurring that cost by keeping onsite?\nMr. Norton. Yeah, we have an onsite storage component to\nour litigation and----\nSenator Manchin. Is it safe? Do you feel it is safe?\nMr. Norton. It is safe, yes.\nSenator Manchin. And I would assume since it is safe and\nyou are able to do it and we have had no incidents there, then\nthere is no urgency and maybe Congress has dragged its feet for\n30 years for that reason. It hasn't become a critical mass.\nDr. Wagner, you might want to talk on that, would all\nconsider it has been safe storage? I mean, what the\ncorporations are doing?\nDr. Wagner. Yes, your point is exactly right. It has\ncontinued to be safely stored, securely stored. And so----\nSenator Manchin. The public is not threatened?\nDr. Wagner. Exactly right.\nSo that's kind of a bit of a crux of the problem. We don't\nhave a crisis, per se, in terms of safety or security as the\nutility and the private sector has done, you know, an\noutstanding job in terms of safety and security----\nSenator Manchin. I am told, I guess, that some of these\nplants, I mean we have plants coming offline and we are talking\nabout in climate change and we are talking about decarbonizing.\nAnd Bill Gates raised the bar very high in saying, you know,\nyou think it is bad now, wait for another five or ten years,\nthey are going to, we are going to zero. We are not going to\nmore nuclear decarbonization energy. We are going to less.\nSo is it because you are running out of room? You have no\nplace to store it? Your capacity?\nMr. Fettus. No, Senator, it's not because they're running\nout of room.\nDry storage can be improved, and we have a whole set of\nsuggestions on hardened onsite storage that we think would work\nbetter while we get a repository program on track along the\nlines of what the BRC suggested and NRC's suggestion.\nAnd I would urge you, I think it's a long footnote three,\nyour staff can review in our testimony. The actual waste issue,\nhonestly, Senator, has not and is not what is holding up\nnuclear power's ability to compete in the market.\nWhat is holding up nuclear power's ability to compete in\nthe market are its gigantic upfront capital costs. The South\nCarolina reactors that are now in a $9 billion hole in the\nground at Summer and Vogtle, I think, is now pushing $28\nbillion for two new units. The likelihood of building new\nnuclear power is vanishingly unlikely in this country for a\nwhile.\nSenator Manchin. Let me ask this question then.\nThe existing nuclear power we have in decommissioned units\nthat have gone offline, could they have been restored? Could\nthey have been basically improved upon?\nI'm----\nMr. Fettus. It depends on how they went offline.\nMs. Korsnick. The plants that are in the marketplace right\nnow, the merchant plants that you're talking about, they're not\nshutting down relative to used fuel. Used fuel is a necessary\nissue that we need to address.\nSenator Manchin. Sure.\nMs. Korsnick. And as----\nSenator Manchin. Why are they shutting down? Cost?\nMs. Korsnick. It leads to building more nuclear plants and\npeople's concerns about creating additional waste when the\ncurrent waste is not being cared for.\nSenator Manchin. No, I think my question is, is that we are\ndecommissioning some nuclear plants.\nMs. Korsnick. That's correct.\nSenator Manchin. Are they, have they run their life cycle?\nMs. Korsnick. Not all of them, no.\nSenator Manchin. Could they be----\nMs. Korsnick. They're being shut down because in the\nmarketplace right now, the marketplace does not recognize the\ncarbon-free attribute of nuclear. It's competing with----\nSenator Manchin. So there is no value to carbon-free\nnuclear, is what you are saying?\nMs. Korsnick. Not in the marketplace there's not. There\nshould be and that would help.\nSenator Manchin. Are any of these plants in basically\ncontrolled PSCs or basically they are all merchant?\nMs. Korsnick. The ones that are shutting down, for the most\npart, are merchant, not all, but for the most part.\nSenator Manchin. And I think we have gone to the DOE asking\nfor some stability in that.\nMs. Korsnick. That's correct.\nSenator Manchin. Right? And that would be of utmost\nimportance to save some of these plants from going offline.\nMs. Korsnick. It would be very helpful.\nSenator Manchin. Thank you, Madam Chair.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator.\nBefore I turn to Senator Alexander, I wanted to respond to\nSenator Cortez Masto, because you asked a very direct question\nof me.\nKnow that I do understand the importance of this issue to\nyou, your delegation and to your constituency and I want to be\nvery clear that I am very open to working on this bill with\nyou, with Senator Manchin, and any other Senators that are\ninterested in working on it.\nSenator Alexander, Senator Feinstein and I introduced this\nbill understanding that changes are going to be needed to bring\nit in line with current policies. I am aware of the language\nthat you have offered along with Senator Rosen and Senator\nManchin and that you believe it could improve the bill. Know\nthat I look forward to discussing this language with you as we\nare moving forward, because I think we all want to find that\npractical path forward. So I look forward to that.\nLet me turn to Senator Alexander.\nSenator Alexander. Thank you, Madam Chairman, and thanks to\nthe witnesses.\nLet me see if I can get down to what I think the crux of\nthe problem is. We have a world concerned about climate change\nand the effect of carbon emissions on climate change and 60\npercent of the U.S. electricity that is carbon-free is nuclear\npower, and 11 nuclear plants are closing by 2025 and most of\nthem will close over the next several years for a variety of\nreasons and one of the reasons is we have nowhere to put the\nwaste, no place to put the waste offsite which the nuclear law\nrequires we do.\nAs a result of that, President Obama had a Blue Ribbon\nCommission that came up with several ways to move ahead\nincluding a new Yucca Mountain, in effect, a new permanent\nrepository, new interim storage and there are a couple of\nprivate interim storage sites.\nSo there are four places to put this waste that we are\ntalking about, waste that we have collected $40 billion from\nratepayers to store and that we are paying $2.5 million a day\nin damages because we are not doing what the law says we are\nsupposed to do. We have four tracks we could follow to do\nsomething: We could have a Yucca Mountain open, we could build\na new Yucca Mountain, we could have a public interim site, or\nwe could approve a private interim site.\nNow, the reason we don't have any of those is because some\npeople have said that if you can't do Yucca Mountain, you can't\ndo anything else.\nSo I am going to ask each one of you, do you agree with\nthat?\nMs. Korsnick, do you agree that if we can't agree in the\nCongress to proceed ahead with Yucca Mountain, that we should\nstop trying to build a new Yucca Mountain, consent-based, a new\npublic interim site, consent-based, or approving a new private\nsite?\nMs. Korsnick. We need a long-term storage answer as well as\na short-term.\nSenator Alexander. No, that's not my--my question is if we\ncan't do Yucca Mountain should we stop doing anything else?\nShould we stop trying anything else?\nMs. Korsnick. I think we've spent an awful lot of money on\nYucca, and I think it should move forward with----\nSenator Alexander. That is not my question. My question is\nif we can't do Yucca Mountain, which we have not been able to\ndo for 35 years, should we stop doing all the other things that\nthis legislation and the Blue Ribbon Commission said we could\ndo?\nMs. Korsnick. No, we should move forward.\nSenator Alexander. We should move forward.\nMr. Nesbit? Or let me just go down the line. If we can't do\nYucca Mountain, should we stop trying any of these other\ntracks?\nMr. Norton. Senator, we should not.\nMr. Nesbit. I agree, Senator. I also think the country\nshould get a return on the $15 billion.\nSenator Alexander. My question is should we stop if we\ncan't do Yucca Mountain? Should we stop trying any other\nsolution?\nMr. Nesbit. No, sir, we should not stop trying. But we\nshould complete the licensing.\nMr. Fettus. I agree, we should keep trying and we laid out\na pathway in our testimony for you, Senator.\nSenator Alexander. Yes.\nDr. Wagner. No, sir.\nSenator Alexander. Well, I mean, that is the issue in the\nappropriations process. I believe we should finish Yucca\nMountain but what happens is the Senate won't agree to fund the\nnext year's funding of Yucca Mountain which is only to\ndetermine whether it is safe or not. And so, the House won't\nagree to move ahead with a new repository, a new public site, a\nnew private interim site. That does not make any sense at all.\nI mean, we ought to try all four tracks. That is what the Blue\nRibbon Commission said.\nLet me go to the private site. I think the private site is\nthe site that is most likely to be open first, even if we were\nto move ahead with Yucca Mountain.\nMs. Korsnick, the language of the bill that is proposed has\nlanguage that was written for Yucca Mountain which says, ``This\nAct shall not affect any proceeding or any application for any\nlicense or permit pending before the Commission on the date of\nenactment of this Act.'' That basically said we are\nsidestepping Yucca Mountain. We are moving ahead with these\npermanent repository and public interim sites. But today, that\nmight affect the two pending private sites.\nWould it be your opinion that the bill, as written, would\nmean that the provisions of the bill, including the consent-\nbased procedures, would not apply to the pending applications\nfrom New Mexico and Texas for a private site?\nMs. Korsnick. That's how we read it, that they're already\npending applications so they would be excluded.\nSenator Alexander. Anyone else have an opinion on that?\nMr. Fettus. That's precisely right, Senator. You asked the\nright question. Texas and New Mexico would both be barred from\nthe consent process, clearly, by the terms of the bill.\nSenator Alexander. I would assume from your testimony you\nthink they should be?\nMr. Fettus. We think that would put us in precisely the\nsame stalemate that's put us here for 50 years.\nSenator Alexander. Ms. Korsnick, in your testimony you\nthought the private sites, because of the promise they have,\nought to have priority, is that correct?\nMs. Korsnick. We do think they should have priority.\nThe challenge with the private sites right now is they\ndon't want to be the de facto, long-term storage which keeps it\nconnected to a long-term storage answer.\nSenator Alexander. Well, my own view, Madam Chairman and\nMr. Ranking Member, is that the private sites are our best\noption, our fastest option. They should have priority and we\nshould consider whether the consent-based provisions which,\napparently, do not now apply to them, should and if they do,\nwhether that would slow down the private sites which hold so\nmuch promise.\nThank you for your time.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator Alexander.\nI truly appreciate your commitment to working and pushing\nall of us toward solutions here.\nSenator Heinrich.\nSenator Heinrich. Ms. Korsnick, you mentioned that the\nmarket right now just does not value carbon-free nuclear power.\nHas NEI endorsed putting a price on carbon as a way to\nbuild that value into the market?\nMs. Korsnick. Yes, we've had discussions about a variety of\nways to value nuclear in the marketplace. In the states, for\nexample, there are zero emission credits that have been\ndiscussed.\nSenator Heinrich. Right.\nMs. Korsnick. And we have supported that in New York and\nIllinois.\nSenator Heinrich. But have you endorsed putting a price on\ncarbon as a way to pull that in?\nMs. Korsnick. Those zero emission credits actually do,\nplace it----\nSenator Heinrich. As a federal--at the federal level,\nnationally.\nMs. Korsnick. We have conversations around that.\nSenator Heinrich. You have had conversations, but you have\nnot actually taken a position on that?\nMs. Korsnick. From a member perspective there's different\nviews about whether or not a price on carbon would go forward.\nSenator Heinrich. No, I get that. I am just asking what\nyour position is as an organization. Has NEI endorsed putting a\nprice on carbon at the federal level?\nMs. Korsnick. Not an explicit tax on carbon.\nSenator Heinrich. Okay.\nMs. Korsnick. Value on carbon, yes.\nSenator Heinrich. Okay. It is not a complicated question.\nWhy shouldn't the pending sites be part of the consent-\nbased approach when we know that not using a consent-based\nprocess which, by the way, the Blue Ribbon Commission was\nadamant about, has been a path to failure over and over again\nas we see in Nevada.\nMs. Korsnick. Is your question around Nevada specifically?\nSenator Heinrich. No, I am asking why shouldn't pending\napplications also be part of a consent-based approach?\nMs. Korsnick. It was simply reflecting that as written,\nsince it says it's a pending application, that needs to be\nevaluated because they are----\nSenator Heinrich. Yes, so I am not asking about the\nlegislation. I am asking should we use a consent-based process\nfor all applications?\nMs. Korsnick. Yes, we're in support of consent-based\nprocess for applications.\nSenator Heinrich. So, Madam Chair, I guess I am a little\nfrustrated because we have been doing the same thing over and\nover for a long time and not getting somewhere. And I am\nactually, you know, I have spent enough time at a nuclear\nreactor when I was getting my engineering degree that I am\nactually quite proud of the work that I did in one of the\nlarger research reactors in the country.\nBut I think we have heard local input, state input, consent\ncalled just the politics. And I don't think, I think that is a\nmistake because the problem is, we have ignored the politics\nfor decades.\nAnd so, one of the things that is very concerning to me is\nthat if we move forward on interim sites, especially if it is\nwithout consent, and you have a consolidated storage facility\nthat is filled with waste and we never build the permanent\nsite, what recourse is the state going to have if a permanent\ndisposal facility is never built?\nI think we owe it to this conversation to answer those\nquestions before we expect somebody to take possession in what\nwould be a permanent, you know, what could effectively be a\npermanent situation.\nI want to enter a couple of letters into the record. I have\na letter here from Governor Lujan Grisham from New Mexico, and\nI have a letter from the State Land Commission of New Mexico,\nboth objecting to interim storage. I would just ask consent\nthat they be included in the record for the hearing.\nThe Chairman. They will be included as part of the record.\n[Letters objecting to interim storage follow:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nSenator Heinrich. Mr. Fettus, what should consent look\nlike?\nMr. Fettus. Consent should look like regulatory authority,\nas simple as that.\nTo the extent that there has been acceptance in New Mexico\nof WIPP.\nSenator Heinrich. Right.\nMr. Fettus. Transuranic geologic repository, the only\noperating one in the world.\nSenator Heinrich. Why do we have that? Why do we have\nconsent privileges?\nMr. Fettus. The only consent, well, it's a little\ncomplicated and it's not nearly the consent that needs to be\nthere and it's not the full regulatory authority but the state\nhas----\nSenator Heinrich. But the state has----\nMr. Fettus. ----hazardous waste permitting authority and\nthe state can shut the place down and set terms by which it can\noperate after it had a fire and an explosion that shut it down\nand contaminated it for several years.\nSenator Heinrich. And we reopened that facility which, I\nwill repeat, is the only, only, deep geological repository that\nhas been successfully built that I am aware of in this country\nbecause of the state's involvement. And so, I think we need to\nlook at that model and look at what you suggested in terms of a\ndifferent regulatory approach if we are going to get out of\ndoing the same thing and expecting a different outcome.\nMr. Nesbit. Senator, if I could interject.\nI'd just like to point out that I don't agree with Mr.\nFettus' intertwining the concept of regulatory authority with\nconsent. I think you can have consent.\nSenator Heinrich. But I do.\nMr. Nesbit. Okay, fair enough.\nBut I think that the regulatory authority that's present in\nthe United States is--can be handled in a separate manner. I\nthink that consent goes back to contracts.\nAnd if you look at the history of the nuclear waste matter,\nit is only because the generators of nuclear waste entered into\na contract with the Federal Government that was a two-way\ncontract, you pay money and you get something back, the waste\nremoved from your site. That if it wasn't for that contract,\nthen we would be an even a worse situation than we are today.\nThe Chairman. Senator Heinrich, I just want to reiterate\nwhat I mentioned to Senator Cortez Masto. When we introduced\nthis legislation, we did so knowing that we were laying down a\nmarker for conversation because, quite honestly, we need to\nrestart this.\nI appreciate the points that you have raised and they will\nbe part of this ongoing discussion here. I want to make sure\nthat colleagues know and understand, I don't view this bill as\nthe end-all, be-all, but we have to start or restart at some\npoint. So I thank you for that.\nLet's go to Senator Lee.\nSenator Lee. Thank you very much, Madam Chair.\nThe traditional forms of nuclear energy generated a whole\nlot more waste than many of the methods that we are talking\nabout at today's hearing. The sheer volume currently in interim\nstorage around the country and also the lack of a permanent\nstorage or permanent disposal solution are things that are\nfrequently cited as reasons why we should not continue to\ndevelop our nation's nuclear energy capabilities.\nMs. Korsnick, I have a question for you.\nDr. Wagner mentioned several small reactors. How much more\nefficiently would these small reactors use fuel than reactors\nin past decades? And could you describe how these new forms of\ngenerating nuclear energy could possibly change our need for\nnuclear waste storage going forward?\nMs. Korsnick. Yeah, so, I guess as you look forward,\nthere's a variety of different types of small modular reactors\nthat can be built, but some of the types of small modular\nreactors that can be built would actually be interested in\nusing a different type of fuel. And some of that fuel could be,\nin fact, what we consider used fuel today. So in any solution\nset that we put in, we should remind ourselves that we want it\nto be retrievable. There's 95 percent still good energy in what\nwe call used fuel. It's just in a different form. And some of\nthese reactors that are being looked at for tomorrow will be\nable to harvest that energy.\nSenator Lee. And we will be able to use it far below that\n95 percent threshold that you described.\nMs. Korsnick. That's correct.\nSenator Lee. How low would they go?\nMs. Korsnick. They should be able to use the majority of\nthat good energy. I would say, you know, you'll be down to\nmaybe the four to five percent ``that's left'' that would then\nneed to be stored.\nSenator Lee. Okay.\nAnd that brings up another topic. I don't know whether that\nplays into what happens then. Could it be reprocessed or\nrecycled? Is there another means of dealing with our need to\nhave a disposal site for spent fuel that could be addressed\nthrough recycling or reprocessing?\nIt is my understanding that other countries that have\nrelied on nuclear energy recycle their waste and that the U.S.\nhas even developed the technology to do so here in the United\nStates in a way that is deemed safe and clean.\nCan you describe the process of how nuclear fuel is\nrecycled and the history of why this process has been banned in\nthe United States?\nMs. Korsnick. Sure, so it, sort of, goes back to when we\nsaid there's a 95 percent still good energy in what we call\nused fuel. It's transformed. And so, instead of being, say\nuranium 235, it's turned into uranium 238 or it's turned into\nplutonium 239. So those isotopes can still release energy but\nthey, not in the current way in our current light water\nreactors.\nSo in recycling what you do is you essentially take the\nfuel apart and you isolate what's good and can be used again.\nSo that uranium, that plutonium, and it can then be mixed and\nyou can use it in current reactors, that's called MOX fuel, or\nyou can use it for other types of reactors. So again, it, sort\nof, closes the fuel cycle, if you will.\nYou're left with a very small amount that is not useful in\na fuel and France, as an example, reprocesses their fuel. They\nturn that into a glass and then you store that inert glass.\nSenator Lee. So the glass is inert?\nMs. Korsnick. That's correct.\nSenator Lee. It is not fissile at that moment, it is not\nemitting----\nMs. Korsnick. It's radioactive, but it's not useful for\nfuel.\nSenator Lee. Okay.\nMs. Korsnick. So it's stored in accordance with--it would\nbe in a deep geologic situation, but it would be a very small\namount.\nSenator Lee. So it reduces the overall volume of what is\nproduced?\nMs. Korsnick. That's correct. That's correct.\nSenator Lee. So why wouldn't we do that?\nMs. Korsnick. So in the United States, we've chosen not to.\nWe've chosen the fact that, and this was made in the Carter\nAdministration days, that the fact of reprocessing, they look\nat it as potential proliferation, even though there are many\nprocesses and things you could put in place to ensure that it's\ndone without any kind of proliferation concerns. But that's why\nthe United States doesn't currently go for reprocessing today.\nSenator Lee. So if that decision was made in the Carter\nAdministration, we are talking about 40 years ago or more.\nMs. Korsnick. That's correct.\nSenator Lee. What has changed since then that might cause\nus to need to reconsider that? Has the technology changed in\nsuch a way that what was perceived as dangerous would no\nlonger, necessarily, be deemed dangerous?\nMs. Korsnick. Well, I mean, I think we've proven on a lot\nof fronts that we have the capability of managing significant\nthings. The government manages plutonium on a regular basis, so\nit obviously can be done and can be done safely.\nSenator Lee. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nThank you, Madam Chair.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator.\nSenator Cortez Masto.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you, Madam Chair.\nFirst, I would like to enter into the record an analysis of\nthis bill made by the Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects and a\nstatement expressing concerns of this bill by my Nevada\ncolleague, Senator Jacky Rosen.\nThe Chairman. Those will be included as part of the record.\n[Analysis and Rosen statement follow:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you.\nI am sorry Senator Alexander had to leave. I do agree with\nhim. I think we need a comprehensive approach here. I think we\nneed to--it is safely stored what I am hearing now, spent\nnuclear fuel, and it is safely stored where it is. But we do\nneed a comprehensive approach for the future.\nBut here is the one thing that I am seeking and this is why\nI so respect Senator Alexander. In 1987, I believe it was,\nTennessee was able to successfully remove the Oak Ridge\nfacility as an interim storage facility, change the law, and\nnow in this bill Tennessee has equally the opportunity to say\nno like every other state, except Nevada. That is all I am\nlooking for, in my state, are those similar opportunities,\nparticularly with this bill it creates an equal consent-based\nsiting process for all states, except for Nevada.\nAnd let me just highlight for the record, Section 306(e)\nrequires the potential host state to veto or approve a site\nbefore they are fully informed of a site's local impact prior\nto initiating a review licensing process. That essentially\nleaves Yucca Mountain as the default sole repository. Section\n506(a) gives parity to all other states, except for Yucca\nMountain in Nevada, which the consent-based process would not\nbe applied to, but would be applied to states such as New\nMexico, Texas and Utah to be kept on the list without requiring\ntheir consent. And Section 509 eliminates the legal 70,000\nmetric ton limit of waste to be stored at a repository so if no\nstate wants to be a host, this guarantees all the waste goes to\nYucca Mountain.\nMy request is that we all be treated equally. I so\nappreciate, again, the conversation today. That is why Jacky\nRosen and I have submitted these recommended amendments to the\nCommittee to this bill that treats Nevada equally.\nLet me start with some of the questions and comments that I\nhave heard today.\nFirst of all, Mr. Fettus, let me ask you this. If we are to\nmove forward in a comprehensive approach, and I think we have\nall agreed that we do need that approach, what is the best way\nto rebuild the American people's confidence in the Federal\nGovernment's ability to provide safe, long-term storage of\nhigh-level nuclear waste?\nMr. Fettus. I think you've targeted the right issue,\nSenator, and that is confidence. And I'd also put it as trust.\nAnd we certainly support your idea of getting everybody treated\nequally under the consent.\nWe would take it a step farther in that if we just keep the\ncurrent system of trying to keep it as consent, everyone will\njust say no because the entire burden is on. That's what we're\ntrying to build, is a process where states and EPA can have\ntrust and confidence and say yes in our process. And that's the\nspecific point of our testimony.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you.\nMs. Korsnick, would NEI support the new Nuclear Waste\nAdministration Act, as created in this bill, if the NWA walked\naway from the Yucca Mountain project and demonstrated that a\nnew repository project could be done more efficiently and\nrapidly than Yucca Mountain? Yes or no?\nMs. Korsnick. Well, I guess I would reflect to say that we\nbelieve that Nevada does have a say in the process by\ncontinuing with the conversations around Yucca.\nSenator Cortez Masto. That was not my question. My question\nwas this. Under this Act, would the NEI support this Act if the\nNWA walked away from the Yucca Mountain project and\ndemonstrated that a new repository project could be done more\nefficiently and rapidly than Yucca Mountain? Would you support\nthat?\nMs. Korsnick. I don't see how another process could be done\nmore rapidly with all of the analysis that's already been done\non Yucca. But if you found such a magic place, yes, we could\nbe----\nSenator Cortez Masto. Well, DOE studies have shown that\nwalking away from Yucca Mountain and starting over with a\nrepository in salt or shale could save billions of dollars over\nthe life of the facility.\nSo, and this is the challenge I have had. We have had a\nstalemate over the last 32 years, and we have offered the\nopportunity to come in and work with us and find a solution for\nit. I think you have that today, but unfortunately what I see\nfrom the industry is the same old playbook and not willing to\neven admit there is an opportunity to move forward. There is\nnot even a willingness to talk about the potential new\ntechnology that can be utilized to address the safe storage,\nand that is my concern.\nWe need time now for everybody to come together and move\nforward on this issue.\nMs. Korsnick. We're happy to have those conversations.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator.\nSenator Risch.\nSenator Risch. Well, Madam Chairman, thank you for holding\nthis hearing today.\nYou know, I joined this Committee 11 years ago and we were\ntalking about this then. Unfortunately the discussion today\ndoes not sound a whole lot different than it did 11 years ago.\nThe Chairman. That is going to change.\nSenator Risch. Okay, going to change, thank you, Madam\nChairman and maybe your bill will get us there.\nFirst of all, let me say thank you for inviting Mr. Wagner\nhere. He is really the appropriate person to have here, which I\nwill address in a second.\nI am also sorry that Senator Alexander left, because I was\ngoing to say he is the smartest guy on the panel. He left\nTennessee and moved to Idaho and worked at Oak Ridge for 17\nyears, was it, Dr. Wagner? And now he is working at Idaho.\nSenator King. You are lucky Senator Alexander didn't hear\nthat.\nSenator Risch. Yes, oh, he will hear it.\n[Laughter.]\nAnyway, it is appropriate that he be here because the Idaho\nNational Laboratory, of course, is the birthplace of nuclear\nenergy in America and in the world, indeed.\nWe still have the three light bulbs that we lit, the first\nthree light bulbs lit with nuclear energy there. We don't use\nthem regularly, but they are still there.\nIn any event, because they were the birthplace of nuclear\nenergy, the site has been used for decades for various things\nin the nuclear energy business and in the nuclear arms\nbusiness. We became a waste site for a lot of the waste that\nwas developed during the Cold War.\nBut my point is this. In about the 1970s the State of Idaho\nwas unhappy with the Department of Energy because they were not\nproperly addressing, in our belief, that the waste should be\nhandled properly. As a result of that, we, in Idaho, sued the\nDepartment of Energy and eventually entered into a consent\ndecree with the Federal Government for cleanup at the Idaho\nNational Lab. And all of us who were governors following that\nstood shoulder-to-shoulder behind that agreement and have\nexecuted that agreement. And the Department of Energy, although\nrecalcitrant at the beginning, has now embraced the agreement.\nOf course, there has been a lot of turnover with the people who\nwere involved and everything. But the bottom line is this. We\nhave been very successful at the Idaho National Lab as far as\ncleanup is concerned. We have addressed virtually every problem\nthere successfully. We're not done yet.\nIsn't that correct, Dr. Wagner? Are we--we are a long ways\ndown the road though, fair statement?\nDr. Wagner. Absolutely.\nSenator Risch. Yes.\nAnd so, it is important that the people who have, and we\nhave had thousands of people, great people, over the years from\nall over the United States, from Idaho, who have worked on this\nand who are really smart at this. And we have proven that you\ncan deal with nuclear waste and it can be cleaned up and it can\nbe put into storage, semi-permanent, some temporary. But it has\nbeen done.\nSo it is discouraging after sitting here all these years\nand not really having moved the ball very far down the field.\nWe have done that in Idaho. This is a serious problem, but my\ngood friend from New Mexico says we have ignored the politics.\nGosh, I would really disagree with that. I mean, it becomes a\npolitical issue every time there is a Presidential campaign and\nNevada is in play, that becomes a political issue. So, and it\nis also true here. I have seen it over the years as the Senate\nraces develop in Nevada.\nThere has to be a better way of doing this and I thank you\nfor holding this hearing. Just as Dr. Wagner has done in Idaho,\nas we have done in Idaho, I think there is a solution but we\nare going to have to come together to do it. And hopefully,\nthis bill will start the conversation.\nSo thank you so much for the hearing.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator.\nWe really do not want this to be deja vu all over again. It\nhas been three Congresses now and, in the meantime, whether it\nis Yankee, it does not make any difference where you are, we\nhave not been able to address the longer-term issues that must\nbe addressed and folks are looking to us for that legislative\ndirection.\nWe have an obligation to do it. Just because it is hard and\njust because it is politically charged, just because it's\nexpensive--$2.2 million a day that is just, kind of, going out\nthe window--is not helping anybody.\nLet's go to Senator King.\nSenator Risch. You know, Madam Chairman.\nThe Chairman. Go ahead.\nSenator Risch. You hit on a good note about the fact that\nwe have an obligation to do this. It is discouraging to see\nthat the nuclear energy business is going backward, that has\nbeen described by everybody here. Not only in America but all\nover the world people are backing away from nuclear energy and\nplants are closing. Some have reached the end of their life,\nsome that have not. And yet, at the same time, there is this\ntremendous push to try to get carbon out of the air and quit\ndischarging carbon in the air.\nAnd look, solar and wind are great generators, but they\njust do not deliver the load. At some point in time, the carbon\nfuels will run out and nuclear is going to be there. It may not\nbe in this century, but future human beings on the planet are\ngoing to rely, very heavily, on nuclear. It is up to us to come\nup with this, resolving this bottleneck that is causing us so\nmuch problem.\nThank you, Madam Chair.\nThe Chairman. I appreciate that. I think we all agree that\nnuclear should be a strong part of our mix.\nBut just as we are seeing facilities that are being shut\ndown, what that then does to the workforce is it, too,\ndissipates and we lose the leadership that we once had. We once\nused to lead when it came to the manufacturing of nuclear\ncomponents. We basically ceded that in so many different areas.\nWe can't lose the workforce along with that.\nLet's go to Senator King.\nSenator King. Thank you, Madam Chair.\nI experienced and saw a similar thing happen in hydro.\nMajor hydro developments were pretty much done in the '20s and\nwhen we got back into hydro in the '80s a lot of the expertise\nwas gone, a lot of the engineers. There were very few firms\nthat really knew how to do it. A lot of the technology was\nstuck in almost a century old.\nI find this one of the most difficult issues, and I can\nargue it both ways.\nMr. Fettus, you present an appealing plan, state-based----\nMr. Fettus. Thank you.\nSenator King. ----consent-based--yes, I haven't finished\nyet.\n[Laughter.]\nDon't get excited.\nState-based, consent-based, getting rid of the exemptions,\ntreating it like other pollutants.\nHowever, what if every state says no? Which, I think, is\nnot unlikely. I lived through in the '80s an effort to even\ndiscuss a low-level nuclear site in Maine and the outcry was\nunbelievable. What if every state says no, where are we then?\nMr. Fettus. The same place we are now. And we have to try,\njust as Senator Murkowski is, I think, wisely leading this with\na very open mind.\nThe reason why everyone has said no repeatedly, no matter\nwho it is, whether it was then Governor Alexander in Tennessee\nor the fine State of Utah with the PFS site. We actually have a\nconsolidated interim storage facility that's licensed in this\ncountry right now that will never receive a gram of waste and\nthe Committee is well aware of that and it's in Utah.\nSenator Hatch helped put in a wilderness area in order to\nblock it from ever receiving that waste.\nThe problem, and then I really appreciated the talk of the\nCommittee that it's not just about politics. Politics are how\nwe actually----\nSenator King. Politics are an expression of the public\nwill.\nMr. Fettus. Right.\nSenator King. I don't like it when somebody says we are not\ngoing to let politics block these things. That is the public\nspeaking.\nMr. Fettus. I couldn't agree more. And we have to take\naccount of that.\nAnd the way we've done that remarkably in this country with\nall kinds of difficult and controversial issues are through our\nbedrock environmental statutes where we have a strong EPA that\nsets a strong foundational floor of protective standards and\nthen states have delegated programs whether it's air, water,\nsomething else. If you build a widget factory, Senator King's\nwidget factory, and you have a set of methyl-ethyl death that\ngets emitted from your factory. If your--the state can actually\nprotect its citizens, its environment, its waterways, whatever.\nSenator King. Okay, but let me--assume for a moment my\nhypothetical, that we can't find a state that says yes. They\nall say no. Then, as you say, we are back where we are now. We\nhave 80 so-called temporary sites. We have one in Maine costing\nus $10 million a year, costing the ratepayers and the Federal\nGovernment, the ratepayers through the Federal Government, $10\nmillion a year. That is, sort of, the fallback.\nMr. Fettus. Well, can I do my quota, my time?\nSenator King. You don't have a countdown clock in front of\nyou. You can do it if you can do it quickly.\nMr. Fettus. Super-fast.\nSenator King. I am running out of time.\nMr. Fettus. We have a vastly higher chance of actually\nhaving states get to yes if they don't have to take the entire\nburden. It also solves some of the transportation issues. They\ncan do regional. They can do state.\nSenator King. Well, regional is better than one national\nanyway because of transportation.\nMr. Fettus. Correct.\nSenator King. But the transportation routes to Nevada are,\nI have seen them, I mean, Chicago, Kansas City.\nMr. Fettus. Almost every Congressional district.\nAnd but the idea----\nSenator King. And it would be two or three trains a week\nfor years to take care of what we have.\nMr. Fettus. Correct. Yup.\nSenator King. Okay.\nMr. Nesbit. Senator, if I could interject----\nSenator King. Yes?\nMr. Nesbit. ----that part of the problem with consent is\nwho consents?\nIf you look at the current situation in Nevada right now,\nthe people who live closest to the repository have expressed\ntheir political consent for the facility there. But when you\nadd----\nSenator King. I think the lady who sits next to me knows\nmore about what the people of Nevada feel about----\nMr. Nesbit. I understand that, but what I was going to add\nis when you add the additional level of government in between\nat the state level, it becomes very difficult. And no one in\nthe world has solved that conundrum to date.\nSenator King. Well and I understand that. That is why I\nasked my question, what if everyone says no? Because I don't\nthink that is totally unlikely.\nLet me ask a totally different question, a technical\nquestion.\nWhy is it that we are talking about now, forever and\nalways, deep holes, mines? We have these sites around the\ncountry, like in Maine Yankee, that you all have said are safe.\nWhy not use an interim technology instead of we have to solve\nit forever, something that will allow technology to develop\nover the next 20 to 30 years and yet still be safe at a more\ncentralized site? It bothers me that we have 80 sites. I don't\nthink that is very secure.\nMr. Nesbit. I think there's a couple of things there,\nSenator.\nOne is that if you don't have a permanent solution, the\nability to convince a particular location, as we've talked\nabout at this hearing, to accept all this waste----\nSenator King. But if the Maine Yankee site is safe, why not\na larger, similar site that has the same technology you are\ntelling me everybody says is safe, as an interim step until we\nfigure out what the best--I don't understand why we have to go\nfrom 80 temporary to permanent. Isn't there a step in between\nthat is a logical piece?\nMs. Korsnick. Well, that's what consolidated interim\nstorage is.\nSenator King. That is what I am talking about.\nMs. Korsnick. Yeah. And the challenge is nobody wants to\nsign up for consolidated interim storage.\nYou mentioned New Mexico. The governor just recently wrote\na letter. The last New Mexico Governor was in support of\ninterim storage. The current New Mexico governor, not.\nAnd the challenge is because they don't want to become the\nlong-term repository. And until there is an idea of a long-term\nrepository, anybody that raises their hands for their\nconsolidated interim storage is de facto, the long-term----\nSenator King. I think that is a good point because these\ntemporary sites are now the de facto long-term sites.\nMr. Norton. That's correct.\nMr. Fettus. Senator, though, the actual problem we also\nface, and the Obama Administration tried to look at deep\nborehole disposal in South Dakota toward the end of its second\nterm and it turned into an absolute debacle where this is red\nstate South Dakota was objecting.\nAnd it gets precisely to the reasons that we've articulated\ntoday which is that when you're outside of the major functions\nor the normal functioning of environmental law, states have no\ncontrol. So South Dakota erupted, just as New Mexico has, just\nas Nevada has been fighting for 35 years. And when you don't\nfix the institutional framework to allow the process to get to\nyes, we're never going to solve this.\nMr. Nesbit. But I think it's important to recognize that a\nprivate company did conduct a deep drill hole test\nsuccessfully. And I think what that points to is the need to\nget the management of the waste program away from the\nDepartment of Energy and put it into a single purpose.\nSenator King. Which is what you are suggesting.\nMr. Nesbit. Focused organization that is dedicated to\nactual success and we have submitted in our comments, in our\ntestimony, comments along those lines.\nAnd I think it goes----\nSenator King. The bill makes sense, but it bothers me that,\nas I understand it, the bill essentially says this is the way\nwe are going to proceed except Yucca Mountain is still on a\ndifferent track that does not require consent.\nAnyway, Madam Chairman, thank you. This is a very important\nhearing. I appreciate your conducting it.\nThe Chairman. Yes, thank you, Senator King.\nI am going to turn to Senator Manchin, who has to excuse\nhimself from the Committee here.\nSenator Manchin. I do, and I appreciate it so much.\nI just want to have clarification, because something is not\nmaking a lot of sense to me.\nYou are telling me we are not filled up onsite right now so\nwherever the nuclear plants are, they are still able to have\ncapacity to keep that storage there. Is that accurate?\nMr. Nesbit. Senator, we can continue to expand onsite\nstorage as needed.\nSenator Manchin. So we are not at critical mass there?\nI kind of thought we were. I was led to believe that we had\nto do something immediately.\nMr. Fettus. We are in the pools at several sites, Senator.\nSenator Manchin. Okay.\nMr. Fettus. In the spent fuel pools.\nMr. Norton. If I could, Senator, what I'd like to add to\nthat, however, is if you've got sites like mine where the\nreactor is fully decommissioned, all the spent fuel that's ever\ngoing to be generated at that site has been generated at that\nsite. And yet, we sit there loaded, ready to be transported,\nwaiting for some----\nSenator Manchin. I understand. I am going to get to that\nnext, because now you are talking about going to interim sites.\nThat doesn't make any sense to me at all because an interim\nsite has to be transported again to a permanent site.\nMr. Nesbit. Well, Senator, I would like to add and, in my\ntestimony, I pointed this out, I'd like to note the difference\nbetween perceived risk and actual risk. And transportation of\nnuclear material is an area where perceived risk is orders of\nmagnitude greater than the actual risk.\nSenator Manchin. The only thing I am saying is it looks\nlike you are just creating a business model for the interim\nsince we have to get to permanent.\nSo why would you have these paying privately?\nMs. Korsnick. It's really--it's all about timing.\nMr. Nesbit. The advantage of interim is an economy of\nstate.\nMs. Korsnick. It's just a timing issue.\nIf you decided today on a long-term repository site, by the\ntime you license it, let's just select Yucca since we've talked\nabout it, that would still be another three to five years just\nto license it today because all of the analysis has been done.\nAnd there's additional hearings that have to happen. Nevada has\nto have their say.\nSenator Manchin. But if we are not at capacity, why would\nwe have an interim site? If it is going to be three to five\nyears?\nMs. Korsnick. That's just to get your license. It's going\nto be another decade to build it, alright. So you're already\ntalking you have 15 years if you were on go today. Thirty-five\nbillion is what your obligation is today, and in 15 years it's\ngoing to be closer to $50 billion.\nSo you have to manage the liability that you are building\non a daily basis, and the best way to help manage that\nliability is that interim storage because once you start taking\nthat fuel offsite, eventually that judgment fund comes down\nbecause you don't have to pay the judgment fee because you've\ntaken the fuel in an interim state.\nSenator Manchin. How far along are we on permitting the\ninterim sites?\nMs. Korsnick. You're nowhere.\nSenator Manchin. So whether we started today with interim\nor permanent, it is the same timetable.\nMr. Nesbit. There's two sites that have applications in but\nwhether they will actually go forward and construct those sites\nis an open question at this point.\nMr. Fettus. Senator, there are applications but as Senator\nHeinrich just entered into the record, there will be a\nferocious pushback for all the reasons that I've articulated\ntoday. And I couldn't agree more with the lack of wisdom of\npursuing an interim site that's likely to become a de facto\nrepository that doesn't solve what you and Senator Murkowski\nare trying to solve which is the long-term trajectory of how to\nsolve this.\nMr. Nesbit. Senator, the advantage of an interim site is\nthat if you provide security and monitoring at one location\nversus dozens of locations, there are economies of scale\nadvantages for doing that if you're going to do it for a long\nperiod of time.\nMr. Norton. That's correct.\nSenator Manchin. Thank you.\nThe Chairman. Senator Cantwell.\nSenator Cantwell. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thanks for\nhaving this important hearing. I can say for the State of\nWashington, there is probably no more important discussion than\nthe cleanup and disposal of high-level nuclear waste.\nAnd for a state that did what it was asked of us and the\npeople that were there in the development of Hanford, to the\npeople who have done their best at cleanup, we too want to get\nanswers to this.\nI guess, I have been listening to most of the hearing, in\nand out of other things, but I agree with Senator Alexander\nthat moving forward is a very necessary and positive thing. And\nI would say count me in the camp of the belief that consensus-\nbased approaches are more likely to generate quicker results\nthan the legal and long process that we have to continue to\nplay out. And that is even to say if you pass legislation, it\njust does not mean you have cleared the legal hurdles that\ncontinue to stymie us in these debates.\nSo one of the things that Senator Alexander and others have\nreferred to, and some of the witnesses have had the Blue Ribbon\nCommission and, in their discussion, our former colleague, the\nlate Senator Pete Domenici, a member of that.\nOne of the things that I liked about the Commission\nrecommendations was that they thought that separating\ncommercial and defense waste and dealing with that separately\nmight be one of those near-term opportunities to make more\nprogress.\nMr. Fettus or anybody else, do you have a thought on\ncontinuing to look at that as a path forward?\nMr. Fettus. I think that's a secondary issue, Senator,\nbecause I think fixing the----\nSenator Cantwell. Well, it is not secondary to us because\nwe are the ones waiting. I forgot to put the big moniker out\nhere. This is the largest nuclear waste cleanup site in the\nentire world.\nMr. Fettus. Agreed.\nSenator Cantwell. It is complex. It is hard. We are making\nprogress, but we need to get the high-level waste out.\nSo let's come up with a process of moving the defense waste\nout. The complexity of Senator Feinstein's concerns on the\ncommercial side are going to take us a long time to figure out.\nJust like Hanford is cleaning up some easy to clean up\nthings and getting to the harder things, why can't we move\nforward on defense?\nMr. Fettus. I think the challenge with the defense waste\ngetting to a repository is going to be the same as the\nchallenge with commercial spent nuclear fuel--that if you don't\nhave the statutory and regulatory process that can allow\nconsent in getting to yes, you won't solve it.\nThat's why I meant it a second ago----\nSenator Cantwell. I am saying, we are saying the same\nthing.\nMr. Fettus. Yup.\nSenator Cantwell. I want a consent process that is faster.\nIf they will take that, I am just saying, streamline defense so\nit can get done faster as you deal with all the other aspects.\nMr. Fettus. If you can get all the waste out of the tanks\nand get it vitrified and get it ready, that would be great.\nSenator Cantwell. Well, this is, believe me, a day-to-day\ntask----\nMr. Fettus. Yes.\nSenator Cantwell. ----for us in the State of Washington,\nbut we are only doing it on behalf of the entire United States\nand part of stewardship. This should be every member of this\nCommittee's responsibility. This is a responsibility of the\nUnited States of America, not just the State of Washington or\nenvironmental director.\nBut I will tell you as we fight every time on some idea\nthat is shortchanging the cleanup process or an idea, we are\ndesperate to move the defense waste in a way in which people\nare saying to us, we want it and we will take it and we want to\nexplore those ideas and see if we cannot move forward.\nSo thank you, Madam Chair.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator Cantwell.\nSenator Barrasso.\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you very much, Madam Chairman. It\nis good to be here. I want to thank you and Ranking Member\nManchin for holding this important hearing this morning.\nThis Congress, this Committee has discussed exciting and\ninnovative ways to address climate change. We have explored\ncarbon capture technologies, renewable resources and advanced\nnuclear power and nuclear energy.\nIn several of the hearings, witnesses have stressed that\nnuclear energy is an essential part of our clean energy\nportfolio. If we are serious about addressing climate change,\nwe must be serious about preserving and expanding the use of\nnuclear energy. We cannot do it without nuclear energy. So the\nlack of a nuclear waste management program limits the use and\nthe expansion of nuclear power.\nIn May, I chaired an Environment and Public Works Committee\nhearing on my discussion draft legislation that would\ncomplement and could complement Senator Murkowski and Senator\nAlexander's nuclear waste legislation.\nEight states right now have new bans, bans on new nuclear\nuntil Washington permanently disposes of nuclear waste.\nCommunities across the country are struggling to accept new\nnuclear plants because there is no permanent pathway to remove\nthe nuclear waste.\nI am glad this Committee is holding this hearing to address\nthese challenges.\nMs. Korsnick and Mr. Nesbit, American ratepayers have now\npaid about $15 billion to site, to study and to design a\nrepository for the Yucca Mountain site. And of this funding,\n$200 million was paid to the State of Nevada to develop their\nown scientific and technical analysis.\nMs. Korsnick, why is it important for the Nuclear\nRegulatory Commission to complete the independent safety review\nof the proposed Yucca Mountain repository?\nMs. Korsnick. Well, you just mentioned the significant\nmoney that has been expended. We should have a fair hearing\nand, quite frankly, give Nevada a chance to have their hearing.\nThe process will require that it goes through the judges,\net cetera, through the licensing process and for all this money\nthat has been expended, let's understand the science and the\nlicensing process and work ourself through it.\nIn the future, we might need another long-term repository,\nso let's learn everything that we can and understand the\nscience and the licensing process for the one that's so far\nalong.\nSenator Barrasso. Following up on that, Mr. Nesbit, why is\nit important----\nMr. Nesbit. I knew what you meant.\nSenator Barrasso. Okay.\nYou note that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Yucca\nMountain licensing review is valuable. And it is valuable to\ninform safety regulations for a different repository site.\nIs it also important to complete the pending licensing\nprocess to build that public trust?\nMr. Nesbit. Absolutely. I agree with everything that Ms.\nKorsnick said.\nThere's other reasons why it is beneficial for the American\npeople to go forward and complete the licensing even if Yucca\nMountain isn't built. I mean, we don't know what the answer is\nuntil we do it. I mean, if something is found that said this is\nnot the right place to do it, we've got to go find another\nsolution. But we need to go through the process in order to\ndemonstrate the ability to license a geologic repository for\nused fuel and high-level radioactive waste here in the United\nStates. We're going to learn a great number of lessons from\nthat. And having invested $15 billion already, I think it only\nmakes sense to get a little more return for that huge\ninvestment.\nAnd the only other thing I'll say along those lines is it\nis the law that we do that. I think that if we demonstrate that\nwe're going to follow the law here, if we change the law and do\nsomething different later, then people will believe that we'll\nfollow the law there too.\nSenator Barrasso. Okay.\nAlong those lines, back to you, Ms. Korsnick.\nLike Senator Murkowski's bill, my Nuclear Waste Discussion\nDraft allows the Secretary of Energy to partner with private\ncompanies to store spent nuclear fuel on an interim basis. Mr.\nNesbit just talked about other sites. The draft requires the\ninterim storage program to proceed at the same time as the\nNuclear Regulatory Commission's review of the Yucca Mountain\nlicense application.\nDo you support a requirement that interim storage is\nconnected to tangible action on a permanent repository for\nnuclear waste?\nMs. Korsnick. Yes, in fact, we think it enables that\ninterim storage because people will see, alright, you have this\npath for a long-term answer. I'm happy to participate in your\nshorter-term answer because I understand that this pathway\nexists.\nSenator Barrasso. Finally to Dr. Wagner, if I could.\nThe Idaho National Lab is a leader, a real leader, in\ndeveloping advanced nuclear technologies. It is also the\nproposed site of the nation's first small modular reactor which\nis going to provide nuclear power to the intermountain West.\nAdvanced nuclear reactors can increase safety, I believe,\ncan decrease cost, can reduce the amount of nuclear waste. So\nwhile advanced nuclear can reduce nuclear waste, will there\nstill be nuclear waste products that must be permanently\ndisposed of?\nDr. Wagner. Yeah, the short answer is yes.\nThere's a variety of advanced reactor concepts that can\nsignificantly increase fuel utilization. There's also different\nconcepts that Maria spoke about earlier that close the nuclear\nfuel cycle through reprocessing. But at the end of the day\nthere are always going to be some small amount of material that\nrequires deep geological repository.\nSenator Barrasso. Yes, thank you. Thank you, Madam\nChairman.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator.\nI was going to ask a question about what is the number? How\nmany additional storage facilities, long-term repositories, do\nwe need?\nAs I am thinking about that, it is like, well, we don't\nknow because of exactly what you have said, Dr. Wagner, moving\nforward. What will the future of nuclear bring to us in terms\nof advanced nuclear and the prospect for less waste?\nWe have talked about reprocessing. I think we know what we\nknow today, but the innovation, that is out there is still\nevolving, if you will. The view into the deep boreholes. We may\nbe looking at Yucca as okay, this is the design for what we\nneeded 20 years ago but is it the design that we need going\nforward? And so, I think we need to factor that into the\ncalculus.\nThe question for those of you who have looked at the\nlegislation that we have laid down here as our working\ndocument, do you think we do enough in this proposed\nlegislation to be specific about the type of research and\ndevelopment that DOE or the Administration needs to move\nforward on? Do we need to do more in that we have been talking\nso much about this whole consent-based process and the interim\nand moving to permanent, but we have not really talked about\nsome of the context of this bill that can move the industry\nforward. Do we have enough in there? Do we need to do more?\nMr. Norton?\nMr. Norton. Yes, Senator, if I could.\nMadam Chairman, a couple things I wanted to reflect on in\nyour question, and I had this conversation with Maria's\npredecessor, Marv Fertel, probably six or seven years ago when\nmy sites and the other decommissioning plant coalition sites,\nat the time there were five of us, were kind of the poster\nchildren of this problem, right?\nThe Chairman. Right.\nMr. Norton. We operated the plant. We've decommissioned the\nplant. We're waiting.\nI told him at that point in time there was less focus on it\nboth at NEI and the industry than there is today, but I did\ntell him on the path we're at then and potentially the path\nwe're on now, more than 50 percent of our nuclear fleet will be\nin the same condition I'm in before we solve this problem if we\nkeep trying the same thing we've been trying for the last 20\nyears. And I don't think he believed me. But if he was watching\nit today, with the number of plants that have either shut down\nor announced shut down, my estimate is not going to be far off,\neven if we get moving from here.\nAnd so, it is a clear problem. It is a clear issue. I think\nSenate bill 1234, although we have comments that would make\nrecommendations on changes, is a good starting point for us to\nwork together to figure out how to resolve this problem because\nwhat we have been doing for the last 20 years is not going to\nwork.\nI would also like to acknowledge my Senator from Maine,\nSenator King, and his question about are we really thinking\nabout this the right way? And I think that needs to be asked.\nI know there's scientists and others that may have a\ndifference of opinion here, but I do think we have to challenge\nourselves as to did we really plot the right course with our\noriginal plan for a repository and is there an alternative way\nto think about this? By consolidating this waste, looking at\neither reprocessing or other technical advancements, other\noptions that other countries are looking at and take the\nblinders off and look at this more holistically.\nThe Chairman. I appreciate that.\nMr. Nesbit.\nMr. Nesbit. Senator, I'd just like to add a couple of\nthings.\nOne is American Nuclear Society does support continued\nresearch into advanced nuclear energy systems and advanced\nwaste management techniques. There's actually private companies\nout there that are working in this area as well.\nI think the question of where that needs to reside, whether\nit's in your bill or in other legislation is a good question. I\nthink the work that John Wagner and others are doing at Idaho\nis, they are looking at advanced energy systems in a holistic\nmanner that includes the waste management issue, and I think\nthey need to continue that work.\nThe Chairman. Got it.\nMr. Fettus.\nMr. Fettus. And Senator, the Blue Ribbon Commission wisely\ncautioned against trusting in reprocessing as any meaningful\nsolution for nuclear waste and the offramp, it's past time for\nthe offramp on recycling of spent fuel in this country. It's\nboth dangerous proliferation and security concerns. It creates\nmore waste and it will not solve the waste problem, and no\ncountry has used it to solve their waste problem. And most of\nall, it's not economical and the BRC identified that it likely\nnever will be.\nThe Chairman. Dr. Wagner, you want to respond to that?\nDr. Wagner. Well, I would just comment that, you know, we\ndon't currently recycle because it's not economical.\nYou know, one of the many benefits talked about with\nrespect to consolidated interim storage is that whether in time\nit becomes economical with a substantial growth in nuclear\nenergy or other technologies for waste disposal and design of\nrepositories come into play. A consolidated interim storage\nfacility allows you to make progress to move forward on this\nissue while some of those other things may or may not come to\nbe other options for the material.\nThe Chairman. I appreciate that.\nWe have just had a vote start. I would like to allow my\ncolleagues an opportunity for a last word, if they would like.\nSenator Cortez Masto.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Actually, I do, thank you, Madam\nChair.\nMr. Nesbit, I sat here and listened to you. Thank you for\nbeing here. The arguments you make are the same arguments I\nhave heard for the last 30 years from the industry. But you\nmake one argument that talks about Yucca Mountain being\nutilized to learn from the science and that is why it should\nmove forward. I think we should learn from the science from\nYucca Mountain because there are no natural barriers or man-\nmade barriers that make it safe. But we keep hearing that all\nthe time.\nSo let me ask you this, if we were to learn from the\nscience of Yucca Mountain which would require still 40 more\nmiles of tunnel to be, to dig the tunnel to bury the canisters,\nwhich by the way, the same canisters that are utilized for\nYucca Mountain in the study can't be utilized because the\nindustry does not use the same type of canisters. But what I am\ntold it is so hot once it is stored and it leaks like a sieve\nbecause the hydrology shows already in exploratory tunnel, it\nleaks like a sieve. That once the canisters are there, titanium\ndrip shields will have to be created to put over the canisters.\nAnd by the way, those titanium drip shields would not be placed\nin that facility once the canisters are here until 90 years\nlater and it cannot be placed by a man in there, so you have to\nbuild robotics to put the titanium drip shields to protect the\nwater that goes down into the canisters that would go into the\naquifer below. Is that the science you are saying that you\nwould learn from that you should not have in any other\nrepository?\nMr. Nesbit. What I was referring to, Senator, was\ncompleting the licensing process and having the concerns, such\nas you just expressed, evaluated by a panel of experts and\nruled on in a manner that we can learn from them, if indeed we\ngo on to develop other repositories elsewhere. That's all I'm\ntalking about.\nSenator Cortez Masto. We already have the information, and\nthat is my point.\nMr. Nesbit. Well, Senator, I don't agree with your\nconcerns.\nSenator Cortez Masto. We have spent $19 billion on a five-\nmile exploratory tunnel to study the geology and hydrology. We\nknow that because it is a volcanic tuff and there are fractures\nthrough the rock that it's going to leak. So that is why the\ntitanium drip shields are part of your plan for the canisters\nthat will be placed there.\nThat is what I am saying. We already have the information\nthat shows it is not safe. Why are we going to waste another 30\nyears with 218 contentions by the state and lawsuits that I\nknow I was part of as Attorney General, against your\ndepartment, or excuse me, against the Department of Energy,\ninstead of looking forward in a comprehensive approach and\nutilizing the science to help us understand in moving forward\non the new technology that is out there. That is all I am\nlooking for, and I would love for the industry to come to the\ntable and work with us on that.\nThank you.\nMr. Nesbit. The key question at Yucca Mountain is not\nwhether it's built in volcanic tuff, but whether it can or\ncannot comply with the very conservative environmental\nstandards that were laid down to protect the health and safety\nof the public. And that's the question that would be resolved\nin a licensing hearing before fair, impartial and qualified\njudges.\nSenator Cortez Masto. I disagree.\nBut now that I have more time, let me add a little bit more\nto this because I think for purposes of science, we really are,\nand I would ask the scientists here, isn't the intent here to\ndecrease any type of unexpected opportunities with respect to\nscience?\nYou want a place that is safe, that you are going to\ndecrease any vulnerabilities with respect to that deep geologic\nsite instead of adding to those vulnerabilities by man-made,\nalleged safety barriers or natural safety barriers. You are\ngoing to decrease those kind of vulnerabilities. And isn't that\nwhat you're really looking for, for any type of site, a deep\ngeologic site?\nAnd maybe, Mr. Fettus, I don't know if you have a response\nto that?\nMr. Fettus. I couldn't agree more, Senator Cortez Masto.\nThe idea behind any geologic repository is to find geologic\nmedia that can isolate the waste for the length of time it's\ndangerous. And the problem that the Yucca Mountain project has\nrepeatedly run into is whenever it ran into the technical\nchallenges that you so accurately describe, the response was to\nweaken the standards to allow the site to be licensed. So we\ndon't look at that upcoming atomic safety and licensing board\nproceeding, if it were to ever go forward, as a full exercise\nin having the state have a fair say.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you.\nMs. Korsnick. If I could just add, since we were talking\nabout drip shields, we do know that EPRI did an analysis back\nin 2008 and they found that the repository was capable of\nmeeting the regulatory requirements without the drip shields,\nthat they had sufficient defense in depth. The drip shields\nwere designed simply as an additional redundant layer of\nprotection. I just wanted to make sure that that was clear.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Right, but still the drip shields are\nthere as a redundant layer and that is the point. And you are\nsupposed to be reducing those types of additional redundancies,\naren't you, as supposedly having the natural redundancies there\nand then adding them as necessary.\nAgain, I am all for moving forward. I think we have to have\na solution here, and I think we have to be smart about it.\nThis is waste that is going to be there for millions of\nyears, for generations to come for our children and our\ngrandchildren, and we have to do right by them. We have to be\ncoming together, particularly in this country, to address this\nissue.\nThank you, Madam Chair.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator.\nAnd to our panel, we appreciate your contribution this\nmorning. We all acknowledge that we have an issue that has been\na longstanding issue that has not been resolved and our effort\nwill be to defy the skeptics and to change the status quo\nwhich, quite honestly, has been going on for far too long.\nI do not want Senator Risch to be sitting here in this\nCommittee five years from now in a similar hearing and saying,\nI remember back in 2019 we were talking about it and it was the\nsame as it was when I first came to the Committee.\nWe have an obligation. We have good folks working on\nthings.

Michael Crapo, Chairman of the\nCommittee, presiding.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN MIKE CRAPO\nChairman Crapo. The hearing will come to order.\nToday we are joined by three witnesses who have evaluated\nand written extensively on the Terrorism Risk Insurance\nProgram, including Mr. Tarique Nageer, Terrorism Placement and\nAdvisory Leader with Marsh; Dr. Howard Kunreuther, the Co-\nDirector of the Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes\nCenter; and Mr. Baird Webel, Specialist in Financial Economics\nwith the Congressional Research Service.\nThe terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, devastated\nU.S. citizens, households, and businesses. In the wake of those\nattacks, Congress passed and the President signed into law the\nTerrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 to establish the Terrorism\nRisk Insurance Program, or TRIP, and to stabilize the market\nfor terrorism risk insurance.\nSince then, Congress has reauthorized the program three\ndifferent times in 2005, 2007, and 2015.\nMy goal in each reauthorization was to build on existing\ndata to find ways for the private insurance industry to absorb\nand cover the losses for all but the largest acts of terror,\nones in which the Federal Government would likely be forced to\nstep in were the program not there.\nCongress made several improvements to the program during\nthe 2015 reauthorization. First, it increased the program\ntrigger from $100 million to $200 million in increments of $20\nmillion each year. Second, it increased aggregate retention\namount of $2 billion each year eventually to an amount that\nwill be based on average insurer deductibles; and third, it\ndecreased the coinsurance rate from 85 percent to 80 percent in\n1 percent increments each year.\nThat bill garnered overwhelming bipartisan support in the\nSenate with a vote of 93 to 4.\nThe Program is once again set to expire on December 31,\n2020. Well ahead of that expiration date, the Banking Committee\nhas already started meeting with key stakeholders and is\nexploring whether there are additional balanced reforms to\nimprove the program and reduce taxpayer exposure without having\na material negative effect on the cost and take-up rates for\nterrorism coverage.\nIn 2018, the Treasury Department issued a report on the\nprogram's effectiveness, which also discussed key developments\nin the marketplace for terrorism risk insurance.\nIn addition to Treasury concluding in the report that the\nprogram has accomplished its principle goals identified in\nTRIA, Treasury also observed that private reinsurance of\nterrorism risk has significantly increased under the program,\nand there is now increased private reinsurance capacity for the\nexposures that remain wholly with the private market under\nTRIP.\nEach of today's witnesses have written extensively on the\nprogram's effectiveness, structure, and market developments.\nIn 2018, Dr. Kunreuther coauthored a report on the program,\nwhich found that, overall, TRIA has worked well. It has\nstabilized a very disrupted market in the aftermath of 2001,\nmaking terrorism insurance widely available and affordable.\nTake-up rates among enterprises, small and large, are rather\nhigh, and premiums, a few percentage points of what firms pay\nfor their property insurance, even though cost and take-up\nrates vary widely by size, industry, geography, and line of\nbusiness.\nIn its 2019 Terrorism Risk Insurance Report, Marsh\ndiscussed take-up rates as well as cost, geographic, and\ncorporate trends in terrorism risk insurance in the United\nStates as well as globally.\nMarsh emphasized in the report that the Federal backstop\ncreated by TRIA and reauthorized as TRIPRA, along with similar\npublic-private mechanisms that exist in other countries,\nremains crucial to the continued stability and health of the\nproperty terrorism insurance market.\nFinally, the Congressional Research Service has published\nnumerous reports, including one as recently as April 2019,\nproviding a comprehensive overview of the program, its history,\nstatutory changes in past reauthorizations, and key\nconsiderations for this Congress.\nDuring this hearing, I look forward to hearing more about\nspecific considerations in evaluating the program's\neffectiveness, how the program has evolved over time, how the\nmarketplace has responded to changes to the program made by\nCongress in previous reauthorizations, what additional room\nexists to further reduce taxpayer exposure, and how market\nparticipants may react to changes in different program levers.\nAgain, I thank each of the witnesses for joining us today\nto share your perspectives and your research.\nSenator Brown.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR SHERROD BROWN\nSenator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding the\nCommittee's first hearing on the reauthorization of the\nTerrorism Risk Insurance Program. It expires the end of next\nyear, after the lapse at the end of 2014. We all understand we\nneed to start early enough to make sure it does not happen\nagain.\nTRIA is critical to keeping our economy healthy. It is not\njust a program that helps in the event of a terrorist attack.\nBusinesses rely on this insurance in order to get access to\ncredit, even in healthy economic times. Without Government\nassistance, the insurance market would be unable to provide\naffordable insurance to these businesses, including small\nbusinesses, across our country.\nWhile TRIA was initially designed to be temporary after 9/\n11, both parties have agreed several times since then that\nthere is value in keeping it. People may hear the word\n``terrorism'' and think this does not apply to their community,\nthat only businesses in places like New York and Washington or\nbig national landmarks would need to worry about insuring\nagainst terrorism.\nBut, unfortunately, terrorism is not confined to big\ncities, and the groups perpetrating it do not only come from\nabroad. Ohio communities that have faced threats from white\nsupremacist groups know all too well this is a risk we all\ncontend with.\nThat is why I am glad we have been able to work on it in a\nbipartisan way. We agree there are some issues that the free\nmarket just cannot solve on its own. This is one of them. It is\nan example of the kind of successful Government intervention\nthat is only possible when we come together as a country.\nSome in Congress would prefer the United States not make\nthese kind of guarantees, whether it is for worker pensions,\nwhether it is for Social Security, whether it is for mortgages\nand affordable housing or for health care or food for low-\nincome families, or this issue for protections against economic\ndestruction after terrorist attacks. Some politicians just are\nnot interested in coming together on behalf of Americans that\nlive in Mansfield or Cleveland or Boise or Idaho Falls.\nI disagree and think the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program\nis emblematic of our ability to use Government to make the\neconomy work better for everybody, especially during difficult\ntimes. As we look at other issues on this Committee, I hope we\nwill remember the success of this program and our capacity to\nuse Government to solve tough problems when we decide that is\nwhat we want to do.\nIn the last bipartisan authorization of TRIA, we worked to\nstrike a balance, which seems to work well. By increasing the\nprogram trigger to $200 million, by gradually reducing the\nGovernment's share in the losses, we have made the program\nefficient without decreasing access to coverage. We have an\nopportunity to make the program even stronger by creating\ncertainty in the marketplace through a long-term extension of\nthe program, and I emphasize long term. I hope we can work\ntogether to do that.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you, Senator Brown.\nWe will now proceed to our witnesses, and I will ask you to\nplease give your oral remarks in the order I introduced you and\nagain ask you to remember to watch that clock so that we can\nstay to your 5 minutes allocated and get to the Senators'\nquestions.\nWith that, Mr. Nageer.\nSTATEMENT OF TARIQUE NAGEER, TERRORISM PLACEMENT AND ADVISORY\nLEADER, MARSH\nMr. Nageer. Good morning, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member\nBrown, and Members of the Committee. My name is Tarique Nageer,\nand I am the Terrorism Placement Leader at Marsh. I do\nappreciate the opportunity to speak with you today about this\ntopic.\nFor our company, like many others, the impact of terrorism\nis deeply personal. Marsh & McLennan lost 295 colleagues and\nscores of business associates on 9/11.\nAs a leading risk advisor in the insurance market, Marsh &\nMcLennan has a unique perspective on the Terrorism Risk\nInsurance Program.\nTerrorism remains an evolving, expanding, and ever present\nrisk, which underlies the importance of this program and\nensuring the continued stability and health of the property and\ncasualty terrorism insurance market.\nWe have seen a decline in both the frequency and severity\nof terrorist incidents in the United States over the last\nseveral years, and there have been no certified terrorism\nlosses in the United States since TRIA was originally passed in\n2002, but we cannot afford to be complacent. The Federal\nbackstop created by TRIA restored insurance capacity during the\ncritical post-9/11 period.\nWe at Marsh strongly support its reauthorization and\nmodernization, including enhancing the existing public-private\npartnership.\nToday my testimony will include four main areas. First,\nfindings from the Marsh's 2019 Terrorism Risk Ins Report once\nagain highlighted that terrorism risk is not only a big-\nbusiness or big-city issue. Education entities with the most\nfrequent buyers of terrorism insurance in 2018, while companies\nin hospitality, gaming, health care, life sciences, and\nnonprofits all landed in the top 10 of buyers. These\norganizations can be found anywhere, from small college towns\nto urban city centers.\nThe uptake for TRIA coverage and property policies averaged\n62 percent in 2018. Clearly, a wide array of industries depend\non the program to thrive and protect their workforce as they\ncontinue to purchase terrorism coverage at a high rate.\nSecond, I would like to provide an overview of the current\nstate of the terrorism insurance market. While there have been\nno significant insured losses in recent years and the industry\nis well capitalized, the access to terrorism insurance is still\ndependent on insurer's preference, appetite, and aggregate\nconstraints. There is a strong possibility that if the Federal\nbackstop ceases to exist, we could see a dominant effect of\nincreased pricing across multiple insurance lines, not just\nterrorism, with a likely result of a major marketplace\ndisruption.\nThird, I will speak about how TRIA plays an integral role\nin the availability and affordability of workers' compensation\ninsurance. The impact of TRIA on the workers' compensation\nmarket makes clear that as long as the Federal backstop remains\nin place, there should be adequate capacity for workers'\ncompensation terrorism coverage. Because of its State-regulated\nnature, workers' compensation policies cannot limit or exclude\ncoverage for perils such as terrorism or nuclear, biological,\nchemical, or radiological, commonly known as NBCR.\nNBCR events can lead to very large human life and economic\nlosses, but coverage is not typically included in reinsurance\ncontracts.\nIn 2014, the uncertainty around TRIA led some insurers to\nstep back from insuring industries with high employee\nconcentrations in certain cities. As insurers began to review\npolicies extending beyond 2020, their willingness to insure\nrisks in high-profile areas will likely decrease again, thus,\nleaving large populations of employees vulnerable.\nFinally, we are already seeing an impact on policies that\nextend beyond 2020, with some insurers either seemingly\nunwilling to offer terrorism coverage beyond the expiration of\nTRIPRA or increase in prices to cover the additional risks to\ntheir portfolios.\nWithout a decision to reauthorize or extend, we expect to\nsee sunset provisions on policies and higher costs as we move\ncloser to December 31, 2020.\nIn Marsh's view, this legislation is a model public-private\npartnership that is instrumental in maintaining a vibrant\nmarketplace by allowing insurers to provide adequate limits of\nterrorism insurance to the business community at affordable\nprices. A seamless\nrenewal process with a robust reauthorization will keep the\nmarketplace sustainable.\nWe encourage decisions to be made with a full understanding\nof the shifts and the nature of terrorism and how they can\naffect organizations and insureds alike.\nFinally, thank you again to the Committee for holding this\nhearing 18 months in advance of the program's scheduled\nexpiration. Time is of the essence, and I look forward to your\nquestions.\nThank you.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you.\nDr. Kunreuther.\nSTATEMENT OF HOWARD KUNREUTHER, Ph.D., PROFESSOR OF DECISION\nSCIENCES AND PUBLIC POLICY AND\nCO-DIRECTOR OF THE WHARTON RISK MANAGEMENT AND DECISION\nPROCESSES CENTER, THE WHARTON SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF\nPENNSYLVANIA\nMr. Kunreuther. Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and\nMembers of the Committee, I very much appreciate the\nopportunity of testifying on the reauthorization of the\nTerrorism Risk Insurance Program. My name is Howard Kunreuther.\nI am the James G. Dinan Professor of Decision Sciences and\nPublic Policy at the Wharton School, University of\nPennsylvania, and Co-Director of the Wharton Risk Management\nand Decision Processes Center.\nThe Center was founded in 1985, with a mission to examine\nalternative strategies for dealing with low-probability, high-\nconsequence events, based on an understanding of the decision\nprocesses of individuals, firms, and public-sector agencies.\nAs Chairman Crapo pointed out, we have produced several\nstudies on the 2015 renewal of TRIA undertaken in consultation\nwith key interested parties from the public and private sectors\nand other academic research institutions that are cited in my\nwritten testimony.\nGiven the limited time that I have available and the\ncomments that Chairman Crapo has made and Representative Brown\nas well as my colleague here, Mr. Nageer, I want to focus on\nreally a following question that was alluded to by Chairman\nCrapo: What modifications to the current public-private\npartnerships should be considered in the renewal of TRIA?\nIn developing these proposals, it is useful, in our\nopinion--and I will speak for a number of us at the Wharton\nRisk Center--to focus on the individual decision processes and\nour systematic biases that have been well documented by\npsychologists and behavioral economists, are discussed in our\nbook ``The Ostrich Paradox: Why We Underprepare for\nDisasters,'' written with my Co-Director, Robert Meyer.\nLet me highlight five of these biases and indicate where\nthey could be used and addressed with respect to the renewal of\nTRIA: first, myopia, the tendency to focus on short-time\nhorizons when appraising immediate costs and the potential\nbenefits of protective investments; amnesia, the tendency to\nforget too quickly the lessons of past disasters; optimism, the\ntendency to underestimate the likelihood that losses will occur\nfrom future hazards; simplification, the tendency to\nselectively attend to only a subset of relevant facts when\nmaking choices involving risk; and finally, herding, the\ntendency to base our choices on the observed actions of others\nwho may not know a great deal more than we know ourselves in\ndealing with these low-probability events.\nI will focus on four areas very briefly in the remaining\ntime to highlight how they may play a role.\nFirst, incentivizing cost-effective mitigation measures by\nfirms, something that TRIA does not do today. To overcome the\nmyopia bias, one could consider long-term mitigation loans, the\nway FEMA has done with respect to the flood problem, and at the\nsame time have insurers offer premium discounts if the claims\nare going to be lower by firms investing in these mitigation\nmeasures.\nSecond, Federal protection against catastrophic losses.\nNow, in our view, in my view, it is important that the Federal\nGovernment cover NBCR, losses from future terrorist attacks,\ngiven the potential catastrophic losses and recoup their\nexpenditures under TRIA. Currently, it is ambiguous as to\nexactly what will happen, although they have the intent to do\nthat.\nNow, the point I want to make here is Congress and the\nstakeholders should not exhibit an optimism bias or an amnesia\nbias by feeling it will not happen to the United States because\nit has not occurred to day.\nThird, behavior of insurers and Congress after a terrorist\nattack. Will premiums significantly increase and future\ncoverage decrease by insurers who might exhibit the\nsimplification bias and focus on worst-case scenarios rather\nthan thinking about likelihood as well? What will Congress do\nif insurers significantly raise their premium so that many\ncommercial firms feel they cannot afford to purchase insurance\nprotection?\nOn that basis, there is a suggestion that insurers consider\na multi-year policy, a 2- or 3-year policy, so they keep this\nfor more than just the 1 year and for that reason actually are\nin a position to deal with this afterwards.\nFinally, dealing with interdependencies. There are a lot of\nevents, like cyber, that are interdependent and have, can cause\npotentially catastrophic losses. Treasury and the private\ninsurers should integrate and interact with each other on that\nissue.\nSo, in conclusion, Congress and other key stakeholders\nshould examine how countries cope with terrorism risk to\ndetermine whether these approaches merit consideration for the\nUnited States.\nAnd on that note, let me conclude my comments here and look\nforward to a dialogue with you afterwards.\nThank you.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you.\nMr. Webel.\nSTATEMENT OF BAIRD WEBEL, SPECIALIST IN FINANCIAL ECONOMICS,\nCONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE\nMr. Webel. Thank you.\nMr. Chairman, Ranking Member, Members of the Committee,\nthank you for the opportunity to testify today. My name is\nBaird Webel. I am a Specialist in Financial Economics at the\nCongressional Research Service.\nAs a note for members of the audience who may not be\nfamiliar with the CRS, we are a division of the Library of\nCongress. Our role is to provide objective, nonpartisan\nresearch and analysis. CRS takes no position on the\ndesirability of any specific policy nor advocates for any\nspecific policy outcome.\nI have been at CRS at this role since 2003, so I have seen\nthe reauthorizations of TRIA since, and I would like to talk\nabout three broad things that Congress has faced as we have\ndone reauthorization in the past.\nThe first question that it faced is, basically, is a\nFederal terrorism program needed? TRIA was passed a little more\nthan a year after the terrorist attacks in September 11, 2001.\nIt was passed as a specifically temporary 3-year program, and\nby temporary, I do not mean that there was an expiration date,\njust an expiration date of 2005. The statute itself in two\nplaces says this is a temporary program.\nAs the end of previous reauthorizations have come up,\nCongress has successively seen the need to reauthorize the\nprogram to give the private market additional time to face the\nthreat of terrorism losses, and I think a significant point in\nthis is the difficulty in estimating terrorist events going\nforward and the losses from these events. The industry has been\nlargely successful at rebuilding capital, but making estimates\nof future terrorism losses remains exceedingly difficult.\nWhat Congress has done in the TRIA reauthorizations is\nbasically affect the second aspect that I would talk about,\nnamely how private insurers should share in funding terrorism\nrisk with the Federal Government.\nThere are basically three different levers in the program\nthat have been used in this sense. There is a deductible, and\nessentially, it is a two-stage deductible.\nThere is a program trigger, which is an aggregate amount of\nlosses that the entire industry will incur before Federal\nfunding occurs.\nThere is an individual insurer deductible which is set\nessentially based on the written premium for each insurer, a\nrough proximate size of its exposure to the terrorism market\nthat must be cleared before Federal funding occurs.\nAnd then after this, after these deductibles, there is an\ninsured loss share compensation, and this is essentially a\ncopay. So that once you clear the deductibles, there is a\nvarying amount--there has been a varying amount of the share\nthat the Government will cover.\nFinally, there are terrorism loss spreading premiums. These\nare somewhat unusual in the insurance world in the sense that\nwhen we all purchase homeowners insurance or auto insurance, we\npay our premiums upfront. In this case, the premiums are set to\nbe after the fact, and so that depending on the exact loss\nlevels, there will be a premium placed on insurance policies\ngoing forward to recoup the amount for the Government.\nAll of these over the life of TRIA have been adjusted in\nvarious ways to increase the private-sector exposure to\nterrorism risk.\nAnd the third broad aspect that I would talk about is, What\nexactly should a Federal terrorism insurance program cover?\nRight now, TRIA basically works through the private\ninsurance market. Private insurance policies that are covered\nunder the lines that are specified in TRIA--the private\ninsurers are required to make terrorism coverage available\nunder essentially the same terms and conditions for other types\nof insurance. So if you are going to cover loss from a fire,\nfor example, from an accident, the insurer has to offer\ncoverage for a fire due to loss from terrorism, but the\ninsureds are not required to purchase this policy.\nAnd the terms and conditions that apply to this are the\nsame--it is the same for an accidental cause as it is for a\nterrorist cause, and this becomes particularly important in the\nrealm of nuclear, chemical, biological, radiological, because\nmost private insurance policies will exclude NCBR events,\nregardless of the source. So if a policy excludes a chemical\nspill from an accident from a train, it will exclude a chemical\nspill caused by a terrorist attack, and I think this is\nparticularly significant because those are the terrorist\nattacks that could cause the most damage. And I am not certain\nthat people realize to what degree these NCBR events would not\nbe covered.\nSo, with the end of the 5 minutes, I will be happy to take\nany future questions.\nThank you.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you, Mr. Webel, and I appreciate each\nof you. You all stayed within your 5 minutes. I appreciate\nthat.\nMr. Webel, I will start with you. It is very important to\nme that the two major objectives will be achieved. One is that\nTRIA continually benefit and stabilize the marketplace, and the\nother is that we minimize taxpayer exposure.\nWhat factors do you look at to indicate whether TRIA has\nbeen effective and to measure its potential future success in\nachieving these objectives?\nMr. Webel. I think that the take-up rate for terrorism\npolicies is really important because you can see, for example,\nin the flood insurance program that you get flood disasters\nwhere a lot of people have not purchased flood insurance\npolicies. And it is not going to help to have an insurance-\nproviding program if you do not have the people purchasing the\npolicies.\nI think as well, any aspects that you can have of overall\nprivate reinsurance capacity, the amount of private insurance\nthat it offered outside of TRIA is a really important marker of\nhow well the private market is responding and developing\ncapacity to deal with terrorism.\nChairman Crapo. All right. Thank you.\nI am going to move to you--is it ``Nageer'' or ``Nagger''?\nMr. Nageer. Nageer.\nChairman Crapo. OK. Nageer.\nIn terms of the objective of assuring that we achieve the\nbest possible protection of hitting a taxpayer bailout or a\ntaxpayer cost here, we need to understand how changes that we\nmake to the program can have an impact on both small and large\nparticipants, some insurers themselves.\nSo I guess the question I am asking is, Can you provide an\nindication of how smaller and larger insurers may be affected\nby changes in the coinsurance rate and the program trigger,\nrespectively, based on our historical evidence?\nMr. Nageer. Thank you for the question, Chairman Crapo.\nAs you know that in your original opening statement, there\nhave been a few levers that have been adjusted during the\ncourse of the lifecycle of TRIPRA currently, and the insurers\nwith adequate notice have been able to adjust to these\nincremental changes, either to the increased trigger levels or\nthe increased coinsurance between a loss being shared between\nthe Government as well as the private marketplace.\nSo in terms of having the ability and the capacity in the\nmarketplace to be able to respond and take up increases in\nthese different levers, the capacity does exist because there\nis adequate capital within the insurance and reinsurance market\nbase for these types of incremental changes, but I stress the\nword ``incremental,'' and I stress the word also with some good\nnotice as well. So you have got to give them some time to sort\nof prep for these changes and make it incremental so they can\nadjust their buying of reinsurance for example, or being able\nto plan ahead and structure their--the book of business that\nthey underwrite properly.\nIn terms of policyholders and insurers, who could be\nimpacted by this, the very large insurers, one of the triggers\nunder TRIPRA is the 20 percent insurer deductible, and how that\nworks is 20 percent of the insurer's prior year's direct TRIPRA\npremium is retained by them for any one loss, before the\nGovernment co-shares the risk, the loss with them.\nSo for the very larger insurers, 20 percent is a big\nnumber, but my colleagues at Guy Carpenter have measured the\npolicyholder surplus of insurers with less than $500 million of\npolicyholder surplus, which is basically reserves. And there\nare about 662 insurers who fall within that category.\nAnd a subset of that 662 is about 240 insurers who fall\nbetween the $100 million and $500 million of policyholder\nsurplus, and those are the insurers who could be more directly\nimpacted negatively with abrupt increases in the trigger\nlevels. And the trigger in 2020 is going to be $200 million. So\nif you increased that gradually over time, yes, they could\nadjust for that, but that bucket of insurers within that $1 to\n$500 million policyholder surplus range are the ones who will\nbe more impacted.\nChairman Crapo. All right. Thank you.\nDr. Kunreuther, you in your testimony, I think, endorsed a\nnotion of incentivizing mitigation, something which you\nindicated is not currently in TRIA; is that correct?\nMr. Kunreuther. That is correct.\nChairman Crapo. Could you describe that in a little more\ndetail what you are talking about there?\nMr. Kunreuther. I would be happy to.\nI think the reason that I think mitigation is not included,\nnumber one, is it is always a challenge to get measures, but I\nthink there is work that has been done.\nI will highlight just at least the fact that Pool Re in the\nUnited Kingdom have actually had a number of ideas in terms and\nthoughts that they are working closely with the U.K. government\nto incentivize firms to actually invest in mitigation.\nThe basic idea in terms of what we are proposing here is\nthat if you can spread the cost of the mitigation measure over\ntime, you will have a much better chance of getting a\nsuccessful investment in these measures because of the fact\nthat people will not say--firms will not say or consumers will\nnot say, which is the case certainly in the flood area, that\n``This is too costly for us. It is going to affect our bottom\nline tomorrow.''\nAnd when you have the opportunity of actually spreading\nthis with loans that could be made--and that has been done by\nFEMA, Federal Emergency Management Agency, for flood--it could\nbe done by banks and financial institutions, but it could be\nalso done by Treasury or by a Government agency to encourage\nthose investments. You then have the opportunity of actually\nmaking this attractive in the short run because insurers\nhopefully would then--actually reduce their premiums because\nthe claims that they are going to have to face would be lower\nthan they would be before, and the actual premium reduction\nwould be greater than the cost of the loan each year. So it\nwould be viewed attractive financially for firms to want to do\nthat, and this has been shown with consumers in investing in\nmitigation measures against natural hazards that they will want\nto do that.\nAnd that is the reason why we are suggesting it, to\novercome a myopia bias.\nChairman Crapo. All right. Well, thank you. That is very\ninteresting. I appreciate that.\nSenator Brown.\nSenator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nMr. Webel, I would like to start with you. Since the last\nreauthorization, there have been a number of tragic white\nsupremacist attacks on synagogues and other places of worship\nin California, Florida, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania,\nSouth Carolina, and Texas. No amount, of course, of insurance\nmoney can make up for the lives lost and families torn apart.\nRecently, the Jewish Federation of Cleveland has raised an\nissue about protecting thousands of people whom they serve each\nweek. As religiously affiliated nonprofit organizations try to\ntake action to protect their communities, they often find that\ninsurance for these kinds of threats is hard to come by and\nvery, very expensive. TRIA was implemented to make sure this\nkind of insurance was available.\nMy question is this: Do you think this situation, safety at\nhouses of worship and other religious institutions, which we\nhave been the target of threats and attacks, that that is the\nkind of problem TRIA was designed to address?\nMr. Webel. TRIA is designed to address terrorism, and it is\na broad swath. It does not specify.\nIn one of the previous reauthorizations, they removed the\nrequirement for it to be a foreign act of terrorism. So it does\nnot make any distinction between the different types of\nterrorism. It just is terrorism as certified by the Secretary\nof the Treasury.\nSenator Brown. If insurance is available but priced so high\nthat it is unaffordable, does that meet the spirit of Congress'\nintent?\nMr. Webel. The law is basically silent on that. It has a\n``make available'' provision, but it does not include\nspecifications on what that premium is supposed to cost.\nSenator Brown. Is not it sort of intuitive that if you\ncannot afford it, you really do not have access to it?\nMr. Webel. This is certainly an issue, and basically,\nimplicitly what the law provides is there are specifications in\nState insurance law that premiums are not supposed to be\nexcessive and so essentially above the cost of the risk.\nSo the TRIA essentially defaults to the State regulation of\ninsurance. It does not do it directly from the Federal level.\nSenator Brown. So if congressional intent is all terrorism,\nas you suggest, and it is not affordable because State\nregulators have not given the priority to make it accessible\nand affordable, then perhaps it is our obligation on this\nCommittee and in the House and Senate to pressure our State\nregulators to make it affordable?\nMr. Webel. That would be the lever that TRIA provides, yes,\nessentially.\nSenator Brown. Treasury used its discretion under the law\nto issue guidance clarifying TRIA's applicability to cyber-\nrelated risk. Do you think Treasury has the authority to make\nsure religious-affiliated institutions have real access to the\nTerrorism Risk Insurance Program?\nMr. Webel. I do not see under the statute, as currently\ndesigned, where Treasury would have a direct lever to do that.\nSenator Brown. Should it?\nMr. Webel. That is up to Congress.\nSenator Brown. Mr. Nageer, let me go through. Do you want\nto respond to that?\nMr. Nageer. If I could, if you do not mind. So, just to\nadd, the terrorism marketplace as we see it is quite\ncompetitive. There are lots of insurers, both on the property\nside, casualty side, and the terrorism side who have capacity\nto offer terrorism insurance for all ranges of motives, be it\nwhat you were just describing or what is conventionally known\nas acts of terrorism. So there is enough capacity within the\nmarketplace, and I think to be able to--and TRIA served--in its\ninitial creation of TRIA served to help create that vibrant\nmarketplace.\nSenator Brown. Well, there is competition in the healthcare\nmarketplace too, but to argue that it is always accessible----\nMr. Nageer. Right.\nSenator Brown.----is another question. OK. Thank you for\nthat.\nLet me ask the three of you and start with you, Mr. Nageer.\nI have a couple questions. As we look to move on a\nreauthorization bill, should we make the extension for a longer\nperiod, and how long should it actually be, Mr. Nageer?\nIf each of you would give me a brief answer on that.\nMr. Nageer. The last reauthorization was for 5 years.\nBefore that, it was for 7 years. The 7 years worked quite well.\nSo I think anywhere between 7 to 10 years would be a good\noutcome. It would allow the marketplace to adapt and grow,\nbuild capital, and be able to take on more of a trigger or a\ncoinsurance mechanism, however you want to----\nSenator Brown. I like the way you negotiate. You say the\nlast was 5, the one before was 7.\nMr. Nageer. Correct.\nSenator Brown. So we should make it 7 to 10. I like that.\nYes, go ahead. Your answer too. Do you want to answer too?\nMr. Kunreuther. I would be happy to.\nI think a longer period is always desirable, but I think\nthere are tradeoffs in doing that because when you have a\nlonger period, the question is, are there going to be changes\nor things that would require one to review this and whatnot? So\nto the extent that there are opportunities at least to have\nstudies done that would enable one to somehow say on the basis\nof possible changes, one would want to deal with this in a\ndifferent way, I think cyber is a very good example of that, by\nthe way, because there are some real challenges as to how one\nis going to deal with cyber. And that would not have been\nnecessarily true 5 or 10 years ago.\nSo I think I would favor, in general, a longer period of\ntime. How long, I think is something that Congress and the\nstakeholders would have to discuss, because it gives people and\ngives firms the opportunity to plan more extensively than\nknowing that somehow things might be changed. And so I would\nmove in that direction.\nThere is a saying--and I think TRIA exhibits it in a very\ngood way--that nothing is more permanent than the temporary,\nand so, in some sense, what was viewed as a temporary has\nbecome more permanent for very good reason. So that is one of\nthe reasons why we support the renewal very strongly.\nSenator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Kunreuther.\nMr. Webel?\nMr. Webel. We obviously do not have a position on the\nlength.\nI do think purely from the private-sector perspective,\ninsurers certainly would be able to deal better with things the\nlonger that it is, but I do think there is a very legitimate\npublic policy perspective that Dr. Kunreuther said of taking a\nlook at things more often to make sure that it is working.\nSenator Brown. Thank you.\nChairman Crapo. Senator Tillis.\nSenator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nGentlemen, thank you for being here.\nMr. Webel, I will not ask you this question because I know\nthe answer. It has to do with supporting the reauthorization.\nBoth of you all feel like we should reauthorize it, although,\nProfessor Kunreuther, you have made some comments that I wanted\nto drill down on, and it really has to do--and I think, Mr.\nNageer, you commented that the losses have been relatively low.\nSo how instructive are the current incidences to any sort\nof downward trend on risk premiums right now? I mean, are we\nseeing a downward trend based on the losses, or how do they\nproject out actuarially and determine how much they actually\nhave to collect to provide insurance at a reasonable price?\nMr. Nageer. In terms of the marketplace, yes, it is a bit\nof a downward trend for this because the insurers, like I said,\nhave all capitalized, and they have not had to pay major claims\nrecently, right?\nSenator Tillis. Yeah.\nDr. Kunreuther, if we were going to look at--first, I do\nnot believe we should have a permanent reauthorization because\nI do believe the world changes. The nature of the threats\nchange, and it is Congress' role to update and reauthorize\nthese programs.\nI do think that we should have a discussion about what a\nreasonable planning horizon is so that we can optimize the\nproducts that the private sector can offer.\nBut if you take a look at the recoupment, the current\nrecoupment policies, really the pyramid of how this program\ncomes together, do you have any insights into specific areas\nthat we should look at for any sort of modernization or\nreforms?\nMr. Kunreuther. Thank you for the question, Senator Tillis.\nI think that one of the challenges with respect to\nterrorism and events that are very, very hard to estimate the\nrisk is that when you have a recoupment, you are not pushing\nfor a premium to be set on these very catastrophic losses that\nthe Government would cover. And I think there are some real\nadvantages to that in the sense that you are then saying you\nwill have to pay it back with 140 percent in this particular\ncase. So I would favor that aspect of it.\nI think a real interesting question that needs to be put on\nthe table as a part of the discussion is, What kind of risk\ntransfer mechanisms are available in the form of reinsurance\nand catastrophe bonds, which are being used in other cases?\nSenator Tillis. That was going to be my next question.\nMr. Kunreuther. Oh, OK.\nSenator Tillis. No, that is a good one. Keep going.\nMr. Kunreuther. And how can that play an important role in\nproviding the kind of protection that firms would actually want\nto have, that insurers would want to have in terms of knowing\nthat they can cover it, and the Government might want to have?\nI think Pool Re, as I mentioned earlier, in the United\nKingdom has marketed a cat bond in order to be able to support\nvery unusual losses that they might suffer in the United\nKingdom, and that could be possibly considered by the Federal\nGovernment as well. And I think on that level, you could have a\ncombination of the recoupment as well as these other forms of\nrisk transfer, including private reinsurance.\nSenator Tillis. One of the questions, you brought up the\npoint of mitigation, which has really been a thorn in my side\non flood insurance program because we always talk about it, and\nwe never do anything about it----\nMr. Kunreuther. Challenge.\nSenator Tillis.----in terms of investing and for a lot of\nreasons, cost being one of them.\nBut when you take a look at the nature of the threat,\nreally the nature of the threat as it exists today versus 10\nyears ago, it would seem like there is only so much that we\ncould do with respect to mitigation. Can you enlighten me on\nsome of the concepts that are being discussed now?\nMr. Kunreuther. I think that is an excellent point in terms\nof saying that this is a real challenge with terrorism and on a\ncouple of levels. That might not be the case with flood, where\nyou can mitigate. You can elevate a structure.\nSenator Tillis. You know when the water is going to rise,\nand you can model that.\nMr. Kunreuther. Right.\nSenator Tillis. But you cannot necessarily model the next\nattempt to take down a building.\nMr. Kunreuther. I am not an expert at the moment but want\nto be more of an expert in the future. And I can comment that\nin the context of the United Kingdom, there are some\nsuggestions for mitigation that they are now pursuing with the\ngovernment, concrete structures, other ways to actually make\nthese structures safer against terrorist attacks. And they are\ngoing to be working with insurers as well as with the\ngovernment to try to deal with it.\nI think one of the reasons that this is so important is\nbecause we all want to reduce these losses, and to the extent\nthat you can do that, I think it might help.\nSenator Tillis. Well, I think that the more we become\nhardened, the fewer targets a terrorist would have. So I think\nit has a public safety benefit as well. It maybe takes out an\nentire tranche of either domestic or foreign terrorist. So, to\nme, it is a very interesting discussion to have as we move\nforward through the reauthorization to see if there is\nsomething as a matter of public policy that we should incent\nState, local, and private-sector entities to invest in, because\nat the end of the day, I think it could also reduce the Federal\nGovernment's downside risk.\nMr. Kunreuther. If I can make just one very quick point, it\ndoes also address the affordability issue.\nSenator Tillis. Yeah.\nMr. Kunreuther. If you then can have mitigation in place,\npremiums could come down, and some of the comments that were\nraised earlier could----\nSenator Tillis. And ultimately the cost of the mitigation\nitself----\nMr. Kunreuther. Yeah.\nSenator Tillis.----when you have a higher demand for it.\nThank you, Mr. Chair, and I look forward to us moving\nforward and getting the plan maybe modernized, but certainly\nreauthorized.\nMr. Nageer. Senator, if I could add something else to\nHoward.\nSo, as we move from these hardened target, you get more\nbetter protected against those targets. Softer targets appear,\nand what we have been seeing is the act of terrorism impacts\nnot only major cities, but it is also spread across the rest of\nthe country, smaller cities, more softer targets, where a\nperpetrator can actually get in and do some serious damage\nbecause they cannot get into these hardened targets.\nThe interest of terrorism, we see it as being a nationwide\nhard, soft, small-city, big-city issue well across the country.\nSenator Tillis. Thank you.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you.\nSenator Menendez.\nSenator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nAs a general matter, insurance markets in our country are\nprivate, and it is unusual to have any kind of Federal\nbackstop, unless we have a public interest or a breakdown in\nthe private market where a Government role is needed to restore\nfunctionality.\nIn the case of Terrorism Risk Insurance, in my view, we\nhave both. If terrorists attack our Country, the United States\nhas a national interest in minimizing the economic harm they\ninflict, and in terms of market functionality, private actors\nare inherently limited in the things they can do to evaluate\nand reduce their risk in this regard.\nInsurance companies, for example, should not start their\nown intelligence agencies to improve their predictive models,\nand commercial real estate owners should not conduct\ncounterterrorism operations to lower their premiums.\nSo I would like to ask our witnesses, if you can, to\nelaborate on what makes terrorism different from other risks\nand why a Federal backstop is, in fact, needed.\nMr. Kunreuther. I will be happy to start, and my colleagues\nwill chime in.\nI think one of the real challenges with terrorism is that\nit is so very difficult to estimate what the likelihood of a\nterrorist attack will be in the future. We have been very\nfortunate not to have had anything since 9/11, but the fact of\nthe matter is that prior to 9/11, the insurers were not worried\nabout this, and after 9/11, they became very worried, as we all\nknow. And that is one of the reasons why TRIA got passed, and I\nthink it was very important that it did get passed for the\nreasons you were mentioning, Representative Menendez. So I\nappreciate your question.\nI think the fact that catastrophic losses and the potential\nfor catastrophic losses will discover any private insurer from\nactually offering coverage, and TRIA does precisely that. It\nhas the backstop of actually providing the protection, with a\nrecoupment that I think is appropriate afterwards, for dealing\nwith these large losses.\nAnd then the insurers have now found, as Tarique has\nindicated with respect to his comments on the Marsh report,\nthat there are really a number of firms that are now willing to\nbuy coverage and all insurers are forced to offer it.\nSo I think this kind of partnership is the appropriate way.\nThere are changes that we can discuss.\nSenator Menendez. The one thing about terrorism, as someone\nwho offered all of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations into\nlaw when I was in the House of Representatives, is that we do\nnot know what the next form of terrorism is going to be or its\nmagnitude.\nWe never thought that an airplane, something used for\ncivilian travel, would become a weapon of mass destruction.\nWe never thought that maybe cargo coming into a port could\nultimately have a dirty bomb.\nWe never thought that an envelope laced with anthrax could\nbe a deadly weapon.\nSo the iterations of what this is is always beyond even as\nwe think ahead and try to prevent. It is a challenge. So I\nthink it is a very unique one.\nI mean, in order to obtain a real estate or commercial\nloan, banks often generally require clients to obtain terrorism\ncoverage. Without terrorism risk insurance, businesses lose out\non essential financing options, and I think allowing TRIA to\nlapse or injecting uncertainty in the process can have serious\neconomic consequences.\nMr. Nageer, what happened to the commercial lending in real\nestate markets in 2014 when Congress allowed TRIA to expire for\n12 days?\nMr. Nageer. Thank you for the question, Senator Menendez.\nSo before I answer that question, I just want to add one\nthing to the modeling, your question before that.\nTRIA--an act of terrorism is not like an act of nature,\nright? Someone actually has to decide, ``I am going to\nperpetrate this act of terrorism.'' So that is very difficult\nfor insurers to model, that uncertainty, that human element of\nit, and that is one of the issues.\nObviously, we have got a ton of data points on the\nreinsurance side for natural disasters. For catastrophic\nterrorism events, 9/11 is the key data point on the model, and\nit does not help. You cannot be predictable with that. You can\ndetermine the impact of these events, but you cannot predict\nthem. So this is why it is very difficult for insurers to model\nit.\nIn terms of what happened in 2014, the uncertainty, it was\nvery hectic. I was in the insurance market at that time, and\ninsurers on property policies as well as workers' compensation\npolicies, when they were considering policies which were going\nto go past December 31, 2014, started putting sunset provisions\non policies, and a sunset clause is essentially a clause which\nsays we elect--we reserve the right to change policies in terms\nof the limits, the coverages, and the prices for what we are\noffering you for terrorism insurance.\nSo once you got into the window of the TRIPRA potentially\nnot renewing at the end of 2014, we saw a preponderance of\nthese sunset classes on clients buying insurance, starting in\nJanuary 1st of 2013.\nAs you go into the next renewal of 2020, any policy which\nrenews comes into force on January 1, 2020, will expire January\n1, 2021, and those policies have a high possibility of having\nthese sunset clauses being put on it.\nSenator Menendez. Mr. Chairman, a final note.\nI assume that if you are having a financial instrument, a\nloan, a mortgage, whatever, that has multiple years and your\ninsurance is sunsetting within the context of that time period,\nthat is going to make the lending institution far less desirous\nof making that a reality.\nMr. Nageer. Absolutely.\nAnd the lender requirements on construction deals, long-\nterm construction deals, or clients with these lender\nrequirements make it quote onerous because that client then has\nto go purchase insurance in an alternative market, which is\ngoing to be added cost to their construction project or\nwhatever it may be. And that market is available, but maybe not\nto the extent to replace the limit the clients would have\ngotten on TRIA.\nSenator Menendez. Maybe so.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you.\nSenator Reed.\nSenator Reed. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nThank you, gentlemen.\nMr. Webel, could you please briefly describe how nuclear,\nbiological, chemical, radiological terrorism events are treated\nunder TRIA?\nMr. Webel. Sure. Thank you for the question.\nNBCR is treated essentially like any other mode of attack.\nThat is to say, it all works through the private insurance\npolicies.\nWhat is particular about NBCR is most private insurance\npolicies would exclude this damage, regardless of whether it\nwas an accidental event or whether it was a terrorist event,\nand if the private insurance policies exclude it, it is\neffectively excluded under TRIA.\nSo, for example, Senator Menendez just mentioned a dirty\nbomb or an anthrax attack. In reality, if a catastrophic attack\noccurred along those lines, it is entirely possible, if not\nlikely, that TRIA coverage would not actually kick in because\nthe private insurance policies that essentially underlie the\nTRIA coverage would not cover it.\nSenator Reed. In that context, as we reauthorize TRIA, do\nyou have any suggested changes with respect to these NBCR\npolicies?\nMr. Webel. It is difficult because the TRIA mechanism has\nworked really well through the private market and allowing the\nState regulators to do the things that they do, allowing the\nprivate insurance companies to do the things that they do.\nIt would certainly be possible from a generic perspective\nto put aspects of TRIA directly affecting those. In the\noriginal TRIA, there were terrorism exclusions that were\nnullified. So it is certainly within Congress' authority to do\nsomething like that with regard to NBCR.\nIt would also be possible to put more incentives,\nessentially, into it. There have been proposals in the past to\nlower the deductibles, lower the trigger, lower the co-shares\nfor an NBCR event, essentially incentivizing insurers to make\nthe coverage or perhaps a mixture of the two approaches.\nMr. Kunreuther. Could I just make one comment following up\non Mr. Webel's point?\nI think that TRIA always had the intent that if the private\ninsurers were not covering NBCR, then there would be some\ncoverage by the Federal Government, if there was an NBCR loss,\nbut it was sort of ambiguous in the sense that it was not\nreally explicitly stated.\nBut after the passage of TRIPRA in 2015, there was a\ncomment by Treasury that they would be doing that.\nI think if one explicitly had that in the legislation that\nthe Federal Government would cover that, it would avoid any of\nthe uncertainty as to what might happen if there was an NBCR\nattack.\nSenator Reed. Thank you.\nMr. Webel. But I think the question is what the mechanism\nwould be because the mechanism for covering losses all works\nthrough the private insurance policies. It is a reimbursement\nto private insurance companies that have sustained losses. If\nthey are not effectively sustaining losses because of the\nexclusion, how that mechanism would work is very unclear.\nMr. Kunreuther. And the only suggestion that I would make\non that is that there would be a recoupment----\nMr. Webel. Yes.\nMr. Kunreuther.----afterwards with respect to that, and\nthat would be explicitly stated.\nSenator Reed. The environment has obviously changed since\nwe first passed the TRIA Act, Mr. Webel. What things should we\ndo for this changing environment?\nI know, again, my colleague, Senator Menendez, was talking\nabout who would have thought of an envelope with anthrax, et\ncetera. Certainly, in the realm of cyber, who would have\nthought that and name the possible catastrophes? Is there any\nadvice about changes?\nMr. Webel. I think that cyber is the thing that people are\nlooking at as the new threat, and Treasury specifically came\nout in 2016 and said the newly created cyber liability line of\ninsurance would be covered under TRIA.\nSo to the extent the private policies are covering cyber,\nagain, it would do so, but I think that there is certainly the\npossibility of using the TRIA model or incentivizing or\nencouraging the market for cyber by explicitly including it in\nTRIA in some way because I think it is also a little unclear in\nterms of the damages that are being incurred in a cyber attack\nand whether that would meet triggers, whether that would meet\ndeductibles and the like. And that is, I think, a real issue.\nSenator Reed. Well, thank you all, gentlemen, for your\ntestimony. I appreciate it very much.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you, Senator Reed.\nAnd that concludes the questioning for today's hearing.\nFor Senators who wish to submit questions for the record,\nthose questions are due by Tuesday, June 25th.\nTo our witnesses, I suspect you may get a fair number of\nthose because, as you can see, there were a number of other\nhearings and other interruptions today that caused us to not\neven be able to get a quorum for our Executive Session. So I\nthink a lot of the Senators are probably going to submit some\nquestions to you. We ask that as you receive those questions\nthat you respond as promptly as you can.\nAgain, we want to thank you for your expertise and for\nsharing your wisdom as well as your research with us today, and\nthis hearing is adjourned.\n[Whereupon, at 11:33 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]\n[Prepared statements, responses to written questions, and\nadditional material supplied for the record follow:]\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN MIKE CRAPO\nToday, we are joined by three witnesses who have evaluated and\nwritten extensively on the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, including\nMr. Tarique Nageer, Terrorism Placement and Advisory Leader with Marsh;\nDr. Howard Kunreuther, Co-Director of the Wharton Risk Management and\nDecision Processes Center; and Mr. Baird Webel, Specialist in Financial\nEconomics with the Congressional Research Service.\nThe terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, devastated U.S.\ncitizens, households and businesses.\nIn the wake of those attacks, Congress passed and the President\nsigned into law the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 to establish\nthe Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or TRIP, and to stabilize the\nmarket for terrorism risk insurance.\nSince then, Congress has reauthorized the Program three different\ntimes in 2005, 2007, and 2015.\nMy goal in each reauthorization was to build on existing data to\nfind ways for the private insurance industry to absorb and cover the\nlosses for all but the largest acts of terror, ones in which the\nFederal Government would likely be forced to step in were the program\nnot there.\nCongress made several improvements to the Program during the 2015\nreauthorization. It increased the program trigger from $100 million to\n$200 million in increments of $20 million each year; increased the\nlevel below which insurers are subject to mandatory recoupment $2\nbillion each year to what is now a floating amount based on insurers'\ndeductibles; and decreased the coinsurance rate from 85 percent to 80\npercent in 1 percent increments each year.\nThat bill garnered overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate\nwith a vote of 93 to 4.\nThe Program is once again set to expire on December 31, 2020.\nWell ahead of that expiration date, the Banking Committee has\nalready started meeting with key stakeholders and is exploring whether\nthere are additional balanced reforms to improve the Program and reduce\ntaxpayer exposure without having a material negative effect on the cost\nand take-up rates for terrorism coverage.\nIn 2018, the Treasury Department issued a report on the Program's\neffectiveness, which also discussed key developments in the marketplace\nfor terrorism risk insurance.\nIn addition to Treasury concluding in the report that ``The Program\nhas accomplished its principle goals identified in TRIA,'' Treasury\nalso observed that ``Private reinsurance of terrorism risk has\nsignificantly increased under the Program, and there is now increased\nprivate reinsurance capacity for the exposures that remain wholly with\nthe private market under TRIP.''\nEach of today's witnesses has written extensively on the Program's\neffectiveness, structure and market developments.\nIn 2018, Dr. Kunreuther co-authored a report on the Program, which\nfound that ``Overall, TRIA has worked well. It has stabilized a very\ndisrupted market in the aftermath of 2001, making terrorism insurance\nwidely available and affordable. Take-up rates among enterprises small\nand large are rather high and premiums a few percentage points of what\nfirms pay for their property insurance, even though cost and take-up\nrates vary widely by size, industry, geography, and line of business.''\nIn its 2019 Terrorism Risk Insurance Report, Marsh discussed take-\nup rates, as well as cost, geographic and corporate trends in terrorism\nrisk insurance in the United States, as well as globally.\nMarsh emphasized in the report that `` . . . the Federal backstop\ncreated by TRIA and reauthorized as TRIPRA--along with similar public-\nprivate mechanisms that exist in other countries--remains crucial to\nthe continued stability and health of the property terrorism insurance\nmarket.''\nFinally, the Congressional Research Service has published numerous\nreports, including one as recently as April 2019, providing a\ncomprehensive overview of the Program, its history, statutory changes\nin past reauthorizations and key considerations for this Congress.\nDuring this hearing, I look forward to hearing more about: specific\nconsiderations in evaluating the Program's effectiveness; how the\nProgram has evolved over time; how the marketplace has responded to\nchanges to the Program made by Congress in previous reauthorizations;\nwhat additional room exists to further reduce taxpayer exposure; and\nhow different market participants may react to changes in different\nProgram levers.\nThank you all for joining us today to share your perspectives and\nresearch.\n______\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR SHERROD BROWN\nThank you Senator Crapo for holding the Committee's first hearing\non the reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program. While\nthe Program expires at the end of next year, after the lapse at the end\nof 2014 we all understand that we need to start early to make sure that\ndoes not happen again.\nThe Terrorism Risk Insurance Program is critical to keeping our\neconomy healthy. TRIA isn't just a program that helps in the event of a\nterrorist attack. Many businesses rely on this insurance in order to\nget access to credit, even in healthy economic times. Without\nGovernment assistance, the insurance market would be unable to provide\naffordable insurance to these businesses, including small businesses,\nacross the country.\nWhile TRIA was initially designed to be temporary after 9-11,\nRepublicans and Democrats have agreed several times since then that\nthere is value in keeping it. People may hear the word ``terrorism''\nand think this doesn't apply to their community, that only businesses\nin places like New York and Washington or big national landmarks would\nneed to worry about insuring against terrorism.\nBut unfortunately, terrorism isn't confined to big cities and the\ngroups perpetrating it don't only come from abroad. Ohio communities\nthat have faced threats from white supremacists groups know all too\nwell that this is a risk we all have to contend with.\nThat's why I'm glad we've been able to work on it in a bipartisan\nway. We all agree there are some issues that the free market just can't\nsolve on its own. This is one of them, and it's an example of the kind\nof successful Government intervention that is only possible when we\ncome together as a country.\nThere are some in Congress who would prefer the United States not\nmake these kinds of guarantees--whether it's for workers' pensions and\nSocial Security, for mortgages and affordable housing, for healthcare\nand food for low-income families, or for protections against economic\ndestruction after terrorist attacks. Some politicians just aren't\ninterested in coming together on behalf of Americans that live in\nMansfield or Cleveland or Chillicothe in Ohio, or in Boise or Idaho\nFalls from the Chairman's State.\nI disagree, and I think the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program is\nemblematic of our ability to use Government to make the economy work\nbetter for everybody, especially during the most difficult of times. As\nwe look at other issues on this Committee, I hope we will remember the\nsuccess of this program, and our capacity to use Government to solve\ntough problems when we work together.\nIn the last bipartisan authorization of the Program, we worked to\nstrike a balance, which seems to work well. By increasing the program\ntrigger to $200 million and gradually reducing the Government's share\nin the losses, we've made the program efficient without decreasing\naccess to coverage. We have an opportunity to make the program even\nstronger by creating certainty in the marketplace through a long-term\nextension of the program. I hope we can work together to do that.\nI look forward to hearing the witnesses' testimony today.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR MENENDEZ FROM TARIQUE\nNAGEER\nQ.1. TRIA reauthorization is particularly important to my home\nState of New Jersey, where there is a high population density,\nimportant cultural centers and landmarks, and major\ninfrastructure, including ports, rail, and highways.\nWhat are the consequences of letting TRIA expire for high\ntarget States like New Jersey?\nA.1. If TRIA is allowed to expire or is substantially changed,\nand the mandatory make-available provision is removed, insurers\nwould not be obliged to offer terrorism coverage. Additionally,\nthe TRIA premium charged by insurers without the backstop in\nplace is likely to be considerably higher. The United States is\nthe world's largest buyer of terrorism insurance, and U.S.-\nbased organizations continue to purchase coverage at a high\nrate. In 2018, the take-up rate for TRIPRA coverage embedded in\nU.S. property policies was 62 percent (see Figure 4). Take-up\nrates have remained close to 60 percent over the last several\nyears.\nPotentially, property reinsurance capacity and competition\ncould positively influence the supply of terrorism capacity;\nhowever, available coverage and limits would not be as readily\navailable in certain cities. In particular, this may impact\ncompanies that have substantial property exposures in central\nbusiness districts and where reinsurance capacity would be\ndiminished and insufficient to meet insurers' demands.\nAdditionally, some industries are susceptible to certain\ninsurance requirements, such as mortgage lender requirements\nwith real estate companies. Within TRIA's current structure,\nthe limits available for terrorism insurance are typically\nsufficient for real estate companies to meet their risk\ntransfer and lender requirement needs. A change in the Act's\nstructure could potentially cause a gap in demand and\navailability. This susceptibility is not limited to ``central\nbusiness districts'' or major cities.\nThe main alternative for a property terrorism risk transfer\nmechanism if TRIA is not reauthorized would be the standalone\nterrorism insurance market. As standalone capacity is finite,\nthe cost of this capacity likely would be considerably higher\nin areas or cities where demand is high, such as major\nmetropolitan areas, central business districts, iconic\nbuildings, ports/airports and even ``soft targets'' such as\nshopping malls.\nThis market dynamic varies considerably by location. In\ncertain high-risk cities--such as New York, San Francisco,\nChicago, Houston, Atlanta or Washington, D.C.--the cost of\nstandalone terrorism insurance capacity can be multiples of the\ncurrent pricing for TRIA embedded as part of property programs.\nOrganizations that employ captives also are likely to be\naffected in the event TRIA is allowed to expire or is\nsignificantly changed. Captives are widely used to supplement\nwhat is available in the commercial market, and, in some cases\ncaptive insurers are the only available option for certain\nlayers and/or perils. This is most common in areas of higher\nperceived risk, such as for property or employee-related\ncoverages in major cities. Generally speaking, since captives\nare best suited to primary operating layers, or as a mechanism\nfor accessing risk transfer solutions, it is very likely that,\nabsent TRIA, captive utilization for terrorism coverage would\nchange significantly.\nIn addition to property insurance, other coverage lines\nlikely will be impacted if TRIA expires or is significantly\nchanged, particularly workers' compensation insurance, as\nworkers' compensation insurers are not permitted to exclude\nterrorism from their policies. Insurers are concerned about\npotential aggregation of risk, which may impact the\navailability of workers' compensation insurance should TRIA\nmaterially change or expire. Where these insurers are also\noffering other lines of insurance, such as property, the\ncombined aggregate exposure likely will further limit their\nability or willingness to offer substantial property limits.\nLikely impacts that the absence of or a serious\nmodification of TRIA could have on the workers' compensation\nmarket are in the areas of pricing and capacity. It is expected\nthat the reinsurance market would likely increase pricing\nbecause of the increased potential exposure. This would, in\nturn, have a trickle-down effect on the primary workers'\ncompensation marketplace. Further, the ability of insurers to\nuse reinsurance capacity to manage their maximum tolerable\nlosses could prove more difficult, especially for the terrorism\nperils of NBCR events. This could significantly alter carriers'\nrisk appetites and their willingness to offer coverage to\nemployers with large employee accumulations.\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nQ.2. What are consequences of letting TRIA expire for\ncommunities around the country that are home to critical\ninfrastructure such as rail lines, power plants, highways,\nairports, or pipelines? If these investments become more\ncostly, doesn't that have a nationally adverse impact?\nA.2. There is insufficient standalone terrorism capacity to\ncost effectively replace TRIA. This will result in increased\nterrorism insurance costs and insurance market dislocation for\nrisks in the commercial real estate sector. This could result\nin negative economic impact for industries affected by this\ndislocation.\nThe main alternative for a property terrorism risk transfer\nmechanism if TRIA is not reauthorized would be the standalone\nterrorism insurance market. Since standalone capacity is\nfinite, the cost of this capacity likely would be considerably\nhigher in areas or cities where demand is high, such as major\nmetropolitan areas, central business districts, iconic\nbuildings, ports/airports for example.\nThe percentage of companies that purchased terrorism\ninsurance--and the amount they spent on terrorism insurance as\na portion of their overall premiums--varied significantly by\nindustry in 2018. Education institutions, media organizations,\nfinancial institutions, and real estate companies were the most\nfrequent buyers while transportation and hospitality and gaming\ncompanies spent the most on terrorism as a percentage of their\ntotal premium spend due to their perceived vulnerability (see\nFigure 5).\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nGlobal dedicated reinsurance capital is estimated to be\n$440 billion; dedicated reinsurance capital in North America is\nestimated to be between $120 billion and $140 billion.\nReinsurance capacity for terrorism, however, is dependent on a\nreinsurer's preference, appetite, expertise and aggregate\nconstraints.\nIt is not unforeseeable that changes to the backstop could\nresult in a withdrawal of smaller carriers away from the\nterrorism segment, while larger carriers may or may not\ncontinue to write--and absorb more--risk throughout the cycle\nof market dislocation. This would have an impact on the\nmarketplace with fewer options available for small businesses,\npotentially higher insurance expenses and less available for\ngrowth and investments.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR WARREN FROM TARIQUE\nNAGEER\nQ.1. Certain mass shootings, such as those that occurred in Las\nVegas, NV, Sutherland Springs, TX, and Newtown, CT, have not\nbeen certified by the Treasury Secretary as acts of terrorism.\nTherefore, these incidents have not been regarded as qualifying\nevents for terrorism risk insurance, in part, because those\nattacks did not meet current law's requirement of being ``part\nof an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United\nStates or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the\nUnited States Government by coercion.'' Given the high\nfrequency of mass shootings in the United States, is there a\npublic policy interest in certifying certain mass shootings\ncommitted by individuals as qualifying events for terrorism\nrisk insurance purposes, even if they are not demonstrably\nintended to coerce Americans or influence U.S. Government\npolicy? Please explain why or why not.\nA.1. Unfortunately, mass shootings are an important topic and,\nas such, there are policy initiatives underway to address them.\nThe private insurance market has developed forms of coverage to\nrespond to active assailant threats--helping organizations and\nindividuals victimized by such attacks to recover and mitigate\ntheir future risk. This insurance, active assailant coverage,\ncomplements the general liability and property coverage that\nmost businesses already purchase, offering another layer of\nprotection against the threat of assailants. Various active\nassailant insurance products available via commercial insurers\ntypically offer affirmative coverage that is triggered by\npremediated malicious physical attacks by active assailants who\nare physically present and armed. These policies can typically\noffer:\nA.  Property damage, business interruption, and extra expense\ncoverage;\nB.  Legal liability coverage;\nC.  Nonphysical damage coverage;\nD.  Loss of revenue and denial of access coverage;\nE.  Reimbursement for costs for public relations consulting,\ncrisis management, medical services, counseling and/or\npsychiatric care, hiring of additional staff and added\nsecurity.\nBeyond purchasing insurance coverage, it's vital that\nbusinesses carefully consider their potential risk and actively\nengage in\nprevention and response preparedness activities to help reduce\nthe\npotential loss of life, injuries, and damage to their and\nothers'\nproperty. The Department of Homeland Security offers various\nactive shooter preparation guidance on its website: https://\nwww.dhs.gov/cisa/active-shooter-preparedness.\nPlease see Addendum 1 for additional information on\ndedicated coverage for active assailant events.\nQ.2. According to Congressional Research Service (CRS)\nspecialist Baird Webel's written testimony, the current\nterrorism risk insurance program ``protect[s] consumers--by\nrequiring insurers that offer [Terrorism Risk Insurance Act]-\ncovered lines of insurance to make terrorism insurance\navailable prospectively to their commercial policyholders.''\nAre there other actions that Congress or Federal agencies could\ntake that would enhance protections for consumers in the\nterrorism risk insurance market?\nA.2. Terrorism insurance pools should continue to evolve their\nscope and scale to provide the requisite response and stability\nfor companies to operate securely.\nCertain market segments are required to provide coverage\n(e.g., workers' compensation, unlimited, and for all terror\nperils) versus having greater flexibility (e.g., property\nterrorism, particularly nuclear, biological, chemical and\nradiological terrorism coverage, where it can be excluded if\nthe insured does not elect to purchase the coverage).\nIt would be beneficial to investigate requiring elements of\nnuclear, biological, chemical and radiological terrorism\ncoverage that would allow the Federal Government to reduce its\nexposure to uninsured losses resulting from a NBCR loss\nscenario and further develop the private market appetite.\nAny actions should be reviewed with due consideration to\navoid insurers pulling out of specific coverage lines, which\nwould thus have a negative effect on policyholders due to\nreduced availability.\nQ.3. According to CRS specialist Baird Webel's written\ntestimony, ``Federal law does not limit what insurers can\ncharge for terrorism risk insurance, although State regulators\ntypically have the authority under State law to modify\nexcessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory rates.''\nWhile one of the original goals of the Terrorism Risk Insurance\nProgram is to preserve State regulation of insurance, is there\na public policy interest in developing a Federal limit on what\ninsurers can charge for terrorism risk insurance, or is the\ncurrent State-centric framework sufficient to prevent abusive\npractices in the market?\nA.3. In the current marketplace, terrorism price competition\namong insurers is driven in part by modeling the exposure and\nreviewing correlated risks across multiple terrorism exposed\nlines of business (e.g., those insuring both property and\nworkers' compensation for the same risk(s)).\nInsurers measure their accumulations of risk and price\ntheir business based on the physical address level of data and\ndifferentiates those insured(s) with different risk profiles\nwithin each covered line of business.\nThe action to minimize the negative market impact arising\nfrom the uncertainty around TRIA's future and serve the\nmarketplace well would be to provide clear guidance on how a\nreauthorization might look, as soon as possible. Subject\npolicies with effective dates on (and after) January 1, 2020,\nthat are issued with annual terms, are creating a potential\n(and unknown) increased net exposure to insurers post the\nscheduled December 31, 2020, expiration of TRIA.\nThe uncertainty with TRIA will cause insurance carriers to\nconsider issuing unilateral policy endorsement provisions that\nwill allow them to increase the price for terrorism coverage\nmid-term once it is known how TRIA will look going forward\n(either materially changed or nonrenewed) post its expiration.\nThis effectively pushes the uncertainty in the market to the\ncommercial insurance buyers and employers of all sizes.\nFurther, it leaves open for interpretation the definition of\n``materially changed'' and eliminates the ability for the\ninsurance buyer to maintain coverage and cost certainty.\nQ.4. On December 27, 2016, the Treasury Department issued\n``guidance regarding how insurance recently classified as\n`Cyber Liability' for purposes of reporting premiums and losses\nto State insurance regulators will be treated under TRIA and\nTreasury's regulations for the Program (Program regulations).''\nThat guidance ``confirms that stand-alone cyber insurance\npolicies reported under the `Cyber Liability' line are included\nin the definition of `property and casualty insurance' under\nTRIA and are thus subject to the disclosure requirements and\nother requirements in TRIA and the Program regulations[.]\nFurthermore, that guidance noted, ``Cyber risk insurance\nremains an evolving insurance market, both in terms of product\ndevelopment and regulatory oversight.'' Similarly, cyberspace\nremains a consistently evolving threat environment. At this\ntime, would you recommend any updates to the Treasury\nDepartment's guidance on cyber insurance policies? Please\nexplain why or why not.\nA.4. TRIA serves an essential role to the insurance market by\ninjecting stability into several terrorism-related lines of\ninsurance. With regard to cybersecurity, terrorism remains a\npresent and growing threat vector. That risk is typically\ncovered under cyber insurance policies, but may also impact\nother lines of coverage, including property or workers'\ncompensation.\nOne hurdle for using TRIA to address acts of cyberterrorism\ncould be the challenge of attribution. ``Attribution of attacks\ncan be difficult. This is usually dependent on technical means\nof attribution. In malicious cyber actions, spoofing or\nobfuscation of an identity most often occurs. It is not easy to\nknow who conducts malicious cyber activity.''\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ ``Strategies for Resolving the Cyber Attribution Challenge,''\nU.S. Air Force Research Institute (accessed at https://\nmedia.defense.gov/2017/May/11/2001745613/-1/-1/0/CPP_0001_yanna\nkogeorgos_cyber_ttribution_challenge.pdf).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCongress should consider whether the Secretary of the\nTreasury can declare a certified act of terrorism without\ncertain attribution. Potentially, the Secretary could have the\nflexibility to certify an act of terrorism based on factors\nsuch as the objective of the attack and the impact of the\nattack.\nGuidance on the Secretary's flexibility could potential be\naddressed in the report language that accompanies the passage\nof a reauthorization of TRIPRA.\nAddendum 1\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR JONES FROM TARIQUE\nNAGEER\nQ.1. Cyber attacks are gaining traction as a preferred method\nto terrorize individuals and organizations. In 2016, the\nTreasury Department issued guidance that clarified\ncyberterrorism is included in TRIA.\nSome believe that Russia interference in the 2016\nPresidential election by manipulating voters with fake\nsocial media accounts is considered cyberterrorism.\nThis type of cyber-\nterrorism has immeasurable consequences and affects\nAmericans that would not even participate in TRIA.\nAdditionally, the Port of Mobile keeps track of\ncontainers that are to be shipped across the country.\nThe Port of Mobile is an important part of Alabama's\neconomy. If an organization decided to pressure Alabama\ninto particular policy positions by attacking their\ncomputer system it would have dramatic effects on\nbusiness owners dependent on the Port to ship their\nmerchandise.\nWhat cyberterrorism looks like and the effects on\npeople is very different from physical terrorist\nattacks. How should TRIA adapt to the growing\nprevalence of cyber attacks that gives private\ninsurance a backstop but also provides policy holders\nwith protection?\nA.1. In 2016, the U.S. Department of the Treasury responded to\nthe growing risk of cyberterrorism by clarifying that losses\nincurred under cyber insurance policies would be eligible under\nTRIA.\nAccordingly, TRIA may already serve as a backstop for cyber\ninsurance carriers in the event of a certified act of\ncyberterrorism. Moreover, acts of terrorism, including acts of\ncyberterrorism, may not qualify for TRIA because the impacts of\nthose attacks fail to meet the statutory loss thresholds.\nAt this time, there is no basis to believe that TRIA should\nbe altered to provide further support to the cyber insurance\nindustry, or to support other covered lines of insurance for\ncyber perils. However, Congress may consider how systemic risks\nmay arise from cyber attacks that do not qualify as acts of\ncyberterrorism, and how well the Nation is prepared to respond\nto such systemic attacks.\nQ.2. Often TRIA is discussed with large cities in mind, but\nmany smaller communities can be targets of terrorist\nactivities. This is shown with the Charleston, South Carolina,\nchurch shooting when a white supremacist murdered nine people.\nSmall communities like this are likely to receive insurance\nfrom local agents.\nAlso, Alabama is home to two extremely popular\nfootball teams, University of Alabama and Auburn\nUniversity. The Iron Bowl is an annual game between\nAlabama and Auburn and draws large crowds from each\nschool. This could easily be a target for terrorist\norganizations.\nHow would reforms to TRIA affect smaller\ncommunities, particularly their premiums and the extent\nof their coverage?\nA.2. A change in the $200m industry loss may have an outsized\nimpact on small carriers if:\nA.  A loss occurs in a region/facility with few other insured\nstructures or employees in close proximity;\nB.  The carrier in question is liable for the majority\ninsured loss, i.e., this is not a subscription risk and\nis placed almost entirely with one market;\nC.  In a year with a ``swarm'' of small attacks, the insurer\nin question takes a loss from one or two small-to-\nmoderate size losses, but the total damage to the U.S.\nproperty/casualty industry is not significant and fails\nto qualify for certification.\nSmall carriers could surmount this challenge by managing\ndeployed limits and diversifying their footprints away from\nregions/locations of peak exposures. This could come at the\ncost of competitiveness or availability of capacity for\npolicyholders and have a negative short-term impact on the\ncarrier.\nOne way to mitigate the impact of these changes would be to\nphase in the aggregate increase over a defined period of time,\ne.g., $25m increase per year for a decade. This would allow for\nmore manageable budgeting and business planning, and mitigate\nmarket disruption.\nChanging the company deductible, however, would likely have\nan even more pronounced impact, especially on the small\ninsurers. For example, if the company deductible were to\nincrease by 10 points to 30 percent, a majority of small-to-\nmedium sized carriers who rely more on TRIA's existence, and\nwhose program deductible represents the largest percentage of\npolicyholder surplus, will have to re-strategize regarding the\ncompany's:\nA.  Defined per occurrence risk tolerance;\nB.  Reinsurance buying strategy;\nC.  Aggregate amount of limit deployed in the marketplace;\nD.  Pricing for terrorism risk;\nE.  Ratings agency scrutiny.\nRatings agency scrutiny is particularly important for small\nand mutual carriers. Carriers must submit annual assessments of\ntheir net-of-TRIPRA and reinsurance accumulations. An increase\nin the deductible mid-term could potentially lead to a gap in\nterrorism reinsurance coverage, and consequently, could lead to\na failed stress test. If this were to occur, it may damage the\nfirm's financial strength rating, and impede its ability to\nsecure new business.\nIn 2017, nearly 800 U.S.-based carriers wrote $215 billion\nin TRIPRA-eligible premium, with a combined policyholder\nsurplus (PHS) of $733 billion.\nConsidering the current 20 percent deductible requirement\nand PHS as a filter, Guy Carpenter's analysis concludes that\nsmall- to mid-size insurers could be substantially more\nvulnerable to the annual increases in the TRIPRA industry\ntrigger and their overall net retentions as a percentage of PHS\n(see Table 1).\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nInsurers with $1 billion in surplus and relatively larger\nTRIPRA deductibles (over $200 million) tend to manage their\nconventional terrorism exposures and accumulations rather than\nbe dependent on TRIPRA recoveries.\nInsurers with less than $500 million in surplus and\nrelatively more exposure to terrorism losses are more likely to\nfall under the widening ``TRIPRA coverage gap'' that exposes\nthem to a loss scenario where TRIPRA may not be industry\ntriggered, leaving private reinsurance as their only source of\nsurplus protection.\nIt is not unforeseeable that changes to the backstop could\nresult in a withdrawal of smaller carriers away from the\nterrorism segment, while larger carriers may or may not\ncontinue to write--and absorb more--risk throughout the cycle\nof market dislocation. This would have an impact on the\nmarketplace with fewer options available for small businesses,\npotentially higher insurance expenses and less capital\navailable for growth and investments.\nIf changes are considered, we would recommend gradually\nphasing in any increases in the deductible over a planned time\nhorizon. This would mitigate short-term market disruptions and\nallow smaller companies time to adequately capitalize\nthemselves to take on an increased share within the private\nmarket.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SINEMA FROM TARIQUE\nNAGEER\nQ.1. What types of uncertainty will the insurance market and\ninsured entities experience if Congress waits too long to\nconsider reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act\n(TRIA)? How will that timing affect entities seeking coverage\nor renewal of coverage?\nA.1. The uncertainty around the future of the Terrorism Risk\nInsurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA)--scheduled to\nexpire on December 31, 2020--can significantly affect the\nproperty/casualty insurance industry.\nIf TRIPRA is not renewed by Congress, the property\ninsurance industry will be left with no Federal backstop for\nlosses from certified acts of terrorism. As policies with\neffective dates after December 31, 2019, may extend beyond the\nexpiration date of the legislation, insurers must determine in\nadvance how to deal with their terrorism exposures as of that\ndate.\nProperty insurers may either accept the terrorism liability\non all in-force policies on a fully net basis or place sunset\nclauses on policies written after December 31, 2020. Such a\nclause would cancel the terrorism coverage effective December\n31, 2020, if legislation extending TRIPRA is not passed by\nCongress and signed by the President.\nIn addition to property insurance, other coverage lines\nlikely will be impacted if TRIA expires or is significantly\nchanged, particularly workers' compensation insurance, as\nworkers' compensation insurers are not permitted to exclude\nterrorism from their policies. Insurers are concerned about\npotential aggregation of risk, which may impact the\navailability of workers' compensation insurance should TRIA\nmaterially change or expire. Where these insurers are also\noffering other lines of insurance, such as property, the\ncombined aggregate exposure likely will further limit their\nability or willingness to offer substantial property limits.\nLikely impacts that the absence of or a serious\nmodification of TRIA could have on the workers' compensation\nmarket are in the areas of pricing and capacity. It is expected\nthat the reinsurance market would likely increase pricing\nbecause of the increased potential exposure. This would, in\nturn, have a trickle-down effect on the primary workers'\ncompensation marketplace. Further, the ability of insurers to\nuse reinsurance capacity to manage their maximum tolerable\nlosses could prove more difficult, especially for the terrorism\nperils of NBCR events. This could significantly alter carriers'\nrisk appetites and their willingness to offer coverage to\nemployers with large employee accumulations.\nQ.2. Should a lapse in terrorism coverage provided by TRIA\noccur, what effects do you foresee on the availability and\npricing of said coverage?\nA.2. If Congress does not extend or renew TRIPRA, the market\ndynamics for terrorism insurance will be further disrupted and\nmay result in increased pricing as capacity shrinks.\nIn the absence of a federally mandated offer of TRIA\nterrorism coverage, there remains the strong likelihood that\ninsurance and capital markets will choose not to offer\nterrorism coverage--using the premise that there is a higher\ncertainty of returns elsewhere.\nTRIA's expiration or substantial modification at extension\nwill\nalmost certainly affect embedded TRIA coverage, standalone\nterrorism pricing/demand for capacity and TRIA captive\nprograms. Terrorism insurance capacity may be difficult to\nacquire at reasonable cost for insureds with significant\nexposures in a central business district of a major (Tier 1)\ncity, or if the properties are\nperceived as potential targets for terrorism attacks, and/or\nwhere there have been instances of foiled plots.\nThe main alternative for a property terrorism risk transfer\nmechanism if TRIA is not reauthorized would be the standalone\nterrorism insurance market. As standalone capacity is finite,\nthe cost of this capacity likely would be considerably higher\nin areas or cities where demand is high, such as major\nmetropolitan areas,\ncentral business districts, iconic buildings, ports/airports,\nand even ``soft targets'' such as shopping malls.\nThis market dynamic varies considerably by location. In\ncertain high-risk cities--such as New York, San Francisco,\nChicago, Houston, Atlanta or Washington, D.C.--the cost of\nstandalone terrorism insurance capacity can be multiples of the\ncurrent pricing for TRIA embedded as part of property programs.\nOrganizations that employ captives also are likely to be\naffected in the event TRIA is allowed to expire or is\nsignificantly changed. Captives are widely used to supplement\nwhat is available in the commercial market, and, in some cases\ncaptive insurers are the only available option for certain\nlayers and/or perils. This is most common in areas of higher\nperceived risk, such as for property or employee-related\ncoverages in major cities. Generally speaking, since captives\nare best suited to primary operating layers, or as a mechanism\nfor accessing risk transfer solutions, it is very likely that,\nabsent TRIA, captive utilization for terrorism coverage would\nchange significantly.\nQ.3. In December 2016, the Department of the Treasury issued\nguidance which clarified that losses from cyber-terrorist\nattacks were to be treated the same as commercial property and\ncasualty losses. Do you think this guidance sufficiently covers\nall forms of cyber attacks?\nA.3. The December 2016 guidance from the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury addressed a unique issue related to TRIA's coverage of\ncyber perils.\nA core insuring agreement for cyber insurance is data asset\nrestoration. When malware encrypts, corrupts or destroys data,\na cyber insurance policy can reimburse the cost to restore or\nrecreate that data. This coverage may also include\nreimbursement for the cost of replacing servers, devices or\nother components that have been corrupted beyond repair, often\nreferred to as ``bricking.'' In addition to this coverage being\navailable in the cyber insurance market, some property carriers\nmay also offer this coverage. Other carriers, however, may\nexclude this coverage because the loss does not result from a\nphysical event, such as fire or explosion.\nPrior to December 2016, Treasury was silent on whether\ncyber insurance should be included or excluded from TRIA. As a\nresult, if a quickly replicating, data destroying malware\ncreated a widespread data corruption event and corresponding\nloss of revenue from business interruption, such as NotPetya,\nTRIA may have responded differently to losses under property\ninsurance policies and cyber insurance policies, even though\nthey responded to the same losses from the same peril.\nAccordingly, Treasury's guidance clarified that losses from\ncyber-terrorist attacks that were subject to the coverage of\ncyber insurance policies were to be treated the same as\ncommercial property and casualty losses.\nQ.4. How do insurers effectively measure and quantify loss from\ncyber attacks?\nA.4. One of Marsh's services as a trusted cyber-risk adviser is\nto help quantify the potential impact of a cyber attack and to\nhelp clients establish controls for ongoing assessment of cyber\nrisk. In some instances, such as data breaches, this can be\nbased on modeling from prior claims activity. In other\ninstances, such as losses from loss of revenues and extra\nexpense from malware events, the lack of claims history may\nrequire alternative means of quantification that involves\nassessment of clients' cyber assets, review of the client's\nprocess and procedures for protecting assets and proposing\nscenarios that could lead to large loss. With collaborative\nengagements by Marsh brokers and consultants, Marsh offers\nclients the opportunity to dispel the uncertainty of their\ncyber exposures and devote adequate resources with optimal\nresults.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR MENENDEZ FROM HOWARD\nKUNREUTHER\nQ.1. TRIA reauthorization is particularly important to my home\nState of New Jersey, where there is a high population density,\nimportant cultural centers and landmarks, and major\ninfrastructure, including ports, rail, and highways.\nWhat are the consequences of letting TRIA expire for high\ntarget States like New Jersey?\nA.1. The consequences of letting TRIA expire for high target\nStates like New Jersey could be highly significant because many\nprivate insurers will likely refuse to offer coverage against\nterrorism losses to commercial firms because of a concern with\nthe consequences of a catastrophic loss to their operations.\nThose insurers considering offering coverage will very likely\ncharge much higher premiums than if they are protected by TRIA.\nThe likelihood of a cyber-terrorist attack and its consequences\nare highly ambiguous so they will focus on worst case scenarios\nin specifying the price of terrorism coverage.\nQ.2. What are consequences of letting TRIA expire for\ncommunities around the country that are home to critical\ninfrastructure such as rail lines, power plants, highways,\nairports, or pipelines? If these investments become more\ncostly, doesn't that have a nationally adverse impact?\nA.2. If TRIA expires and critical infrastructure is uninsured\nand suffers a severe loss from a terrorist attack, this would\nhave a\nnationally adverse impact. The President might issue a disaster\ndeclaration so that Federal assistance could be provided.\nIncluding infrastructure losses as part of TRIA could encourage\ninvestments now in mitigating future losses through long-term\nloans and premium reductions, as noted in my testimony.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR WARREN FROM HOWARD\nKUNREUTHER\nQ.1. Certain mass shootings, such as those that occurred in Las\nVegas, NV, Sutherland Springs, TX, and Newtown, CT, have not\nbeen certified by the Treasury Secretary as acts of terrorism.\nTherefore, these incidents have not been regarded as qualifying\nevents for terrorism risk insurance, in part, because those\nattacks did not meet current law's requirement of being ``part\nof an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United\nStates or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the\nUnited States Government by coercion.'' Given the high\nfrequency of mass shootings in the United States, is there a\npublic policy interest in certifying certain mass shootings\ncommitted by individuals as qualifying events for terrorism\nrisk insurance purposes, even if they are not demonstrably\nintended to coerce Americans or influence U.S. Government\npolicy? Please explain why or why not.\nA.1. To address this important issue, the Department of the\nTreasury needs to interact with private insurers to determine\nwhether insurers now provide protection against mass shootings\nthat may not be caused by terrorists. If there is sufficient\nprivate insurance coverage then it may not be necessary to\ninclude these events under TRIA. If there is limited coverage\nagainst mass shootings, then it will be important to determine\nwho pays for the losses from these events and whether a case\ncan be made to consider including these events under TRIA when\nit is considered for renewal in 2020.\nQ.2. According to Congressional Research Service (CRS)\nspecialist Baird Webel's written testimony, the current\nterrorism risk insurance program ``protect[s] consumers--by\nrequiring insurers that offer [Terrorism Risk Insurance Act]-\ncovered lines of insurance to make terrorism insurance\navailable prospectively to their commercial policyholders.''\nAre there other actions that Congress or Federal agencies could\ntake that would enhance protections for consumers in the\nterrorism risk insurance market?\nA.2. No response provided.\nQ.3. According to CRS specialist Baird Webel's written\ntestimony, ``Federal law does not limit what insurers can\ncharge for terrorism risk insurance, although State regulators\ntypically have the authority under State law to modify\nexcessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory rates.''\nWhile one of the original goals of the Terrorism Risk Insurance\nProgram is to preserve State regulation of insurance, is there\na public policy interest in developing a Federal limit on what\ninsurers can charge for terrorism risk insurance, or is the\ncurrent State-centric framework sufficient to prevent abusive\npractices in the market?\nA.3. I feel that insurers should be able to charge premiums\nthat reflect their risks, so State regulators should not\nrestrict the premiums insurers can charge. It will be important\nfor State regulators to make sure that the premiums are high\nenough so that the insurers has a low chance of insolvency if\nit suffers a catastrophic loss. One of the important reasons\nfor renewing TRIA is to provide a Federal backstop if insurers'\ntotal losses exceed a certain amount. In my testimony I\nindicated that the Wharton Risk Center's study revealed that\ntotal insured losses from a terrorist attack would have to\nexceed $60 billion before the Federal Government would be\nresponsible for covering any insured losses.\nQ.4. On December 27, 2016, the Treasury Department issued\n``guidance regarding how insurance recently classified as\n`Cyber Liability' for purposes of reporting premiums and losses\nto State insurance regulators will be treated under TRIA and\nTreasury's regulations for the Program (Program regulations).''\nThat guidance ``confirms that stand-alone cyber insurance\npolicies reported under the `Cyber Liability' line are included\nin the definition of `property and casualty insurance' under\nTRIA and are thus subject to the disclosure requirements and\nother requirements in TRIA and the Program regulations[.]\nFurthermore, that guidance noted, ``Cyber risk insurance\nremains an evolving insurance market, both in terms of product\ndevelopment and regulatory oversight.'' Similarly, cyberspace\nremains a consistently evolving threat environment. At this\ntime, would you recommend any updates to the Treasury\nDepartment's guidance on cyber insurance policies? Please\nexplain why or why not.\nA.4. In my testimony I noted that cyberterrorism is an\ninterdependent risk where compromising one computer network can\ncause losses to many others in the interconnected system. The\nexistence of such interdependencies provides challenges to\ninsurers in determining whether to offer protection against\nthis risk in their terrorism coverage and if so what premium to\ncharge. For this reason I feel that it is important that the\nDepartment of the Treasury interact with private insurers to\ndetermine whether cyberterrorism should be included under the\nTRIA backstop. By including it in TRIA both private insurers\nand the Federal Government would form a private-public\npartnership to deal with a risk where the likelihood of a\ncyber-terrorist attack and its consequences are highly\nambiguous. With a backstop from the Federal Government if the\nlosses from a cyber terrorist were extremely large, insurers\nwould feel more comfortable insuring this risk and would\nconsider charging a lower premium than if they were fully\nresponsible for a catastrophic loss.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR JONES FROM HOWARD\nKUNREUTHER\nQ.1. Cyber attacks are gaining traction as a preferred method\nto terrorize individuals and organizations. In 2016, the\nTreasury Department issued guidance that clarified\ncyberterrorism is included in TRIA.\nSome believe that Russia interference in the 2016\nPresidential election by manipulating voters with fake social\nmedia accounts is considered cyberterrorism. This type of\ncyberterrorism has immeasurable consequences and effects\nAmericans that would not even participate in TRIA.\nAdditionally, the Port of Mobile keeps track of containers\nthat are to be shipped across the country. The Port of Mobile\nis an important part of Alabama's economy. If an organization\ndecided to pressure Alabama into particular policy positions by\nattacking their computer system it would have dramatic effects\non business owners dependent on the Port to ship their\nmerchandise.\nWhat cyberterrorism looks like and the effects on people is\nvery different from physical terrorist attacks. How should TRIA\nadapt to the growing prevalence of cyber attacks that gives\nprivate insurance a backstop but also provides policy holders\nwith protection?\nA.1. In my testimony I noted that cyberterrorism is an\ninterdependent risk, where compromising one computer network\ncan cause losses to many others in the interconnected system.\nThe existence of such interdependencies provides challenges to\ninsurers in determining whether to offer protection against\nthis risk in their terrorism coverage and, if so, what premium\nto charge. For this reason I feel that it is important that the\nDepartment of the\nTreasury interact with private insurers to determine whether\ncyberterrorism should be included under the TRIA backstop. By\nincluding it in TRIA, both private insurers and the Federal\nGovernment would form a private-public partnership to deal with\na risk where the likelihood of a cyber-terrorist attack and its\nconsequences are highly ambiguous. With a backstop from the\nFederal Government, if the losses from a cyber terrorist were\nextremely large, insurers would feel more comfortable insuring\nthis risk and would consider charging a lower premium than if\nthey were fully responsible for a catastrophic loss.\nQ.2. Often TRIA is discussed with large cities in mind, but\nmany smaller communities can be targets of terrorist\nactivities. This is shown with the Charleston, South Carolina,\nchurch shooting when a white supremacist murdered nine people.\nSmall communities like this are likely to receive insurance\nfrom local agents.\nAlso, Alabama is home to two extremely popular football\nteams, University of Alabama and Auburn University. The Iron\nBowl is an annual game between Alabama and Auburn and draws\nlarge crowds from each school. This could easily be a target\nfor terrorist organizations.\nHow would reforms to TRIA affect smaller communities,\nparticularly their premiums and the extent of their coverage?\nA.2. In setting premiums for terrorist coverage, insurers are\nconcerned with the size of the program trigger for TRIA. In\n2020 if a terrorist attack creates insured losses less than\n$200 million, then TRIA will not be triggered. In this case\nthere will be no Federal backstop. If insurers are concerned\nwith having to be responsible for the total losses from mass\nshootings or a terrorist attack in a small community, they are\nlikely to charge higher premiums and reduce their coverage.\nSome insurers may decide not to provide protection against mass\nshootings or to firms in smaller communities from losses from a\nterrorist attack. In considering the\nrenewal of TRIA, consideration should be given to the size of\nthe program trigger and whether losses from mass shootings from\nterrorists should be covered by TRIA even if the total insured\nlosses were lower than the TRIA program trigger. If losses from\nmass shootings would be covered by TRIA, insurers are likely to\ncharge lower premiums and provide more coverage against these\nterrorist-related disasters.\n------\nRESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION OF SENATOR SINEMA FROM HOWARD\nKUNREUTHER\nQ.1. In December 2016, the Department of the Treasury issued\nguidance which clarified that losses from cyber-terrorist\nattacks were to be treated the same as commercial property and\ncasualty losses. Do you think this guidance sufficiently covers\nall forms of cyber attacks? How do insurers effectively measure\nand quantify loss from cyber attacks?\nA.1. In my testimony I noted that cyberterrorism is an\ninterdependent risk where compromising one computer network can\ncause losses to many others in the interconnected system. The\nexistence of such interdependencies provides challenges to\ninsurers in determining whether to offer protection against\nthis risk in their terrorism coverage and if so what premium to\ncharge.

TRIA reauthorization is particularly important to my home\nState of New Jersey, where there is a high population density,\nimportant cultural centers and landmarks, and major\ninfrastructure, including ports, rail, and highways.\nWhat are the consequences of letting TRIA expire for high\ntarget States like New Jersey?\nWhat are consequences of letting TRIA expire for\ncommunities around the country that are home to critical\ninfrastructure such as rail lines, power plants, highways,\nairports, or pipelines? If these investments become more\ncostly, doesn't that have a nationally adverse impact?\nA.1. TRIA acts to lower the cost of terrorism insurance in two\nprimary ways. (1) It directly subsidizes terrorism insurance by\nproviding reinsurance coverage for no upfront premiums; and (2)\nit expands the supply of terrorism insurance through the\nrequirement that companies offer terrorism insurance to\ncommercial policyholders. TRIA expiration would remove both the\ndirect subsidy and the extra supply from the market and thus\nwould likely raise the cost of terrorism insurance. The impact\nof this would be felt to the greatest extent in high target\nStates as insurers would likely seek to reduce their overall\nexposure to such States. In addition, it would be in such\nStates that lenders would be most likely to require terrorism\ncoverage before providing loans for large commercial real\nestate projects. A similar dynamic would also come into play\nwith critical infrastructure, thus raising costs for such\nprojects and potentially having a nationally adverse impact as\ncritical infrastructure is necessary for the economy\nnationwide. If TRIA were to expire, however, Congress might\nalso consider redirecting the resources that are devoted to\nTRIA to some other use that could support critical\ninfrastructure.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR WARREN FROM BAIRD\nWEBEL\nQ.1. Certain mass shootings, such as those that occurred in Las\nVegas, NV, Sutherland Springs, TX, and Newtown, CT, have not\nbeen certified by the Treasury Secretary as acts of terrorism.\nTherefore, these incidents have not been regarded as qualifying\nevents for terrorism risk insurance, in part, because those\nattacks did not meet current law's requirement of being ``part\nof an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United\nStates or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the\nU.S. Government by coercion.'' Given the high frequency of mass\nshootings in the United States, is there a public policy\ninterest in certifying certain mass shootings committed by\nindividuals as qualifying events for terrorism risk insurance\npurposes, even if they are not demonstrably intended to coerce\nAmericans or influence U.S. Government policy? Please explain\nwhy or why not.\nA.1. TRIA requires the following for certification of a\nterrorist attack under the statute. An act must:\n(i)   to be an act of terrorism;\n(ii)  to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to----\n(I)    human life;\n(II)   property; or\n(III)   infrastructure;\n(iii)  to have resulted in damage within the United States,\nor outside of the United States in the case of----\n(I)   an air carrier or vessel described in paragraph\n(5)(B); or\n(II)   the premises of a United States mission; and\n(iv)  to have been committed by an individual or individuals,\nas part of an effort to coerce the civilian population\nof the United States or to influence the policy or\naffect the conduct of the U.S. Government by coercion.\nIn addition, the statute requires that the act of terrorism\ncause more than $5 million in aggregate property casualty\ninsurance losses in order to be certified. Losses incurred for\nin health or life insurance are not covered under TRIA.\nThe certification of an event as an act of terrorism under\nTRIA serves a relatively narrow statutory purpose. It solely\nrelates to potential sharing of insured losses by the Federal\nGovernment and is not referenced in other national security or\njudicial statutes. In past experience, particularly following\nthe 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, the President in a statement\nidentified an attack as an act of terror, but the relatively\nlow level of insured property casualty losses meant that, under\nthe TRIA criteria, it could not be certified regardless of the\nmotives involved. Due to the precise nature of terrorism\nexclusions in insurance policies covering some of the Boston\nbusinesses who suffered losses due to the bombing, TRIA\ncertification in that case would likely have resulted in\ncoverage gaps and less payments to insureds.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ See, for example, ``Mass. Regulator on Boston Bombing Claims,\nTRIA Reauthorization Effort,'' Insurance Journal, April 23, 2014, at\nhttps://www.insurancejournal.com/news/east/2014/04/23/327033.htm; and\n``Insurance Payout May Depend on Whether Boston Bombing Was `Terrorist\nAct,' '' ABC News, at https://abcnews.go.com/Business/boston-firms-\nwait-terrorism-certification-insurance-payout/story?id=19043385.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMany mass shooting events may fall into a similar category\nas the Marathon bombing. While they may inflict a tragic toll\non the life and health of those involved, mass shootings may\nnot cause losses in commercial property casualty insurance\nsufficient to meet the TRIA criteria for certification. In such\ncases, only addressing the TRIA criteria with regard to motives\nmay have relatively little effect on potential certification of\nmass shootings as terrorist events under TRIA. In addition,\ncertification is only the first threshold that must be crossed\nbefore the Government would share losses under TRIA. The\ncombination of the program trigger and the insurer deductible\nmake it unlikely that the certification of most mass shootings\nas eligible for coverage under TRIA would result in any actual\nloss sharing.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\2\\ For example, recent press reports suggest approximately $750\nmillion in insured damages for the Las Vegas shooting (``MGM Sees $800\nMillion Las Vegas Shooting Settlement; $751 Million Covered by\nInsurance,'' Insurance Journal, May 20, 2019). The primary insurer\nreported was Zurich American Insurance (``MGM Resorts Sues Zurich\nAmerican Insurance for Las Vegas Shooting Defense Costs,'' Insurance\nJournal, June 24, 2019). According to data supplied to CRS by the\nTreasury Department, Zurich's TRIA insurer deductible would be\napproximately $1.4 billion. Thus, if the press reports are accurate,\neven if the Las Vegas shooting were certified, no Federal loss sharing\nwould occur.\nQ.2. According to Congressional Research Service (CRS)\nspecialist Baird Webel's written testimony, the current\nterrorism risk insurance program ``protect[s] consumers--by\nrequiring insurers that offer [Terrorism Risk Insurance Act]-\ncovered lines of insurance to make terrorism insurance\navailable prospectively to their commercial policyholders.''\nAre there other actions that Congress or Federal agencies could\ntake that would enhance protections for consumers in the\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nterrorism risk insurance market?\nA.2. Beyond the ``make available'' provisions TRIA effectively\nleaves terrorism insurance consumer protection issues (such as\naffordability of terrorism insurance or the precise details of\nterrorism insurance policies) to the State insurance regulators\nas is the case in commercial insurance generally. This primacy\nof State insurance regulation is codified in the 1945 McCarran-\nFerguson Act.\\3\\ It is possible for Congress to revisit this\naspect of McCarran-Ferguson with regard to terrorism insurance,\nas was done to a degree in the original 2002 TRIA, which also\nnullified terrorism exclusions that previously had been\napproved by State insurance regulators at the time. Such\nincreased Federal oversight of terrorism insurance, however,\nwould require specific statutory change as the Federal agencies\nwho might provide such oversight, including the Department of\nthe Treasury, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the\nFederal Trade Commission, currently have little or no authority\nto oversee insurance.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\3\\ Codified at 15 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  1011-1015.\nQ.3. According to CRS specialist Baird Webel's written\ntestimony, ``Federal law does not limit what insurers can\ncharge for terrorism risk insurance, although State regulators\ntypically have the authority under State law to modify\nexcessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory rates.''\nWhile one of the original goals of the Terrorism Risk Insurance\nProgram is to preserve State regulation of insurance, is there\na public policy interest in developing a Federal limit on what\ninsurers can charge for terrorism risk insurance, or is the\ncurrent State-centric framework sufficient to prevent abusive\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\npractices in the market?\nA.3. The State regulatory system generally treats commercial\ninsurance lines, such as those covered under TRIA, to less\ndirect oversight on consumer protection grounds than personal\nlines, such as homeowners insurance or automobile insurance.\nThis is typically justified on the grounds that the businesses\npurchasing commercial lines are seen as sophisticated consumers\nwho are better able to understand insurance contracts and seek\nout the best prices.\\4\\ Thus, for example, there is little\ndirect rate regulation in commercial insurance compared to\npersonal insurance where some States require prior approval of\nrate changes, or have after-the-fact approval processes.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\4\\ Similar theories are present in financial regulation under\nFederal law, such as the concept of an ``accredited investor'' used by\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission. See CRS Report IF11278,\n``Accredited Investor Definition and Private Securities Markets,'' by\nEva Su.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRecent Treasury and private data on terrorism insurance\npricing has generally been interpreted as signaling no\nsignificant problems in the market; and CRS is unaware of any\nState departments of insurance taking public action against\ninsurers for excessive rates on terrorism insurance. Overall\naverage rates can, however, mask individual markets that may be\nfacing difficulties. It is within Congress' purview to\ninvestigate complaints of excessive rates and enact changes\naddressing any issues found. Since Congress has found the\navailability of terrorism insurance important enough on public\npolicy grounds to create and extend the TRIA program, this\nmight also be sufficient grounds to justify additional Federal\nattention to the affordability of terrorism insurance.\nQ.4. On December 27, 2016, the Treasury Department issued\n``guidance regarding how insurance recently classified as\n`Cyber Liability' for purposes of reporting premiums and losses\nto State insurance regulators will be treated under TRIA and\nTreasury's regulations for the Program (Program regulations).''\nThat guidance ``confirms that stand-alone cyber insurance\npolicies reported under the `Cyber Liability' line are included\nin the definition of `property and casualty insurance' under\nTRIA and are thus subject to the disclosure requirements and\nother requirements in TRIA and the Program regulations[.]\nFurthermore, that guidance noted, ``Cyber risk insurance\nremains an evolving insurance market, both in terms of product\ndevelopment and regulatory oversight.'' Similarly, cyberspace\nremains a consistently evolving threat environment. At this\ntime, would you recommend any updates to the Treasury\nDepartment's guidance on cyber insurance policies? Please\nexplain why or why not.\nA.4. The years since the Treasury guidance have not\nsubstantially altered the evolving and uncertain nature of\ncyber insurance. The combined public-private nature of TRIA,\nhowever, provides significant space for private insurers to\ninnovate in the coverages offered for cyber risk while still\nremaining under the reinsurance backstop provided by TRIA.\nTreasury's guidance seems clear that policies in the new cyber\nliability line of insurance are eligible for TRIA coverage.\nThis does not mean, however, that there might not be future\nissues relating to TRIA coverage in the case of a cyber-\nterrorist attack. For example, if the exact perpetrators are\nunknown, it may be difficult for Treasury to certify the attack\nunder the criteria contained in the TRIA statute. It is also\npossible that a substantial attack might occur but be under the\nvarious thresholds in the law that limit Federal sharing of\nterrorism losses. Addressing such issues, however, would be\nbeyond Treasury's authority to address in guidance and would\ninstead require amendments by Congress to the underlying\nstatute.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR JONES FROM BAIRD\nWEBEL\nQ.1. Cyber attacks are gaining traction as a preferred method\nto terrorize individuals and organizations. In 2016, the\nTreasury Department issued guidance that clarified\ncyberterrorism is included in TRIA.\nSome believe that Russia interference in the 2016\nPresidential election by manipulating voters with fake social\nmedia accounts is considered cyberterrorism.

The Port of Mobile\nis an important part of Alabama's economy. If an organization\ndecided to pressure Alabama into particular policy positions by\nattacking their computer system it would have dramatic effects\non business owners dependent on the Port to ship their\nmerchandise.\nWhat cyberterrorism looks like and the effects on people is\nvery different from physical terrorist attacks. How should TRIA\nadapt to the growing prevalence of cyber attacks that gives\nprivate insurance a backstop but also provides policy holders\nwith protection?\nA.1. While TRIA does not directly address cyberterrorism, the\nflexibility inherent in the combined public/private nature of\nthe program has allowed cyberterrorism to be covered by TRIA\nwithout specific statutory changes. As long as private\ninsurance policies are covering cyberterrorism, TRIA will as\nwell even if the effects of a cyber-terrorist attack may be\nsubstantially different than other forms of terrorism. The\npurchase of cyber insurance by businesses is growing, however\nit may not be reaching coverage levels that would be considered\noptimal from a public policy perspective. For example, higher\ncoverage levels could be desired since insurance often serves\nto mitigate damage through mechanisms like information sharing\non best practices.\nThere are some aspects of the TRIA design that may not be\noptimal if the desire is to promote the purchase of cyber\ninsurance and ensure that TRIA provides coverage for a\nterrorist attack via cyberspace. For example, the program\ntrigger, currently at $180 million and set to go to $200\nmillion, and the 20 percent insurer deductible are high enough\nthat the insured loss levels from many cyber attacks may not\ncross the thresholds and result in TRIA loss sharing. In\naddition, the definition of an act of terrorism in the statute\nrequires than an act be ``committed by an individual or\nindividuals, as part of an effort to coerce the civilian\npopulation of the United States or to influence the policy or\naffect the conduct of the U.S. Government by coercion.'' In the\ncase of a cyber attack, however, it may be difficult to even\nidentify perpetrators, let alone define what their intent might\nbe.\nQ.2. Often TRIA is discussed with large cities in mind, but\nmany smaller communities can be targets of terrorist\nactivities. This is shown with the Charleston, South Carolina,\nchurch shooting when a white supremacist murdered nine people.\nSmall communities like this are likely to receive insurance\nfrom local agents.\nAlso, Alabama is home to two extremely popular football\nteams, University of Alabama and Auburn University. The Iron\nBowl is an annual game between Alabama and Auburn and draws\nlarge crowds from each school. This could easily be a target\nfor terrorist organizations.\nHow would reforms to TRIA affect smaller communities,\nparticularly their premiums and the extent of their coverage?\nA.2. The TRIA program does not contain differential application\nprocesses or metrics for different-sized communities. However,\nthe thresholds in the Act (i.e., the program trigger, the\ninsurer deductible, and the $5 million loss threshold for\ncertification) may have a differential effect simply due to the\ncost differences between larger and smaller cities. For\nexample, an identical building is much more expensive to build\nin Manhattan than Mobile, thus, an otherwise identical\nterrorist attack will likely cause lower insured damages and be\nless likely to clear the thresholds for TRIA coverage. Thus, if\nthe TRIA dollar thresholds are raised, this would have in\nrelative terms, a larger effect on these less expensive\ncommunities as TRIA coverage would be less likely to be\ntriggered. In practical terms, however, the impact on premiums\nwill be somewhat reduced as the overall cost of insurance in\nsuch communities is lower and the risk of a terrorist attack,\nand thus the premiums for terrorism insurance, is seen as\nlower.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SINEMA FROM BAIRD\nWEBEL\nQ.1. In December 2016, the Department of the Treasury issued\nguidance which clarified that losses from cyber-terrorist\nattacks were to be treated the same as commercial property and\ncasualty losses. Do you think this guidance sufficiently covers\nall forms of cyber attacks?\nA.1. The Treasury guidance does not overrule the statutory\nlanguage that is in place, particularly the exemption of\nspecific lines of insurance from the TRIA program. In 2016, the\nState insurance regulators introduced a new cyber liability\nline of insurance for regulatory purposes. Prior to this,\npolicies covering cyber risk were reported in different lines\nof insurance, including in some cases lines of insurance that\nwere specifically exempted from TRIA. This new cyber liability\nline of insurance largely prompted the Treasury guidance. It is\nnot clear whether some of the coverage for cyber risk is still\nbeing covered under an exempted line, but to the extent that\ndamage from a cyber attack still is covered under these\nexempted lines, TRIA would not cover such an attack. This may\nvery well have less of an impact over time as more future cyber\ncoverage likely will be provided under the cyber-specific line\nof insurance that is being covered under TRIA.\nThe guidance also does not affect all of the other\nstatutory aspects of the program, such as the certification\nrequirements and the various monetary thresholds. To the extent\nthat a cyber-terrorist attack might interact differently with\nthese statutory requirements compared to a noncyber attack,\\1\\\nTreasury would be limited in its ability to provide coverage\nunder TRIA for such an attack as any guidance cannot contradict\nthe statute upon which it is based.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ For example, it seems more likely that a cyber attack might be\ncarried out without immediate attribution to the perpetrating party,\nthus making it difficult to discern the motive that is necessary for\ncertification.\nQ.2. How do insurers effectively measure and quantify loss from\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\ncyber attacks?\nA.2. Measuring and quantifying loss from cyber attacks is\ndifficult and the insurance coverage for such attacks is still\nimmature compared to more established lines of insurance where\nthe industry might have decades, or even centuries, of data to\ndraw upon. The insurance rating agency AM Best describes the\nsituation as follows:\nCyber risk modeling is still in its infancy, as events\nand threat vectors are still evolving. To simulate the\nevent sets and fit them into traditional statistical\ndistribution forms is the first challenge. Cataloging\nthe exposure in an insurer's portfolio to these events\nand how the losses vary depending on the severity of\nthe attack and estimating the financial damage are all\ncomplicated problems that cyber modeling firms are\ntackling. These models are improving and may provide\ndirectional input into relative rankings of risk but\nneed to be complimented with stress testing and\nanalytical, experience-based judgment for pricing,\ncapital consumption, and allocation.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\2\\ AM Best, ``Cyber Insurers Are Profitable Today, but Wary of\nTomorrow's Risks,'' June 17, 2019, p. 11.\nA frequent insurer response to the uncertainty reportedly has\nbeen to use certain policy provisions, such as exclusions and\nlimits as well as reinsurance purchases to reduce exposure to\nlarge losses.\\3\\ Policy provisions such as exclusions and\nlimits tend to reduce the utility of cyber insurance to\nconsumers and may lead to consumer confusion.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\3\\ See ``Data Deficit Remains Key Challenge for Cyber Insurance\nUnderwriters,'' Insurance Journal, June 18, 2019, at https://\nwww.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2019/06/18/529663.htm.\n\\4\\ See ``Businesses Believe Cyber Insurance Covers More Than It\nDoes: Survey,'' Insurance Journal, July 31, 2019, at https://\nwww.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2019/07/31/534394.htm.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional Material Supplied for the Record\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]",

Marco Rubio,\nChairman of the Committee, presiding.\nPresent: Senators Rubio, Risch, Scott, Ernst, Young,\nRomney, Hawley, Cardin, Cantwell, and Hirono.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARCO RUBIO, CHAIRMAN, A U.S. SENATOR\nFROM FLORIDA\nChairman Rubio. Today's hearing on the Senate Committee on\nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship will come to order. Thank\nyou for your patience. We have six votes and we made a wise\ndecision, I believe, the Ranking Member and I, that it would be\nbetter to just ride through the six than to try to do the back-\nand-forth, and I think we probably saved time in the long run.\nSo I want to thank you for being here and for your patience.\nFor small businesses and entrepreneurs around the country,\nsecuring a contract with the Federal Government can mean\ninstant growth in the marketplace. In 2018, the Federal\nGovernment obligated $560 billion in contracts for goods,\nservices, research, and development. More than $100 billion of\nthat total went to small business contractors.\nThe Contracting Office at the SBA administers several\ntargeted programs, authorized by Congress, that seeks to help\nentrepreneurs access these procurement opportunities with the\nFederal Government, a Federal Government, by the way, which is\nrequired to spend 23 percent of all Federal contracting dollars\nwith small businesses.\nThe four primary programs which are the focus of today's\nhearing provide participants with access to compete within a\nsmaller pool of contracts that are set aside for small\nbusinesses. The first, the Small Business and Capital Ownership\nDevelopment Program, which is commonly referred to as 8(a)\nbecause of its location within the Small Business Act, also\nprovides small businesses with procurement training, technical\nassistance, and the ability to be paired with a mentor\nbusiness.\nIn addition to the classic small businesses that\nparticipate in this program, for up to nine years before they\ngraduate out, 8(a) also gives businesses that are communally\nowned, by Alaska Native corporations, Native Hawaiian\norganizations, Indian tribes, or community development\ncorporations the ability to participate in the program\nindefinitely.\nThe Historically Underutilized Business Zone program, or\nHUBZone, which works to stimulate economic development and\ncreate jobs in the areas of the country that need it the most,\nwas created in 1997. The program uses set-aside contracts and a\nprice preference to bring opportunity to distressed inner\ncities and rural communities where joblessness is often\nrampant.\nThe Women-Owned Small Business Program and Service-Disabled\nVeteran-Owned Small Business Program give two very important\nsmall business groups the chance to compete for set-aside\ncontracts.\nIn addition to the government-wide goal of awarding 23\npercent of contracts to small businesses, Congress has set\ngoals of 5 percent each for 8(a) and women-owned businesses,\nand 3 percent for service-disabled veteran-owned small\nbusinesses and HUBZone-certified businesses.\nThe Federal Government, by the way, could easily exceed\nthese goals if small businesses were given more guidance on the\ndifficult and complex world of Federal procurement, and if\nagency contracting specialists were better informed on how to\nmake compliant set-aside and sole-source awards to small\nbusinesses.\nUnfortunately, as a result of fraud across the board in the\nSBA programs, as reported from multiple government\naccountability office investigations, businesses that do not\nqualify, or should not be qualifying for these specific\ncategory programs are often taking the contracts that are\nintended for these groups.\nFor example, a 2018 audit by the Office of Inspector\nGeneral looked at 56 sole-source awards made to firms in the\nWomen-Owned Small Business Program and it found that 18\ncontracts, valued at $11.7 million, were awarded to firms that\nhad no documentation; 32 contracts, valued at $40.5 million,\nwere awarded to firms with incomplete documentation; and 50\ncontracts, valued at $52.2 million, were not awarded in\ncompliance with Federal regulations. The 2019 GAO study of this\nprogram showed that the SBA still had not developed a process\nto identify when ineligible awards were made under this\nprogram.\nToo many agency contracting officers also do not know how\nto work with the contracting programs. A 2018 GAO study found\nthe SBA's procurement scorecard to assess agency compliance\nwith small business contracting was not effectively measuring\nagency performance or promoting opportunities for small\nbusinesses.\nThe facts are simple. The small businesses' contracting\ngoals are aspirational and unenforceable, so if we do not make\ncontracting with small businesses easy for Federal agencies it\nis not going to happen. The SBA should be an ally for small\nbusiness contractors, not an additional and frustrating hurdle\nto overcome. The disparities amongst the prime contracting\nprograms have made it difficult for small businesses to even\nknow where to start. Each program is an entirely different\nsystem, even for the initial certification process, not to\nmention the different forms of training, types of awards, award\namounts, price preferences that are made available to each\ngroup.\nIn 2015, Congress passed a law requiring that the SBA set\nup a certification process for the then self-certified Women-\nOwned Small Business Program. Unfortunately, four years later,\nthe SBA has yet to comply with that law. In 2018, Congress\npassed a law to measure a business revenue for five years,\ninstead of three, when determining if that business is small\nand if they can compete for set-aside contracts. But the SBA\nhas frankly refused to comply with that law.\nWhile the prime contracting programs are the most well-\nknown parts of the SBA Contracting Office, the subcontracting\nprogram is increasingly important, as the government moves\ntowards consolidated purchasing and larger, multi-award\ncontracts.\nIt is important that we find ways for small businesses to\ncontinue to work with the government, even as the government is\nchanging its purchasing habits to rightfully use taxpayer money\nmore efficiently. Innovations and unique solutions from small\nbusinesses in the private sector help to support our soldiers,\nprotect our national security, enhance government operations,\nand make the Federal bureaucracy more efficient.\nTo keep this contracting cycle going we must reduce fraud,\nstreamlining the Contracting Office at the SBA, and provide\nmore opportunities for small businesses to grow and prosper,\nand I look forward to discussing ways to accomplish these goals\ntoday.\nWith that I turn it over to you, the Ranking Member.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN, RANKING MEMBER, A\nU.S. SENATOR FROM MARYLAND\nSenator Cardin. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman,\nand I thank you for convening this hearing. This is our sixth\nhearing on the reauthorization of the Small Business Act, and\ntoday we will focus on the contracting programs with SBA that\nhelp level the playing field for starkly disadvantaged business\nowners. These programs include the 8(a) Business Development\nProgram, the Women-Owned Small Business Program, Service-\nDisabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Program, and the\nHistorically Underutilized Business Zones, HUBZones, program.\nThe motivation behind my commitment to ensuring a fair\nFederal contracting process is twofold. First, the Federal\nGovernment is the largest consumer of goods and services on the\nplanet, and Federal contracting is a vital part of the economy\nin my home State of Maryland. In fact, Federal Government\ncontracting spending accounts for about 8 percent of Maryland's\nannual GDP, and supports thousands of jobs that help the\nfamilies and bolster the middle class.\nSecond, Congress passed the Small Business Act to ensure\nthe preservation and expansion of opportunities for small\nbusinesses because doing so is basic not only to the economic\nwell-being but the security of our country. Those words were\ntrue 65 years ago when the law was passed and it is even more\ntrue today.\nThe Small Business Act sets a goal for Federal Government\nto spend 23 percent of all contracting dollars with small\nbusinesses. While I am pleased that we are meeting this goal, I\nam troubled that the data shows that we have a shrinking base\nof contractors rather than an expanding base of contractors. A\nrecent report by Bloomberg Government found that the number of\nFederal contractors working on unclassified, prime contracts is\nat a 10-year low, despite a steady rise in government contract\nspending over the same period.\nThis means that while contracts are getting bigger and\nbigger, we are creating an insular club with fewer and fewer\nbusinesses successfully competing for government contracts,\ncreating a less-competitive marketplace and reducing\nopportunities in the process, and that is contrary to what\nthese set-asides and programs are all about, and that is\nencouraging new small businesses that can bring innovation and\njob growth to our economy and help our Nation.\nThis trend is being driven by the largest agency. Since\nfiscal year 2009, the number of companies working on contracts\nwith the Department of Defense has declined by 24,000.\nSimilarly, the General Services Administration has seen an\n8,000-company decline. The Department of Veterans Affairs and\nInterior are both contracted with 13,600 fewer companies. These\nare very troubling figures. Predictably, our Nation's small\nbusinesses are bearing the brunt of this decline. According to\nthe same Bloomberg report, the Federal Government did business\nwith 32 percent fewer small vendors in fiscal year 2018 than it\ndid in fiscal year 2009. For comparison, the number of large\nvendors fell by only 4 percent.\nThis trend is a cause of great concern in my home State of\nMaryland, where the Federal Government spent $33 billion in\nFederal contract dollars in fiscal year 2018, including $11\nbillion to small businesses. We want to create contracting\nwhere small, innovative businesses are encouraged, not shut\nout.\nSo today I am looking forward to speaking with our\nwitnesses from SBA and GAO about how we can improve\nopportunities for our Nation's small businesses to contract\nwith the Federal Government. I am also looking forward to\nhearing from small business owners here today about the support\nthey need from the Federal Government to remain competitive and\ncompete in the marketplace.\nI want to thank all of our witnesses for joining us and I\nlook forward to hearing your testimony and innovative ideas for\nimproving the SBA contracting programs and the Federal\nGovernment small business contracting procedures.\nChairman Rubio. All right. We will move to our first panel.\nRobb Wong is the Associate Administrator of the Office of\nGovernment Contracting and Business Development at the SBA, and\nMr. William Shear is the Director of Financial Markets and\nCommunity Investment at the U.S. Government Accountability\nOffice.\nMr. Wong, thank you for being here. We will start with you.\nSTATEMENT OF ROBB WONG, ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR, OFFICE OF\nGOVERNMENT CONTRACTING AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, U.S. SMALL\nBUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, WASHINGTON, DC\nMr. Wong. Good afternoon, and thank you for the opportunity\nto testify and talk about the contracting and business\ndevelopment programs provided by SBA.\nSince March 2017, I have served as the Associate\nAdministrator for the Office of Government Contracting and\nBusiness Development. This is my second time at SBA, previously\nhaving worked before in the agency's Office of General Counsel,\nwhere I wrote many of the rules and regulations in the previous\nstate.\nIn my current role, I administer programs and services that\nassist small businesses in meeting the requirements to receive\ngovernment contracts. The Federal Government spends nearly $500\nbillion a year on goods and services through contracting, and\nthere are government-wide goals for awards to small businesses\nthat the SBA helps to foster and support.\nSince rejoining the agency over two years ago, my focus has\nbeen on Federal contracting officers across the Federal\nGovernment, and my goal has been simple--to make SBA-certified\ncompanies a better option for the contracting officer so that\nthey will increase the supply of government contracts to small\nbusiness.\nWe have looked at barriers that contracting officers may\nface in hitting their percentage goals. We want to grow the\necosystems by increasing the number of companies in that\nsystem, and we want to improve the quality of contracts. Again,\nit will help the contract officer to continue to award\ncontracts to small business.\nAs a foundation, SBA established and continues to refine\nour online platform, Certify.gov. Working with our CIO, Maria\nRoat, we brought the governance of the platform in-house. Our\nnext steps are to improve its functionality and interactivity,\nnot only for the public but also for our SBA analysts and\nstaff. This should help create a reliable tool to support the\ntransition of the women-owned small business certifications as\nwell as for any future considerations with certifying service-\ndisabled veteran-owned small businesses.\nRight now, the agency certifies over 10,000 companies in\nour 8(a) and HUBZone programs. The woman-owned and service-\ndisabled certifications total over 20,000. Adding that amount\nof volume and responsibility to our existing staff, without\nadditional funding, is something the agency continues to\nwrestle with.\nAdding to these challenges are aspects of the self-\ncertification process that my GAO colleague, Mr. Shear, has\nhighlighted. We have also been testing a unified application\nprocess to help standardize the way that the public applies and\nalso how SBA reviews both eligibility and continuing\neligibility. All of this must occur before we add the volume of\nnew cases from the WOSB Program, Women-Owned Small Business\nProgram. Excuse me.\nNext, let me update you on an issue that I know is of\ninterest to the members of the Committee. In late December, SBA\nreleased an information notice to stakeholders regarding the\nRunway Extension Act. Since then, we have worked to develop a\nrule which was sent to the Federal Register on Monday. When\npublished, this will further advise stakeholders and will begin\na public comment period to receive their input.\nI wanted to close by mentioning a few items that our\nprogram office continues to assess and that might lead to\nfurther discussion with the Committee.\nWe continue to look at the Federal appropriations cycle and\nany effect it may have on contracting officers. We continue to\nreview category management and whether it is hurting contract\navailability. We also continue to assess sole-source thresholds\nand whether they need to be adjusted.\nI connect these items back to my main goal, to help the\ncontracting officers and to make small businesses a better\noption for them. In my view, these items impair the\ngovernment's mission, as well as those people who help to\naccomplish it. These are all important factors in keeping small\nbusinesses in our Federal contracting programs, as every time a\nsmall business drops out it hurts our industrial base.\nThank you again for the opportunity to testify, and I look\nforward to working with you.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Wong follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nChairman Rubio. Thank you. Mr. Shear.\nSTATEMENT OF WILLIAM SHEAR, DIRECTOR, FINANCIAL MARKETS AND\nCOMMUNITY INVESTMENT, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE,\nWASHINGTON, DC\nMr. Shear. Chairman Rubio, Ranking Member Cardin, and\nmembers of the Committee, I am pleased to be here this\nafternoon to discuss our recent work on SBA's contracting\nprograms and SBA's progress in implementing our\nrecommendations.\nMy testimony today is based primarily on three reports we\nissued between September 2018 and March 2019, and also a report\nwe issued in October of 2014. I will discuss SBA's progress on\nimplementing our prior recommendations on first, its women's\nprocurement program, second, its HUBZone program in Puerto\nRico, and third, SBA's Procurement Scorecard. In the interest\nof time, I will largely focus on our work on the women's\nprocurement program in my oral statement.\nSBA has not fully addressed deficiencies we have previously\nidentified for the women's procurement program, and these\ndeficiencies are affected by SBA's ongoing implementation of\nchanges to the program authorized by the National Defense\nAuthorization Act of 2015. SBA implemented one of the three\nchanges to the program authorized in the 2015 NDAA when it\npublished a final rule to implement sole-source authority,\nwhich became effective October 2015. The two other changes,\nauthorizing SBA to implement its own certification process, and\nrequiring SBA to eliminate the option for firms to self-certify\nthat they are eligible for the program, have not been\nimplemented.\nIn addition, SBA has not fully addressed program oversight\ndeficiencies described in our March 2019 report, and first\nidentified in our October 2014 report. We recommended that SBA\nestablish comprehensive procedures to monitor and assess the\nperformance of the third-party certifiers in accordance with\ntheir agreements with SBA and program regulations.\nSBA conducted a compliance review of certifiers in 2016,\nbut SBA officials said, in June 2018, that SBA had no plans to\nconduct further compliance reviews until the final rule\nimplementing the new certification process was completed. SBA\nalso has not fully addressed deficiencies related to\neligibility exams. The exams identified high rates of\npotentially ineligible businesses. SBA does not collect\nreliable information on the results of its annual eligibility\nexams and continues to have no mechanism to look across exams\nfor common eligibility issues to inform the program.\nWith respect to SBA's HUBZone program, we have a large body\nof work over a period of time addressing the program. In our\nSeptember 2018 report, that focused on Puerto Rico, we\nidentified internal control deficiencies related to the\ncertification and recertification process that were generally\nconsistent with the deficiencies identified in previous work.\nWe are awaiting documentation from SBA related to the agency's\nplanned changes to the certification and recertification\nprocess.\nFinally, SBA has taken some steps to address recommendation\nof our September 2018 report about its Procurement Scorecard.\nSBA made revisions to address requirements specified in the\nNDAA for fiscal year 2016. Among other actions in response to\nour recommendations, SBA has proposed a two-phase program\nevaluation of the scorecard.\nPhase 1 would include a report to Congress, planned to be\nissued in September 2019, on the impact of the small business\nprocurement goal program for Chief Financial Officers Act\nagencies and to provide a recommendation on continuing,\nmodifying, expanding, or terminating the scorecard program. In\nPhase 2, SBA plans to conduct a program evaluation that\ninvestigates the effectiveness of the Small Business\nContracting Scorecard on Federal agencies, small business\ncontracting goal achievement.\nChairman Rubio, Ranking Member Cardin, and members of the\nCommittee, this completes my prepared statement. I look forward\nto your questions.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Shear follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nChairman Rubio. Thank you. I will just start with--in the\ninterest of time and for our members that have other places as\nwell, because we started late, so I am just going to ask two\nquestions and they are related.\nMr. Wong, in 2015, Congress passed that law requiring the\nSBA to set up the certification program for the Women-Owned\nSmall Business Programs. It has been four years. They have yet\nto comply. What authority does the SBA have not to comply with\nlaw, and why has it not complied?\nMr. Wong. The answer to your first question, we do not have\nthat authority to not comply, and the reason that we have not\ncomplied was certainly brought to my attention, and it is\nsomething I have worked on since the first month that I have\nbeen here. I am a lawyer by trade, so being out of compliance\nwith the law is absolutely unacceptable.\nThe challenge we have had, sir, is basically this. We have\nan ecosystem that we have looked at, that we have certain\nresponsibilities with our certifications to make sure that the\nright companies get into our program that are qualified, but\nthen we also have to make sure, before they get a contract, we\nhold the public trust to make sure that anyone who is awarded a\ncontract with an SBA certification is actually eligible to\nreceive it. Then we have to make the process easier to make\nsure that we can help the contracting officer with the supply\nof contracts.\nAs you noted in your statement earlier, we are dealing with\na system where we had, for 8(a) and for HUBZone, and then\npotentially WOSB--excuse me, Women-Owned Small Businesses--we\nhad three different silos. So literally what happened was if\nyou--we--if you gave the element of ownership to three\ndifferent people, they had three different systems on how to\nevaluate this program. That is unacceptable as well.\nSo when we were looking at WOSB, one of the first things I\nlooked at was I realized that when I looked at the volume of\napplications we had and the number of existing companies that\nwe had, we realized that we had three times the volume for the\npotential WOSB program that we had for any of our other\nprograms, particular the 8(a) program, which has been around\nfor 30 years.\nChairman Rubio. Just on this topic, I know you have been\nthere a month so you are trying to comply now. Correct?\nMr. Wong. Yes. Absolutely.\nChairman Rubio. Do you have any explanation? In the month\nthat you have been there, have you discovered why nothing has\nhappened in the last four years?\nMr. Wong. Yes. So--and just to clarify, I have been here a\nlittle bit over two years, but within one month of me being\nthere, two years ago, I tried to get a handle on what was going\non.\nThe short version of what we are trying to do is we should\nbe processing all of our applications the same way, to the\nextent possible. So what we have done is we have re-engineered\nall of these processes to match. In short, we have 8(a), which\nis our historically best program. We broke that down into\nelements of eligibility, which there are 11. Then we realized\nwith HUBZone there are six. And then we even went into each\nelement of eligibility and we determined the process of how you\nactually determine if someone is qualified under each----\nChairman Rubio. What I am just trying to wrap my mind\naround----\nMr. Wong. Yes, sir.\nChairman Rubio [continuing]. You have been there two years.\nWithin a month of getting there you started looking at this.\nMr. Wong. Yes.\nChairman Rubio. You have now been there for over two\nyears----\nMr. Wong. Yes.\nChairman Rubio [continuing]. And you are still going\nthrough this process of trying to organize it so you can\naddress it.\nMr. Wong. Yes. Originally, what we had done was we had come\nback to Congress----\nChairman Rubio. It does not take two years to do that, and\nit has not yet happened.\nMr. Wong. Yes, because we had to try three times now to\ncome up with a solution that we thought would be palatable for\nCongress. Yes, sir.\nChairman Rubio. Okay. Well, let me--Mr. Shear, let me ask\nyou. You have seen--well, the--they failed to implement the\nmandates from the 2015 NDAA on the Women-Owned Small Business\nProgram. Will the new proposed rule really fix the\ncertification program?\nMr. Shear. A new rule, whether the one proposed or another\nrule, is not going to fix the problem. The question is how does\nSBA implement this? We have seen a situation where SBA is not\nvigilant on either overseeing third-party certifiers or of\ncollecting accurate information when there are businesses that\ndo not seem to be eligible participating in the program, and\nfollowing up and looking for the underlying reasons.\nWe have made recommendations to SBA in a self-certified\nenvironment that we think not only are relevant for the self-\ncertified environment but the environment that would be created\nby a new certification process. We also think that our\nrecommendations would help inform that process.\nSo our concern----\nChairman Rubio. Are those recommendations reflected in the\nproposed rule?\nMr. Shear. In the proposed rule, the proposed rule which I\ndo not want to get into, third-party certifiers versus the use\nof SBA on its own, but what they all have in common is that\nthere is a lack of understanding and a lack of focus, like on\nfollowing up.\nIn 2016, there was a review of third-party certifiers,\nwhich not only could inform what job are they doing but could\nhelp inform what makes for good certification process. They had\na recommendation having to do with eligibility exams, where\nthey seemed to be starting, in 2016, to start looking at the\nunderlying causes. But both of those seem to have been\nsuspended for a rulemaking and we really cannot understand why.\nAnd it is also a mystery to us, just as I think it is\nsomething that you raised, which is a very good point. Why has\nit taken so long to--you know, without getting into the merits\nof the proposed rule, why has it taken so long to get this\nproposed rule out? We really do not understand. When we first\nasked for a timeline, a project plan for how they were going to\nget from A to B, they have never been able to produce that. So\nthat raises another concern for us.\nChairman Rubio. Well, the concern that I have is all those\nwomen-owned small businesses that should have qualified and\ncould have qualified but were bumped out of the queue by the\nones that should not have, because of the inaction that has\ntaken so long to get even to this point.\nRanking Member.\nSenator Cardin. Quite frankly, this is not acceptable. We\nhave a certification process right now for the 8(a) program and\nHUBZone, so it is not like SBA does not know how to do\ncertifications. It is hard for us to understand why the women-\nowned small businesses have not progressed. So do we have a\ntarget date when we are going to--when you are going to be able\nto give us something specific on this, when that date is?\nMr. Wong. The target--it should be contemporaneous with the\nWOSB rule. I misstated this in the hearing we had a couple of\nweeks ago, as 2021, but it should be contemporaneous with the\nrule in July 1st of 2020.\nSenator Cardin. Okay. So it will be another year.\nMr. Wong. Yes, but that--the rule is about as far as we can\npush it, but we want to make sure. What I have told our staff\nis we need to make sure that----\nSenator Cardin. That is not really--that is not acceptable.\nSo we will look at what we can do to--you know, it is\nchallenging for us. We passed a statute and we expect it to be\nimplemented.\nMr. Wong. I agree.\nSenator Cardin. And I think what the Chairman said is\nabsolutely accurate. These are extremely important programs. We\nwant to make sure that qualified companies can benefit from it.\nI think we all agree that SBA certification is where we need to\nbe----\nMr. Wong. Yes.\nSenator Cardin [continuing]. And we are not there. So it\nis--it remains a matter of frustration.\nWe will look at whether we cannot give you a little bit\nmore directive way to speed this up. I understand rulemaking\ntakes time. Believe me I do. But this is unacceptable.\nI want to get to the point in my opening statement on the\nnumber of small businesses and the decline in the number of\nsmall businesses participating, and talk a little bit about why\nwe do not have a larger supply base, why SBA has not encouraged\nthat. We have category management, as I understand it, on\nprocurement, which aims at larger contracts, which is a\ndisadvantage for small companies, particularly if their only\nentry is through subcontracting.\nSo what strategies can be deployed to get new small\ncompanies involved in government procurement to counter the\ntrends that we have seen over the last several years?\nMr. Wong. In my opinion, sir, there are two things that we\ncould do. If we could exempt small business programs from\ncategory management--if you look at what we do, we represent\nthe underserved. We represent 23 percent. We fight every year\nto make 23 percent.\nSenator Cardin. I am sorry. I was listening. I was just\ntelling my staff to--whether you need legislative authority to\nexempt from category management?\nMr. Wong. Probably.\nSenator Cardin. Well, why don't we find out whether you\nneed statutory authority or whether you can do that\nadministratively.\nMr. Wong. Even still, the specter of category management I\nthink is a good idea. Efficiency is always important. However,\nthe way that it is being applied now to small businesses has a\ndeleterious effect. The MAC report that came out even proves\nthat we are losing small businesses on both ends for two\ndifferent reasons, in my opinion.\nWhat happens is that we just have, even as recently as last\nFriday, we get calls from small businesses, for example, in our\n8(a) program. With our 8(a) program you get a certification,\nbut we tell you that you have to do your own marketing and that\nwill determine the success of your own business. Well, we have\npeople that are relying on that and they are working really\nhard, and they win these contracts, and they win these large\ncontracts and then they call us and they say, ``The government\nis taking our contract away, putting it into a category\nmanagement vehicle, and we do not qualify for that vehicle. So\nwe worked hard to get this exactly like you said and now you\ntook it away from us.''\nAnd for the small businesses, a lot of small businesses--\nand I have been a small business owner for 20 years before\nthis, and I have worked with is industry for at least 30 years.\nThey do not have lots of contracts to replace that with, and\noften if that is their mainstay contract they lose faith in the\nprogram, they lose faith in government contracting, so they\nquit. So we lose people from----\nSenator Cardin. I understand what you are saying. I might\nalso say the Army Futures Command in procurement also raises an\nissue whether that is going to be another hurdle that works to\nthe disadvantage of small companies. I want to explore the\nexemption issues that you are talking about, because I think\nthat does not make some sense.\nI also would hope that we could work on reporting\ninformation on prime and subcontracting so that we have a\nbetter understanding of how we can get direct business for\nsmaller companies rather than having to work as prime\ncontractors.\nMr. Wong. Absolutely.\nSenator Cardin. And one last point, and that is the Small\nBusiness Roadway Extension Act. You mentioned that a rule is\nbeing promulgated, I think today or yesterday, in your\ntestimony. That is already late. I would urge you to make sure\nthat is implemented as quickly as you are able to do it. It\ndoes not seem that complicated, quite frankly, and we want to\nmake sure that the intent of our statute is carried out.\nMr. Wong. Yes, sir. You know, two--may I address that\nissue?\nChairman Rubio. Yes.\nMr. Wong. Okay. So I also talk to people in Maryland. I\nlive in Maryland.\nSenator Cardin. If I knew that ahead of time I would not\nhave given you a hard time.\n[Laughter.]\nMr. Wong. I had an Asian dad, sir. That is not hard. It is\nokay.\nBut, sir, here is what happened. When we got the Runway\nExtension Act, okay, we understood what the intent was with\nCongress. And I tried to be helpful, I tried to be proactive,\nand I said, you know, we took a look at it, and what happened\nwas we got calls from people, and here is what was interesting.\nWe got calls from small businesses that this would help. It\nsays if we can count five years instead of three years, we can\nstill remain small. What is surprising is that we also got\ncalls that said, if this is active now, we have had some bad\nyears, so if we include five years it will actually hurt us.\nSo between the program office and between the attorneys, we\ntook a look at it, and we determined that the question about\nwhether or not--which contracts would be affected, was a\nlegitimate question. And so we decided that despite--instead of\nwaiting we would do what we could do, as much as we could do.\nSo we started with rulemaking to make sure that the intent of\nthe Runway Extension Act, to affect the small business programs\nat our agency and every agency, was affected. The most power\nthat we had, though, was to do it through a rule, and we have\ndone that as quickly as possible. That one should be commencing\naround January of 2020.\nWe also understand that there is another track that\nCongress is taking, but at the end of the day we are both\ntrying as quickly as we can to make sure that Congress' intent\nwas fulfilled. We tried to do it collaboratively and\ncooperatively, as quickly as we could.\nSenator Cardin. Thank you.\nChairman Rubio. Senator Ernst.\nSenator Ernst. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you to\nthe witnesses for being here today.\nThe SBA's contracting programs role in ensuring small\nbusinesses have opportunities to compete as Federal contractors\nis of significant importance, and I will address some of the\nissues I am really concerned about. I am glad that we have an\nopportunity to discuss ways to improve these programs, so\nagain, thank you for being here.\nAnd, Mr. Wong, I will start with you. In March, Senator\nTammy Duckworth and I introduced a bill called the Expanding\nContracting Opportunities for Small Businesses Act, and it\neliminates a discrepancy that puts women and service-disabled\nveterans who own small businesses at a disadvantage when\ncompeting for contracts by setting the contract manufacturing\nthreshold at $7 million for businesses certified under each\nprogram.\nCan you speak to the impact that you think this would have\nand what further steps we could do to support women and\nveteran-owned small businesses? Any ideas that you have would\nbe welcomed.\nMr. Wong. So I will caveat that the suggestions that I have\nare my own, having been a small business owner.\nWhat I would suggest is the 8(a) program, if you look at\nthis, this has been the backbone of our agency and it has been\nthe favorite contract vehicle of contracting officers for\nyears, particularly if you look at things where we have been\noperating in an environment where we work with continued\nresolutions.\nSenator Ernst. Right.\nMr. Wong. I talk to everyone as much as we can. And if you\nlook at, sometimes, a lot of these agencies, they have 55\npercent of their spending is done after April, in some of these\nyears. That is not enough time to run competitions, okay? So\nthat is why 8(a) is such a great vehicle. If we want to spur\nmore small business growth into this ecosystem, my suggestion\nwould be this, several things. First and foremost, we fix\nHUBZone, which we are trying to do, because I think that\nprogram could be just as powerful as 8(a). Next, what I think\nwe should do--the suggestion would be is to increase the\ncapacity or increase the thresholds. Because of category\nmanagement and consolidation you are getting larger contracts\nand more complex contracts. The problem is that the thresholds\nhave been set 20 years ago, in 1990. They have been set a while\nago, and that might be more than 20.\nSo the problem is that, you know, the joke that I say to\npeople is what do you have that is 30 years old today, other\nthan your spouse, that is just as good today as it was 30 years\nago? Well, we need to update the SBA limits for 2019 and\nbeyond, particularly because we have things like category\nmanagement, which is compressing things.\nSo right now, as an example, if you look at the way current\nthresholds work, we have a limit on a basic 8(a) company of $4\nmillion, divided by the number of option years. Four million\ndivided by 5, people tell me, is $800,000 a year. Right now,\nthough, the basic contracts, for a contracting officer, that is\nnot very much help to a contracting officer. That becomes like\nif they have a big pile of sand, of trying to get it off the\ndesk with a teaspoon.\nI want to turn that teaspoon into a shovel, and the way we\ndo that, to--you know, at the end of the day, if we fix that\nfor the contracting officer, they are the guardians of the\nsupply of government contracts. If you can increase the\ncapacity at which--or the thresholds at which these sole-source\nawards are awarded, the government contracting officer will\nlove that. I have learned that anecdotally through\nconversations with them.\nSo finally what we do, if we can exempt category\nmanagement--or small business from category management, here is\nanother thing. If you take the added capacity, now, if you look\nat what is going into category management, these are all large\ncontracts. They are over $1 million. But if you give the\ncapacity to the contracting officer, with up to $4 million a\nyear, as an example, for each of the 8(a)s, the government\ncontracting officer has two weapons in its arsenal. They can\nmake that award, they can allow the small business to\nparticipate because a lot of the contracting officers like\nthose contracts. So when those contracts are removed into\ncategory management we have many disappointed parties.\nSo if you increase the threshold for that, the government\ncan keep those contracts working with small businesses, and\neven with--we have worked with OMB, or OFPP. They have a\ndirective on category management. They kept something in there\nin footnote 31 that says meeting a small business goal is\njustification not to use category management. So if we can do\nthat.\nAnd the final thing that I personally would recommend is\nthat we give the contracting officer, and say to him or her\nthat if you have missed one of your socioeconomic goals in the\nprevious year, SBA will temporarily give you 8(a)-like sole-\nsource direct authority for every socioeconomic category you\nhave missed. And I think that what that will do is that will\nkeep--excuse me. Last important thing, sorry. As long as you\nhit your 8(a) goal first.\nSo what I think that will do, from an ecosystem point of\nview, you are going to have government procurement hitting that\n8(a) goal first. It is still special because it operates\ndifferently than the other programs, but it will also make it\ncapable, and it will make it more attractive for women-owned,\nfor HUBZones, and for service-disabled to use our products. We\nwill bring people into the ecosystem, reward them because they\nhave higher capacity, and it will be able to abut some of the\nproblems that we have with category management.\nIf we remove small businesses from category management, at\nleast temporarily, learn how that works efficiently with the\nother 77 percent. So when you take a large contract from a\nlarge company they have more. But when you take it from a small\nbusiness that only has that, they quit. And even if you are one\nof the lucky ones that gets into category management, for a\nsmall business, you make so much money you size out, and so you\ndo not quit but you have to leave.\nSenator Ernst. Yes, no. I think it is very good and I\nappreciate it. I am sorry. We have gone over time. But it was\nreally great information and I do think we need to look at\nthese for the 8(a)s.\nAnd just a comment that I think there is only one program\nthat actually teaches people how to do government contracting,\nand so that is something that we need to focus on as well, so\nthat we do have more women business owners, more minority\nbusiness owners, more of those service-connected disabled\nveterans that are engaging in this area as well.\nSo thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nMr. Wong. Ma'am, to your point, Stanley Jones, Jr. is in\nthe audience with us. He is responsible for that. He had a\ngreat idea that instead of delivering one-on-one capability to\npeople we are trying to do one-to-all. The directive we are\ntrying to do has become more relevant to the 30 million small\nbusinesses out there. So what we are trying to do is come up\nwith modules that teach all businesses how to identify, pursue,\ncapture, and execute business opportunities, whether it is\ngovernment or not. But that is a great suggestion.\nChairman Rubio. Senator Shaheen.\nSenator Shaheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you\nboth for being here.\nMr. Shear, do you think what Mr. Wong is proposing is a\ngood idea?\nMr. Shear. When it comes to statutory changes we do not\nhave work that provides a basis to comment on those. But let me\ngo to looking at the issue, concerns with category management,\nfor example. Let me start with that.\nSenator Shaheen. Okay. Why don't you start with explaining\nwhat category management is.\nMr. Shear. Thank you. With category management, the idea is\nthat you have aggregation of different types of procurements so\nthat you are limiting the number of businesses that compete. So\nit tends to lead to kind of larger, you know, larger\nprocurements, and this can have an adverse effect on small\nbusinesses.\nSo what I am going to----\nSenator Shaheen. Give me an example.\nMr. Shear. It has been used, for example--I am trying to\nremember what the eagle program is called that GSA had, but it\ncomes down to it can be as simple as providing office products\nper se, that you are limiting the number of firms that can\ncompete to provide through those vehicles. So it can lead to a\nsmaller number of small businesses that might be able to\nparticipate.\nSo let me start with category management, if you can take--\nI am sorry my definition is not more specific than that--but\nlet me take that as an example. We now are initiating, on a\nlarge engagement, looking at category management, including\nimpacts on small businesses, but in doing that we are going to\njump back, as a starting point, what the processor was,\nstrategic sourcing a number of years ago. And what we find,\nwith these types of vehicles, that there are certain provisions\nof the Small Business Act that become even more important in\nensuring that small businesses really have the opportunities\nthey should be having.\nSo, for example, we have the Offices of Small and\nDisadvantaged Business Utilization. We have done work that\nshows many agencies are not in compliance with the requirements\nto make sure that what are called the OSDBUs really have the\nstature in the agency and the roles in the agency that are\nnecessary for them to represent small business interests. And\nwhen we look back at strategic sourcing we saw a definite\ndistinction between agencies where the OSDBUs really had a seat\nat the table and those where they did not.\nSo looking at those Small Business Act provisions through\nthe roles of the OSDBUs, you know, the procurement center\nrepresentatives at SBA, it becomes more important to try to\nidentify how, in this environment, we can still provide\ncontracting opportunities for small businesses. So I wanted to\ndraw attention to that.\nJust on the other thing, on women's procurement and\nservice-disabled veteran-owned small business, SBA has talked\nfor years about trying to bring technology into its oversight\nof the program and technology to try to make these programs\nmore user-friendly for contract officers and for the firms that\nare participating in it. And so we certainly--our\nrecommendations are very much geared toward the idea of\nbringing that type of technology, as far as a solution, to try\nto not only make sure ineligible firms are not participating\nbut that these programs become more accessible for contract\nagencies.\nSenator Shaheen. So is there anybody that you would cite\nwho is doing this well, that either you or Mr. Wong would cite,\nany agencies within the Federal Government that you think are\ndoing a good job?\nMr. Shear. The agency that stands out for me, in terms of\nthe role of the OSDBU director, in terms of identifying, you\nknow, opportunities for set-asides and other things, in this\nenvironment where we have, let's say, strategic sourcing, which\nwe have looked at, and category management we have looked at,\nwould be the Department of Homeland Security.\nSenator Shaheen. And how about with women-owned small\nbusinesses, and what are they doing that makes them stand out?\nHow are they doing a good job?\nMr. Shear. With women-owned small businesses, I think,\nreally, the ball is in SBA's court to come up with a system\nthat contract officers can really use, where the certification\nreally means something that has some confidence for them, that\nthey feel confident in using, you know, women-owned small\nbusiness set-asides.\nSenator Shaheen. So you--neither of you can recommend any\nagency within the Federal Government that is doing a good job\nwith contracting out to women-owned small businesses, that is\nmeeting their--the 5 percent target regularly, that has\npractices in place that you think are good at reaching out to\nthose businesses?\nMr. Wong. I think--I think that there--sorry.\nMr. Shear. No. go ahead.\nMr. Wong. I think that there are several. DHS is certainly\none of those.\nSo I had an opportunity, for example, to talk to Kevin\nBoshears, who is actually retiring next week. Maybe you could\ncall him and tell him not to.\nSenator Shaheen. Um, so----\nMr. Wong. But they do it by looking at every single\nprocurement. They work with their procurement shop to do that.\nIt is to their credit, however, the system that they have is\nvery different than other agencies. And there are other\nagencies that do hit their women target sporadically. I could\nget you a list. I do not have that off the top of my head.\nBut----\nSenator Shaheen. Is there a list posted on the website of\nthe SBA?\nMr. Wong. I do not think that there is a historical one,\nbut I can get you everything that you need.\nSenator Shaheen. Well, I am out of time, but just a follow-\nup. Is the issue having an individual in that position who is\ncommitted to it and who does a good job, or is the issue having\na process in place that actually makes it happen?\nMr. Shear. You have to have an agency that is willing to\ngive the stature to their director. So, I mean, you have two\npeople--you know, you have a director that is involved and you\nhave an agency, but you have certain agencies that have\nfacilitated this more complete role. Now, you know, both of us\nknow Kevin Boshears well. He is one that has been given that\nstature and he has earned that stature, so it goes hand-in-\nhand.\nSenator Shaheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Rubio. Senator Cantwell.\nSenator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you\nfor holding this important hearing on SBA's contracting\nprograms.\nI wanted to ask about an important issue for continuing to\ngive women access to Federal contracts. The current law\nprovides that women-owned businesses must have unconditional\nownership by women of 51 percent interest in their company to\nmaintain that SBA certification. I will just note that the\nFederal Government never met its 5 percent goal until we\nchanged the sole-source contracting element, so when we changed\nthat in 2015, we made our goals. We may have slipped, but I\njust think we have to keep peeling back the issues that are\nprohibiting us. And, obviously, with 50 percent of the society\ncoming up with ideas we definitely want to make sure that they\nare getting access to capital to do so.\nSo one thing I am working with Chairman Rubio on, and I\nappreciate his attention to this and I am happy to work with\nhim on this, is to make sure women-owned businesses can get\nequity investments that they need to grow and still be able to\ncompete for those government contracts. This is an important\naspect of their business and also important for winning\ncontracts.\nSo do either of you have any concern or opposition about\nthat language, making sure that women-owned businesses are not\npenalized from investment from venture capitalists at all?\nMr. Wong. Ma'am, the only challenge we might have is that\ngenerally we--the issue we have that is in the 8(a) program is\na control issue, okay. But assuming that we can make sure that\nthe ownership is there and that the control rests with women-\nowned companies, I have no problem with that. I mean, we are a\ndifferent--you know, when these rules came out, venture capital\nwas not--that was something that only elite companies did. Now\neverybody is doing it.\nSo I think that if we set our minds to it--and this is my\npersonal opinion--that, you know, investment at certain ages is\nalmost a necessary prerequisite, or at least an avenue. At the\nend of the day, I think that investment makes a better company.\nIf they are a better company, they have better quality. If they\nhave better quality, then that goes hand-in-hand, because that\nis how we make awards. We want stronger companies. So I like\nthat idea.\nSenator Cantwell. Okay.\nMr. Shear.\nMr. Shear. We have not done work analyzing that issue to\nopine one way or the other.\nSenator Cantwell. Okay. Well, I thank the Chairman for his\nleadership on this, and I think it just--you know, when we are\nlooking at this issue of why we do not have more success in\nwomen-owned businesses, we have to look at what are the\nstumbling blocks, and I would consider this one of the\nstumbling blocks, and we should just proceed and knock it down,\nand allow women to have more investment and still have these\ngovernment contracts.\nSo thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Rubio. Thanks for the work you have done, and\nthe--fixed the VC investments are a key part. You cannot, in\nthe 21st century, in any century, really, but you cannot really\nprosper as a business if you do not have access to investment,\nwhich is increasingly steering away from small business writ\nlarge, but in particular, among those owned by minorities and\nthose owned by women. So I am grateful for all the work you\nhave put in.\nSenator Hirono. You can use this time, as well, to announce\nour Hawaii party at five today.\nSenator Hirono. Yes. All of you are invited to Hawaii--a\nTaste of Hawaii on the Hill, consisting mainly of small\nbusinesses from Hawaii.\nA lot of us are very supportive of the socioeconomic groups\nthat we want to have awarded these huge--well, not the huge,\nbut their share of government contracts. So with regard to the\nDepartment of Defense, which has a lot of contracts, the so-\ncalled Section 809--this is for Mr. Wong--809 Panel released\nrecommendations to eliminate most small business set-asides at\nthe Department of Defense.\nSo I have heard from small businesses in Hawaii, including\nour Native Hawaiian-owned businesses, who are seriously\nconcerned about what these recommendations, if implemented,\nwould mean for small businesses in the United States. And, of\ncourse, set-asides have been an important tool for Federal\nGovernment departments and agencies like DoD to meet their\nsmall business contracting goals, especially for small,\ndisadvantages businesses, women-owned small businesses,\nservice-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, Native\nHawaiian small businesses, and others.\nSo, Mr. Wong, can you elaborate on the importance of small\nbusiness set-asides for Federal Government departments and\nagencies in meeting their contracting goals?\nMr. Wong. Yes, ma'am, I can. If you want to talk--in terms\nof the--you were talking about the Native programs,\nparticularly in Hawaii----\nSenator Hirono. Well, the concern has been raised by the\nNative Hawaiian-owned businesses because a number of them did\ncontract with the Department of Defense and suddenly that\nnumber has plummeted.\nMr. Wong. We heard about that on Friday. Yep, I absolutely\nagree.\nYour first point, the 809 Panel is certainly an efficient\npanel, but, by the same token, it is diametrically opposed to\nour mission.\nSenator Hirono. Yes.\nMr. Wong. We are all about, and we support the mission of\nmaximum practicable opportunity for small business.\nSenator Hirono. Yes. I share that.\nMr. Wong. Small businesses, by their nature, are not the\nmost efficient, but they are important, and they are important\nto develop--to our industrial base.\nSenator Hirono. Mm-hmm.\nMr. Wong. What I like about the Native companies,\nparticularly the Hawaiian companies as well----\nSenator Hirono. Mm-hmm.\nMr. Wong [continuing]. Is that they are power users with\n8(a). They allow, again, this shovel for a contracting officer\nto help them to deliver the work.\nThe other thing that I think that is noble about the Native\ncompanies is that they have a responsibility that is much\ngreater than just running a small business. You know, as you\nknow, and as we have discussed, they have to take care of past,\npresent, and future generations, and that is a concern that\nalmost no other business in the United States has.\nSenator Hirono. Yes. They have, basically, like a social\npublic good kind of a requirement for them that is not applied\nto any other small business.\nMr. Wong. That is correct. And so I think that when the 809\nPanel, when they are talking about reducing set-asides, I\nabsolutely would not agree with that.\nSenator Hirono. So has SBA voiced their concerns?\nMr. Wong. Absolutely. I went----\nSenator Hirono. And what has been the reaction?\nMr. Wong. So when I first got there I went over with Ken\nDodds, who is also in our audience right now, and when we were\nthere--we went over there, I think, for the third time, and I\nthink it was Mr. Drabkin, who was the head of this, said, ``Mr.\nWong, you look like a nice fellow, but we are not aligned.''\nBut he says that, so--he says, ``That is okay, but our job is\nto make these recommendations.''\nThe 809 Panel, similar to category management, in my\nopinion, has the effect of destroying the industrial base. If\nyou look at SBA, our history, our creation was founded on\nreplenishing and strengthening that industrial base. That is\nwhy our mission of maximum practicable opportunity is there.\nSenator Hirono. And, by the way, you know, I sit on the\nArmed Services Committee, and for so many of our large\ncontractors they need a huge, thousands of people in their\nsupply chain. And if this recommendation by the Section 809\nPanel disrupts that chain and starts to--and if it starts to\nresult in thousands of the people who are in the chain go out\nof business, that is bad----\nMr. Wong. It hurts our country.\nSenator Hirono [continuing]. For our large contractors\nalso. So what can we all do? Can this Committee weigh in? Is\nthere something we can do to say, ``Wait a minute. This is not\nthe way to go, DoD?''\nMr. Wong. If we could work collaboratively, I would love to\nwork collaboratively with you to help raise our voice with the\n809 Panel and with Congress. But I think we should fight this.\nSenator Hirono. I hope that this is something, Mr.\nChairman, that we can pursue.\nSo I do have some other concerns. Yeah, I hear the concerns\nregarding the support for women-owned businesses, because we\nare not hitting our goals. Can you clarify something for me?\nDoes every Federal department have to reach these--the 20\npercent contracting goals? Every department--DoD, Homeland\nSecurity, everybody?\nMr. Wong. So the technical answer is no, but the way I\nwould like to describe it is, if you have a pie that represents\n100, we have to eat 23 percent, and we have to go to each of\nthe agencies, who, if some can eat more in certain portions\nthen they eat more, and we negotiate that with them.\nSenator Hirono. So it would seem that we are not going to\nrequire every department to meet these goals, because some can\nexceed those goals. Why don't we make every department meet\nthese goals?\nMr. Wong. Because I think that for some--depending on how\nyou look at the buys--the short version is that every agency\ndoes not treat--does not buy from the same sources for the\nthings that they need, so we are mindful of that.\nSenator Hirono. Do you think that kind of approach still is\nreasonable now, or have there not been some changes?\nMr. Wong. My personal feeling is that--and I will give you\na lawyer's answer; we are both lawyers--is under the rules that\nwe have we have exceeded that 23 percent for the sixth year in\na row, but more importantly, in terms of number of dollars,\nwhich translate directly into jobs, no matter who gets those\ncontracts, we have increased this market by about 21 percent.\nSo despite the misgivings that we have, we are hitting the\ngoals that we have, but this is also why, when we are talking,\nyou know, one of the things that is inherent to me is that when\nthe government hits a goal and we task somebody specifically in\nthe government to achieve it, they tend to achieve it. And the\nperson and people who are responsible, in this case for\ngovernment contracts, is the contracting officer. They have the\nmost power to do that, because they are the ones that are\ndelegated by their leadership--you have got to hit these goals,\nright?\nSo that is why I am generally saying make it easier for\nthem, using SBA programs, and they will hit that goal.\nSenator Hirono. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for letting me go\nover.\nChairman Rubio. Just as a point of information, I believe\nSenator Duckworth has filed a Sense of the Senate to the NDAA\nbill----\nSenator Hirono. Oh, thank you.\nChairman Rubio [continuing]. That would add--that would\noppose the recommendation to remove the DoD set-aside. I think\nthe Armed Services Committee has a different opinion, so we\nwill see how that plays itself out.\nSenator Romney, you would be next. You just arrived. I\ncan--I am going to buy some time, or--I can ask a question,\nactually.\nSenator Romney. Why don't you go ahead and let me take a--\n--\nChairman Rubio. It is a short question.\nSenator Romney. Okay.\nChairman Rubio. Just on the issue that you talked about,\nMr. Wong, and that is the importance of small business to our\nindustrial base, do you think that, when it comes to government\ncontracting it is an enormous customer, particularly in the\nDepartment of Defense field but across the board. And this is\nmore of a 50,000-foot-level question, but is it your sense that\nin addition to having laws in place that require certain\nbehavior that there is an opening here to also have a broader\nnational conversation about the importance of a domestic\nsubcontractor and/or manufacturing supply chain that is capable\nof delivering certain steps along the process?\nSo obviously, in the realm of DoD, it is a little different\nbecause of the security elements that are built into these\ncontracts, but there are plenty of industries now in which we\nbelieve that large multinationals who are headquartered in the\nUnited States dominate a field without any sort of national\nrecognition of the fact that many of the subcontracts and\ncomponent activities underneath that big umbrella are\noftentimes having to be outsourced to other countries, because\nwe no longer have the domestic capacity to do certain things.\nAnd this becomes concerning when you begin to realize that,\nin many of these fields, that are outside the realm of DoD, but\nwhether it is telecommunications or any of these other critical\nindustries, for our future, we are not engaged in a business-\nto-business competition. These have become national\ncompetitions, oftentimes in the case of China, against\ncompanies fully backed by a large and powerful government.\nSo it appears to me that that sort of notion needs to find\nitself into this conversation as well.\nMr. Wong. Yes, sir, I agree. You did mention China, and so\nI would just simply say that one of the phenomena that they\nhave is they could be sitting in a room, they come up with an\nidea that makes sense, they can implement it in a matter of\nweeks. Our rules and regulations still require months, years.\nSo I think that if there is a way to entertain that\nconversation, absolutely. If you could include us in that we\nwould be happy to work with you on that.\nChairman Rubio. Senator Romney.\nSenator Romney. Thank you, Senator. I must begin by saying\nI am not a hostile questioner, but partially so in that I do\nnot like the idea of set-asides generally, or requirements that\npeople purchase, or that the government purchases from\ninstitutions that are either high cost or less efficient. It\nstrikes me that small businesses that have the best prospects\ncome out with better products at lower cost, and that the world\nwould beat a path to their door. But that requiring the\ngovernment to acquire products based upon other requirements\nother than the quality, price, and efficiency of the product\nbeing sold is a mistake.\nI will put that comment aside for a moment and turn to\nsomething else which is the--with regards to the program\nassociated with the net worth limit, particularly for those\nprograms helping disadvantaged women. The net worth has to be\nless than $750,000, as I understand it, and given the fact that\nthe median net worth in the country is $97,000, it strikes me\nthat if you are an individual with a net worth of $750,000,\nexcluding your home, you are probably in the top 1 percent of\nthe country. This hardly strikes me as being a program for\nunderprivileged individuals.\nShould we not reconsider what net worth is appropriate to\njustify investment in such a small enterprise owned by a person\nof that nature?\nMr. Wong. Senator, thank you for the question. If I could\nclarify, the $750,000 is a ceiling. It is not a floor. And so\nwhat we do is we limit people, that if they get into business\nand then they get up to a certain level then we kick them out.\nSenator Romney. Right. Right. But kicking them out--\n$750,000 is well above what I would consider a person that is\ndisadvantaged and needs help. If the number were $50,000 or\n$100,000 I might not, in my head. But the median in the country\nis $97,000. Why would a number like $97,000 not be the better\nnumber to use, or half that? But to say that a person can have\n$700,000 in personal net worth, excluding their home, that is\ngoing to be a relatively small cohort of individuals who would\nhave a net worth at that level.\nMr. Wong. So, anecdotally, this is my opinion. I think\nthat--and I have dealt with many businesses over the last 30\nyears, and I have run 16 of them. I think that people with\n$97,000 of personal net worth do not tend to hire many people.\nAnd so with somebody--you know, if somebody has $750,000, I\nagree, it is a higher number than the average national net\nworth, but it has been something that we have been using with\nthe 8(a) program for over 30 years. We have created a lot of\njobs. We have created a lot of businesses with that program,\nsir, and I think that it works.\nSenator Romney. I would suggest that you are not creating\nthe jobs, that people who begin those enterprises are creating\nthe jobs, their potential to find capital from other sources.\nIf they have got a great business idea and a net worth of\n$700,000, they are going to be able to begin that business and\ncreate the jobs without the help of the government. So having\nFederal dollars, having average taxpayers in America provide\nsubsidy, in effect, to individuals who have a net worth of as\nmuch as $750,000, excluding their home, strikes me as being\nexcessive and not really targeted to the people we are focused\non helping, which are people of very modest or disadvantaged\ncircumstances.\nI guess I will stop there, Mr. Chairman, other than to say\nthat I think with regards to each of these programs, we need to\nre-evaluate whether we are really helping people who could not\nget help from the private sector, and whether we are wise to\ndirect the government, in its purchasing process, to favor the\npurchase from an enterprise that is not as competitive as the\nalternatives.\nChairman Rubio. Great. Thank you very much.\nThank you both for being here. Do we have anything else?\nThank you both for being here. I am going to call up the second\npanel. Thank you for your time and for your patience, given the\nvote schedule and the delay in our start.\nMr. Shear. Thank you very much.\nChairman Rubio. So as we kind of accommodate the transition\nhere in the panel, let me introduce them, give them a few\nseconds.\nAll right. I want to introduce our second panel.\nVicki Marino is the Founder and President of Kenmar General\nContracting, in Key West, Florida. She started Kenmar in 2002.\nShe became the first female licensed general contractor in\nMonroe County, Florida. For those of you not familiar with\nMonroe County, Florida, that is the world-famous Florida Keys.\nDelali Dzirasa is the Founder and President--is that\ncorrect? Did I say that, Dzirasa?--Dzirasa is the Founder and\nPresident of Fearless, a digital services firm in Baltimore,\nMaryland, with a HUBZone certification.\nAnd Laurie Sayles is the Founder and CEO of Civility\nManagement Solutions in Hyattsville, Maryland. Her company\nprovides professional consulting services and is certified as\nan 8(a), Women-Owned, Economically Disadvantaged, Women-Owned,\nand Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business. She spent\nseven years of active duty in the Marine Corps and is the first\nfemale veteran officer on the Veteran Entrepreneurial Task\nForce.\nThank you, all three, for being here. Ms. Marino, we will\nbegin with you.\nTESTIMONY OF VICKI MARINO, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, KENMAR\nGENERAL CONTRACTING, KEY WEST, FL\nMs. Marino. Good afternoon, Chairman Rubio, Ranking Member\nCardin, and members of the Committee. My name is Vicki Marino.\nI own Kenmar General Contracting in Key West, Florida, and am\ntestifying on behalf of Women Impacting Public Policy, a\nnational, nonpartisan organization advocating on behalf of\nwomen entrepreneurs. My company is 8(a) certified, as well as\nEDWOSB certified. Thank you for inviting me to testify today.\nIn 2011, I landed my first Federal contract after success\nin the commercial marketplace as the first licensed woman\ngeneral contractor in Monroe County, Florida. Working with SBA\nand a large company, through the SBA Mentor Protege Program,\nafforded me access to the resources necessary to build past\nperformance and become a successful Federal contractor.\nI want to take a moment to give a special shout-out to a\ncontracting officer, Paula Claudio. Paula shepherded my\ncompany's WOSB, sole-source award through SOUTHCOM, making it\none of the first to be awarded to a woman-owned construction\ncompany. I cannot tell you how important this action was to\nfurther our Federal presence and to potentially earn another\nexceptional past performance rating. Due to this effort, I am\nin the process of opening an office in Puerto Rico to help with\nthe rebuilding effort.\nDespite working as hard as I could to make my 8(a)\ncertification productive, it took me all of nine years to hit\nmy stride as a Federal contractor. Had it not been for WIPP's\nprocurement expertise, receptive contracting officers, and\nsupport from the SBA, I would not have been able to get much\ntraction. I would like to share a few recommendations and\nobservations which I hope the Committee will find helpful.\nGiven the complexity of Federal contracting and the length\nof time it takes to build a CPARS exceptional evaluation\nrating, I recommended adding a transition time for 8(a) firms,\nas we transition to competing in a larger pool of small\nbusinesses. SBA's contracting resources should also be expanded\nto include support for businesses at this stage.\nWe encourage this Committee to look at changing\nsocioeconomic programs to better reflect the trends in Federal\nbuying and overcome the reluctance of agencies to use these\nprograms. WIPP members tell us that contracting officers do not\nunderstand the WOSB/EDWOSB program, requiring the WOSB small\nbusiness owners to come armed with specific instructions on how\nto use the program. We recommend streamlining small business\nprograms and requiring education for contracting officers.\nFurther, we suggest changing sole-source rules to make them\nuniform. For example, while 8(a) companies can obtain sole-\nsource contracts at $4 million or $6.5 million, without market\nresearch or justification, women-owned small businesses,\nHUBZones, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses\nrequire that a contracting officer must justify, through market\nresearch, that not two or more offers at a reasonable price are\nexpected, leading to exceedingly few sole-source awards. WIPP\nrecommends Congress put all socioeconomic contracting programs\non equal footing.\nCertification for the WOSB/EDWOSB programs should be\nstreamlined. In addition, all WOSBs who are willing to\nparticipate in the Federal market should be certified, even if\nthey do not intend to utilize the set-aside program. Certifying\nto SBA would discourage fraudulent behavior. A critical\ncomponent of certification is a site visit, so we suggest\nutilizing third-party certifiers.\nWith respect to what qualifies a woman as EDWOSB, we urge\nthe Committee to change the definition of ``net worth.'' Before\nthe age of 59\\1/2\\, retirement accounts do not count toward net\nworth calculation. If the retirement account has early\nwithdrawal penalties, it does not count toward asset total.\nHowever, retirement funds lift those penalties at age 59\\1/2\\.\nWomen who are above this age must count retirement funds, often\nresulting in disqualification for EDWOSB status, putting older\nfemale entrepreneurs at a disadvantage.\nIn addition, the current definition of what constitutes a\nwoman-owned or a minority-owned firm includes a requirement\nthat ownership must be unconditional, leading to a lack of\nequity investment in these firms. Given the size of contracts,\nthis is a barrier to growth that should be removed.\nLastly, I want to thank this Committee for passing the\nRunway Extension Act last year. This new law will greatly\nassist businesses experiencing growth in the Federal\nmarketplace. WIPP urges the Committee to continue holding SBA\naccountable as they begin the rulemaking process to expedite\nimplementation.\nIn conclusion, small business contracting programs are\ncritical to the ability for small companies like mine to obtain\nFederal contracts, but they need revamping to meet today's\nbuying realities. In addition, we should be taking what is\nworking from each program and apply it to all the other\nprograms.\nI urge you to take steps that will increase Federal buying\nfrom small businesses so that the government can meet the\nmodest goals set for women, veterans, 8(a), and HUBZone\ncertified companies.\nThis concludes my testimony and I am happy to answer any of\nyour questions. Thank you.\n[The prepared statement of Ms. Marino follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nChairman Rubio. Thank you.\nMr. Dzirasa.\nTESTIMONY OF DELALI DZIRASA, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, FEARLESS\nSOLUTIONS, BALTIMORE, MD\nMr. Dzirasa. I got a text from a friend earlier and it said\n``be sure not to embarrass the family, friends, or the\ncountry,'' so I will do my best today.\nChairman Rubio, Ranking Member Cardin, and members of the\nCommittee, thank you for your time and opportunity to testify\ntoday. My name is Delali Dzirasa and I have a confession to\nmake, that I do not belong here. You know, this was not\nsupposed to be my path and my role, so how did I end up here? I\nhad a mother that really invested in work ethic, and taught us\nas young boys you had to work hard and accomplish your dreams.\nAnd what she said was she believed in the power of human\npotential, that the power of tomorrow--that tomorrow can always\nbe better than it is today.\nAnd my dad had some lessons to learn also. We had a\nsoftware company. We worked for him as kids, and learned two\nthings. One, I love technology, and two, that I would never,\nabsolutely ever work for my dad again.\nSo based on those lessons learned, I started a company. I\nfounded Fearless in 2009. We are a digital services firm, and\nwe say our mission is to build software with a soul. And we\nreally envision a world where good software ought to power\nthings that matter, and so all of that commercial innovation\nthat you see, we want to have the power harvest within the\nFederal Government to be a benefit to the American people at\nlarge.\nGrowing up as a kid, I watched my father grow a small\nbusiness. Today, my small business powers SBA.gov, the digital\nface of the Small Business Administration, where millions of\nAmericans can grow and start their businesses and obtain\nfunding.\nI watched my mother as she cared for aging individuals.\nToday, CMS uses our technology to allow every Medicare\nbeneficiary in the country to better share patient records\nsecurely and easily.\nFearless also powers Login.gov and Search.gov, the Federal\nGovernment's search engine.\nThese lessons along the way taught me in the belief of\npotential, but I also needed an opportunity, and the SBA\nprograms provided that opportunity for me. So I am here\ntestifying on behalf of the HUBZone Council, a nonprofit trade\norganization that supports the HUBZone program, because I got\nthat opportunity, and the Council would like to thank the\nCommittee for their commitment to small businesses across the\ncountry.\nOur relationship with the HUBZone program is a bit unique.\nI heard about the program early on in our history and it was\nabout economic development communities and neighborhoods that\nneeded it. We were passionate about it, excited about it, so\nmuch so that I moved our family from the suburbs into\nBaltimore. Baltimore is a tale often of two cities, right, one\nwhere there is plenty of opportunity but also where almost a\nquarter of the population lives below the Federal poverty line.\nAs I walk to work from day to day, I see individuals,\nwhether laying on the street, and recently, a couple of weeks\nago, there was a kid that was struck by a car, one of the\n``Squeegee boys'' they call them, washing windshields, trying\nto make a couple of bucks on the way to school. These are the\nvery people the HUBZone program was meant to support, and so\nyou can imagine how I was completely heartbroken to know that\nthe HUBZone program has not met its goal, ever, in the history\nof the program. And so all of that funding, we calculated, was\nover $7 billion that were ineligible for these communities that\nneed it most were not getting there.\nSo we took it as a labor of love to figure out why and how\nwe could fix the problem. So on one end you had $7 billion. On\nthe other hand you had lots of people unemployed, that were\nlooking for opportunities, not handouts, to get jobs.\nSo that is the map at that point. We realized technology\nneeded some updates. We realized there were two major issues--\ntechnology and policy. On the tech side, we are a software\ncompany, so what did we do? We ended up taking SBA's data--the\nmap was dated, reporting the wrong information. We scraped it\non our own. We built our own map, and what we thought the map\nought to be. That eventually got the attention of SBA, which\nthen called us and awarded us a contract to modernize all of\nthe HUBZone technology nationwide.\nSo we are here to testify to say we have helped to support\nand fix some of the technology, and now we are here because we\nneed support to fix the policy.\nOn the policy side, we think there are lots of incremental\nchanges that can be made within the program, but above\nincremental changes, we think big, bold changes are needed, and\nthe bold changes that also were included in how these\ncertification programs began in the first place, are needed at\nthis time.\nThe HUBZone program is unique in how it provides and\nsupports communities, and so we ask for two things. One, we\nhave heard streamline the sole-source opportunities for HUBZone\ncompanies and all the certification programs to be on parity\nwith the 8(a) program, and two, up the small business goal, in\ngeneral, across the board. Small businesses are often called\nthe backbone of the economy, and so it is odd that they control\nand create the majority of the jobs, but yet they are a\nfraction of the percentage of revenue that goes out.\nAnd why is this important now? You have recently passed\nlegislation around opportunity zones, and so investment is\ngoing into a lot of these same communities. And so if you pair\nit with the Jobs Creation Act through the HUBZone program, we\nthink we can multiply the effect.\nSo we live in a city where the ZIP code might determine as\nmuch as a 20-year discrepancy in life expectancy, and so we\nneed bold change now. And so if today is not the chance, the\ntime for that bold change, the question really is when, and\nwhen is it going to be right?\nThank you for the opportunity and the time for my\ntestimony.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Dzirasa follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nChairman Rubio. Thank you.\nMs. Sayles.\nTESTIMONY OF LAURIE SAYLES, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CIVILITY\nMANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS, GREENBELT, MD\nMs. Sayles. Good afternoon, Chairman Rubio, Ranking Member\nCardin, and members of the Committee. My name is Laurie Sayles.\nI am a veteran who served 10 years in the United States Marine\nCorps and am now the founder and owner of Civility Management\nSolutions, a professional consulting firm working within both\nthe government and commercial space, and located in Greenbelt,\nMaryland. I am a member of Women Impacting Public Policy and\nVET-Force, both organizations who have assisted in my growth.\nCivility provides program, project, financial, and grants\nmanagement, training, conference logistics, call center, and\nadministrative support for several Federal agencies to include\nsubcontracts.\nI am passionate to testify because my company was able to\nobtain such clients due to Small Business Administration's\ncertification program. I am certified economically\ndisadvantaged and woman-owned small business, VA-verified\nservice-disabled veteran-owned, and certified 8(a)\nheadquartered in a HUBZone office. Like others, I have\nexperienced this with SBA and the Department of Veterans\nAffairs to acquire certifications.\nMy testimony today will address these contract programs\nwith the hope of providing recommendations to the Committee\nthat will assist during the reauthorization process, as well as\nenable the SBA to increase assistance to veteran and women\nsmall business owners.\nI have always been an entrepreneur. As a Marine,\nleadership, integrity, teamwork, and persistence became a way\nof life, which is essential in business. I earned the respect\nas an African-American woman in a man's world, and now am an\noutspoken advocate for veterans as I was elected as the first\nwoman officer on the VET-Force Committee. In this role, I\nlisten to many veteran small business owners on their\nfrustrations to ascertain VA certifications and opportunities\nwithin the VA.\nReturning to civilian life can be difficult. It is a\nprocess, it takes to adjust, and working with government\nagencies can become frustrating, especially understanding the\nmany regulations and rules. While a change in the 2017 NDAA\nmade much-needed improvements to the verification of veterans,\nsignificant issues of concern still remain. They are detailed\nin my written statement, but to name a few they are the\nrequirements around military spouse participation and veterans\nnot being located within a reasonable commute from job sites.\nThere is a rebuttal presumption that he or she does not control\nthe firm. However, I am very grateful for the VIP program in\nMaryland that trains military veterans in government\ncontracting which Barbara Ashe spearheaded.\nWhile I am also a woman-owned business, my fellow panelists\nalready touched on this program, so I will use the remaining\ntime to talk about the 8(a) business development program.\nCivility obtained the 8(a) certification after being in\nbusiness for four years. I utilized my local SCORE chapter for\nsupport. Do note, though, that the SBA Office of the Inspector\nGeneral reported that since 2010, there has been a consistent\ndecline in the number of small business owners participating in\nthe 8(a) program. There are many potential reasons for the\ndecrease in participation, but I would like to highlight a few\nchanges that would help.\nThe first is the requirement of the administrator to\napprove the sale of an 8(a) firm, or transfer of 8(a) contracts\nto another eligible 8(a) concern. This should be removed.\nObtaining the administrator's approval seems burdensome and\nunnecessary. Unfamiliarity and--my apologies.\nRecently, Civility was accepted in a pilot program referred\nto as the 8(a) Accelerator, that was established by the Bowie\nBIC University in Prince George's County, Maryland, to help\ntrain up 8(a) firms, and the SBA Washington District office\ncollaborated in its development. The Business Opportunity\nSpecialists can only provide procurement assistance to 8(a)\nfirms, and Congress should explore expanding their portfolios\nto include all SBA certifications, and the government would see\ntangible results.\nI lost a page and I am going to have to just move on.\nCreating a pathway forward for all certified companies to\nthrive in their businesses is important. However,\naccountability and proper implementation of SBA's contracting\nprograms is necessary, and to ensure a level playing field. The\ngovernment met its 5 percent goal of contracting with women\nonce, and has never met its HUBZone goals. I urge the Committee\nto think big when it comes to reauthorizing contracting\nprograms in order to strengthen small business growth.\nThis concludes my testimony and I am happy to answer any\nquestions.\n[The prepared statement of Ms. Sayles follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nChairman Rubio. Thank you. I am going to defer to the\nRanking Member.\nSenator Cardin. Let me thank all of our witnesses. Very,\nvery helpful. I am glad that you are here, by the way. You\nbelong here. I had a chance to be with Fearless Solutions and\nthe work that you do in helping SBA with the HUBZones is an\nimportant contribution, and it is great to see a small business\nowner doing that.\nAnd it is good to see a graduate from the VIP program that\nis here. One of the things that we talk about, Mr. Chairman, is\nproviding the technical help and assistance so that, whether it\nis a veteran-owned business or whether it is a women-owned\nbusiness or whether it is a disadvantaged 8(a) business, that\nthey have the technical help in order to understand how\nentrepreneurship can work to their advantage and they can get\ncontracts. The VIP program, which started in Montgomery County,\nby the Chamber, in which Ms. Sayles is a graduate, has been\nnow, I think, a national model, and the SBA is working with\nthem to be able to give that type of technical assistance to\nveterans so that they understand how they can use the tools\nthat are available under the SBA.\nBut I want to get to the issues that all three of you have\nraised, one way or the other, and that is how these programs\nare working. The rule of two, which does not apply to 8(a) but\ndoes apply to the women-owned small businesses, HUBZones, and\nto the veteran businesses, Ms. Marino, I think you said that is\na real impediment to the programs that require the rule of two.\nAre you all finding that to be the case, that because of the\nrequirements of having at least two businesses that it prevents\nsole-source from really working for its intended purpose?\nMr. Sayles. I would like to speak on this, sir. When I\nstarted Civility Management Solutions I had managed 128\nemployees, about $11.5 million, through seven different\nagencies. I had great relationships. They knew that I brought\ngreat work, that I could manage staff. However, as a woman-\nowned small business that had no added value for me. It took me\nto obtain, actually, the 8(a) program, of certified within four\nyears, that opened up the door, because they could not get to\nme, even though there was the opportunity through the Woman-\nOwned Small Business with a sole source. But yet I did not have\nthe past performance to compete, so that is when the\nopportunity actually opened, was when I got 8(a), not because I\nwas woman-owned.\nMr. Dzirasa. I would like to echo that sentiment as well.\nSaying we are HUBZone, both HUBZone and 8(a), received our\nHUBZone certification prior to our 8(a) certification, we have\nhad the same issue, where 8(a) just becomes the easy path,\nright. When there is a requirement and they need to get a\nrequirement done very quickly, it becomes a very fast way for\nthem to get the requirement awarded. And so even with the\nHUBZone, people still, in lieu of that, would do the 8(a) award\nand then double-count and get credit for both the 8(a) and\nHUBZone, but not doing the HUBZone direct.\nMs. Marino. I was awarded a rather good-sized sole-source\ncontract from the U.S. Army out of the 410 Contracting Command\nout of San Antonio, Texas, for SOUTHCOM. It was a $1.8 million\nsole-source project. And the only reason that I was awarded\nthat is because I brought information to the contracting\nofficer, and taught her what the FAR allowed her to do, and I\nwas the only company that could perform, because I live in Key\nWest and my company is in Key West, from Key West to Miami.\nThere were no other companies that could meet this requirement.\nIt was a mechanical contract, air conditioning.\nAnd she had pushback from her command in San Antonio, you\nknow, telling her that she could not award this sole source to\na woman-owned small business. And she said, ``Yes, I can. Here\nis the FAR and I am going to do it.'' And so she really had to\neducate her command on the regulations that she had the\nauthority to do this, and they agreed, and she did award it.\nBut had there been another woman-owned mechanical company with\nthe same capacity and past performance that I had in my town,\nthen she probably would not have been able to award it to me on\na sole-source basis.\nSo, yeah, there isn't one because we are a small town, but\nthat would hurt.\nSenator Cardin. And under the set-aside, the sole source\nunder 8(a) does not have that same burden.\nMs. Marino. That is correct. That is correct. She has the\nauthority.\nSenator Cardin. So when you say you want uniformity, I take\nit you would like uniformity based upon the 8(a) rules on----\nMs. Marino. Well, for all of the socioeconomic set-aside.\nSenator Cardin. Right.\nMs. Marino. Why are they different?\nSenator Cardin. But you want us to comply to the standard\n8(a) on sole source. Is that----\nMs. Marino. Yes. That is what we are saying, and that would\nhelp with certification too. It is already there. It would\nstreamline everything. We all agree.\nSenator Cardin. And another matter we are looking at is\nincreasing the dollar thresholds and to remove the option years\nin the calculation. Do you find that to be an impediment in\nregards to the benefits of these programs?\nMs. Marino. Can you--I do not understand the question.\nSenator Cardin. The thresholds that are there----\nMs. Marino. Right.\nSenator Cardin [continuing]. Apply to each year and the\noption years, so, therefore, if you have a five-year potential\ncontract the threshold is actually one-fifth of the full\namount. There is interest in increasing that threshold because\nof the dollar amounts of these contracts. I did not know if\nthat affected any of your businesses or not.\nMr. Dzirasa. I think so. We have seen that particular\nissue, where obviously 8(a)s are easier to award. And if they\ncan stretch them out then they just have to go back and\ncontinue to renew option after option after option. And so the\nability to have a larger threshold allows them to give more\nroom and more capacity on particular contracts.\nWe have found, in some cases, they just say the ceiling\njust is not large enough. We have to put it on a different\nvehicle, or we have to compete it, and so that delays their\nprocess. So I do think it would greatly help with the increase\nof capacity and the value of contracts.\nSenator Cardin. I would think there might also be a problem\nwith a smaller number of year contract in order to comply with\nthe cap, whereas if the option years do not count towards the\ncap you do have the predictability of a longer-term commitment\nwithout being penalized, because of the dollar amount.\nThank you all very much.\nMs. Marino. Thank you.\nChairman Rubio. Thank you. All right. Ms. Marino, let me\nask you. I understand you were the person to be awarded a sole-\nsource contract under the Women-Owned Program.\nMs. Marino. Well, out of the U.S. Army, from SOUTHCOM. I do\nnot think it was the first sole-source contract ever awarded,\nbut for that agency and that contracting command it was.\nChairman Rubio. How were you able to win that award, and\nwhat can SBA or Federal agencies do to help more women-owned\nbusinesses win these types of awards?\nMs. Marino. Well, I had to educate the contracting officer\nas to the clauses in the FAR that allowed her the authority to\nsole-source this to my firm, and I got that information from\nbeing a member of WIPP. They supported all the women-owned\nsmall businesses, gave us basically instructions on what to\ntell the contracting officer and show them their authority in\nthe FAR. So the contracting officer was not really aware of it,\nso education, I think, for the contracting officers would be\nhelpful.\nThere was pushback, as I mentioned before, from the\ncommand, the contracting command. Even they did not realize\nthat there was sole-source authority for the contracting\nofficer. So they did not realize it either.\nI think it would also be helpful, not only education for\nthe contracting officers but also reward for the contracting\nofficers for achieving the goals, the Federal goals. There does\nnot seem to be any way to recognize contracting officers that\nare doing a great job and hitting all the goals. There is\njust--it is sort of--it does not seem to be any system of\nrewarding that contracting officer for doing a good job.\nChairman Rubio. I think it just touches on something we\nmentioned earlier, is that the contracting officers of the\nvarious agencies and Federal entities are not even aware----\nMs. Marino. Right.\nChairman Rubio [continuing]. Of the opportunity to do this,\nwhich is obviously an impediment to the program moving forward.\nI think, more broadly, I guess just as a broad question,\nyou know, why is it important to be certified--for you, for\nyour business to have been certified in these two women-owned\nsmall business categories? I think you have already answered\nthis somewhat in describing this opportunity, but did it\nincrease contracting opportunities or unique resources?\nMs. Marino. Being certified 8(a) opened up a world of\nopportunity for me through the Small Business Administration.\nSmall Business Administration guaranteed my loans. The Small\nBusiness Administration helped me with guaranteeing my bonds,\nwhich is required in construction contracting. They provided\ntraining. There was so much that I got from the SBA by being an\n8(a) contractor.\nI think it is important that WOSB contractors are also\ncertified by the SBA to not only get SBA support, which is just\ncritical for growth and for success, but also it eliminates\nfraud. I think that the same sort of rigorous background check\nthat the woman is really running the company, working day-to-\nday, signing the contracts, signing the checks, getting in the\nfield, doing the work is critical. It is not just a front for\nanother business. So I think certification is really critical.\nChairman Rubio. Mr. Dzirasa, we have talked in this\nCommittee, in previous hearings, about deficiencies in\ntechnology broadly hampering the SBA's ability to manage\nprograms, but in particular the HUBZone program. In 2004, the\nGAO found that the HUBZone map, the SBA's primary way of\ncommunicating HUBZone locations to the public, was out of date.\nIt was inaccurate. In 2013, the inspector general also found\ndiscrepancies in the historical map data, which the SBA keeps\non a series of Excel spreadsheets. So think about that for a\nmoment.\nI just ask, how were you able to figure out that you were\nlocated in a HUBZone?\nMr. Dzirasa. Yeah. So interestingly enough, when we were\nfirst certified the map was reporting bad data in that\nparticular case as well. The pin was on the wrong side of the\nstreet, and we knew it was a HUBZone. So we had to go justify--\n--\nChairman Rubio. The pin was on the wrong side?\nMr. Dzirasa. Yeah. So it would show that it was not, but we\nknew that it was----\nChairman Rubio. The pin, like an actual pin?\nMr. Dzirasa. Yes, on the legacy map, did not show that--so\nthe address was--there is a HUBZone kind of a square, and the\nbuilding was clearly in there, but the pin when you put in the\naddress would put it here and say you are not qualified, and it\nwould not allow you to move forward within the process.\nThat has been fixed, so we actually know that well. We were\none of the things that helped to fix that for SBA. But at that\npoint it was difficult. I mean, you had to push back.\nChairman Rubio. You had to go find whoever was in charge of\nthe pins and----\nMr. Dzirasa [continuing]. And move the pin. That is right.\nYeah. We had to get the pin moved.\nChairman Rubio. Our work here is done then.\n[Laughter.]\nMr. Dzirasa. But in that particular case, right, if you do\nnot push back, the system would not allow you to move forward,\nand it would not even allow you to start the application at\nthat time. And that has been cleaned up. It has taken, well,\nobviously from 2004, that you mentioned, to we were awarded a\ncontract in 2016, and by 2017, in six months, we had the first\nmodernization MVP out the door. And so I think some of those\nthings are starting to trend in the right direction.\nChairman Rubio. Yeah. And Ms. Sayles, within the four prime\ncontracting programs at SBA there are different processes for\nbecoming certified for participation, as we have talked about.\nYou are in a unique experience of having--you have had\nexperiences with three of these four programs.\nMr. Sayles. Yes, sir.\nChairman Rubio. I am curious to know which of the three did\nyou find to be the easiest and which one was the hardest?\nMr. Sayles. Actually, the Department of Veterans Affairs\nhas improved theirs, because they are also online, but the\nCertify.SBA.gov site has been fabulous. And as an 8(a) firm,\neven going in and doing the self-certification for the woman-\nowned and economically woman-owned small business, they are\nable to pull that information that is already in the system\nfrom me being an 8(a) certified company and apply it to the\nprocess.\nSo some of the questions were ``Are you an 8(a) firm?''\nYes. And based off of that I answered less questions to get\nthrough that certification process.\nSo, yes, and may I add that a lot of veteran service\norganizations are in agreement with the VA certification going\nover to the SBA office, so that they are all housed within the\nsame place, which should also add more simplification to the\ncertification process.\nChairman Rubio. We talked also, earlier in the hearing,\nabout the statutory award goal of 23 percent of contracts to\nsmall businesses. The Scorecard is supposed to measure how well\nagencies are complying with this goal, but as you may have\nheard and seen and probably knew before, GAO reports found some\nissues with this. In your opinion, having experience with\nthese, what does the Scorecard get right and what needs\nimprovement?\nMr. Sayles. Are you speaking to me, sir? My apologies.\nActually, I am not as well versed. I just do know that a lot of\ncommunity, as a whole, in the small business, do question\nwhether or not the Small Business Administration Scorecard is\naccurate.\nChairman Rubio. Based on their interaction with these\nagencies and in terms of knowing what they know about the way\nthese agencies perform----\nMr. Sayles. That is correct, and how the data is collected\nand how it is produced for us all to review it. There are a lot\nof entities of businesses, as well as organizations, that do\nquestion whether or not the data is correct.\nMr. Dzirasa. Yeah. I would like to echo. I also think there\nare questions about the double counting. So if you award a\ncontract to a particular entity that has multiple\ncertifications, they are allowed to count that they have\nreceived credit for all of them, and so it is not clear. If\nsomeone is woman-owned, HUBZone, and 8(a) and they do an 8(a)\nsole-source, they get a triple count. So I am unclear if that\nthen bubbles up into all of those numbers, as far as them\nmeeting the goals or not. So it is unclear how factual that\ndata might be.\nChairman Rubio. And you are not in, obviously, a great\nposition to see every contract that is going out, but I know\nthat there is skepticism among many in the small business\ncommunity about whether, in fact, the numbers that are being\nreflected are the ones that these agencies are meeting. And as\nyou have heard here in the testimony today, because that is a\nholistic number. So if some agency is doing 33, then somebody\nelse can do less, and it often times depends on the types of\ncontracts they are awarding.\nBut I know we have heard great skepticism across that, that\neven some of the reported numbers are not accurate, which is\nwhy the transparency part of the Scorecard is important, so\npeople have confidence that these are the sort of priorities\nthat are being met and addressed.\nSenator Risch, did you have questions?\nSenator Risch. No, I did not. Thank you for holding this\nhearing. It is an important hearing, and I know there are\nissues being raised. I appreciate you doing this so we can\nexplore them. Thank you.\nChairman Rubio. I did want to ask one more question of Ms.\nMarino. You are a participant in the 8(a) program. You have\naccess to--you have talked about this a little bit, all the\ndifferent components on the bonding capacity and so forth that\nhave made you eligible for. You also have access to training,\ntechnical assistance, in addition to being able to compete for\nthe set-aside.\nSince you are active in the small business community as\nwell, would this same type of training, in your view--on the\ntraining part of it, which you may or may not have availed\nyourself of heavily, but, I do not know. Maybe you did. But\nwould that be useful to other contractors that you know from\nFlorida or through the Women Impacting Public Policy?\nMs. Marino. So I did participate in 7(j) training, webinar-\nbased training that the SBA provides at no charge, and I found\nthat that training was sort of elementary. And really what\nhelped me move forward in my career and really gain contracts,\nwhich is the object, right, was really more one-on-one\ntraining, and, in particular, the Mentor Protege Program was\nreally, really helpful to me. I was in the program for two\nyears with a large Federal contractor, and in that two-year\nperiod I learned what to do and what not to do, as a Federal\ncontractor, and I gained from them all sorts of documentation\nthat I needed moving forward, to be a successful Federal\ncontractor.\nAnd the SBA really held my mentor's feet to the fire, to\nmake absolutely sure that they were giving me the tools that I\nneeded and really training me and bringing me along so that I\ncould succeed. And after two years in the program, sort of\nlittle by little I started to fly on my own with small job--\n$50,000, $100,000--that just sort of grew over time. It took a\nlong time but that meant the protege program was really the\nbest education for me, as a Federal contractor.\nChairman Rubio. And I would also imagine that these\ncontracts have a cumulative effect, in essence, each time you\ncomplete one it sort of opens the door to other ones----\nMs. Marino. Yes.\nChairman Rubio [continuing]. Either by reputation on the\ncommercial side, outside of the government contracting----\nMs. Marino. Yes.\nChairman Rubio [continuing]. The building capacity, or the\nability to gain the confidence of those awarding these\ncontracts that you can actually do the work.\nMs. Marino. Exactly. If you do a good job----\nChairman Rubio. I think that is probably true for all of\nyou.\nMs. Marino. Yeah. Good evaluations are everything.\nChairman Rubio. Well, I want to thank you guys for being\nhere and for your patience. We had votes today and we made the\ndecision to ride it out until 3:00 p.m. Otherwise, you would\nhave seen people running in and out all the time. But we are--\nis this our last hearing or do we have another reauthorization?\nWe have two more. Lucky me.\n[Laughter.]\nAnd you do not have to come to those. You can watch. It is\non like C-SPAN 14, whatever. But as we work through this\nreauthorization it has really also been very educational to\nkind of get into the structure of the agency and all of its\ndifferent programs, and find what it does well, hear these\nstories about how these programs are making a difference, but\nalso to identify deficiencies and look for ways to authorize\nthem.\nIn a time when obviously there are a lot divisive issues in\nAmerican politics, small business is one that is not, and I\nhope you sense from the questions here today and some of the\ncomments that I think we have a unique opportunity to do\nsomething here that can actually pass, because it does not\nreally have a partisan component to it, or even an ideological\none. And it is something that the vast majority of Americans,\ncertainly members of the Senate, are supportive of. Everybody\nhas a small business in their state, more than one, obviously,\nand many come from small business backgrounds as well. So I am\ngrateful for your input today because it will make a\ndifference.\nThe hearing record for this will remain open for two weeks.\nAny statements or questions for the record should be submitted\nby Wednesday, June 26th, at 5:00 p.m. It is possible that some\nof the members that were not here or had to leave early might\nhave a written question. If you can answer it, it would be\ngreat. It could be part of our record, and we can point back to\nit as we do our work. Thank you so much.\nWith that the hearing is adjourned.\n[Whereupon, at 4:58 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]\nAPPENDIX MATERIAL SUBMITTED\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]"
