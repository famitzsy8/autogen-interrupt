Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ``Quantum Network Infrastructure Act
of 2021''.
SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.
Section 2 of the National Quantum Initiative Act (15 U.S.C. 8801)
is amended--
(1) by redesignating paragraph (7) as paragraph (8); and
(2) by inserting after paragraph (6) the following:
``(7) Quantum network infrastructure.--The term `quantum
network infrastructure' means any facility, expertise, or
capability that is necessary to enable the development and
deployment of scalable and diverse quantum network
technologies.''.
SEC. 3. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY QUANTUM NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.
Title IV of the National Quantum Initiative Act (15 U.S.C. 8851 et
seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:
``SEC. 403. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY QUANTUM NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.
``(a) In General.--The Secretary of Energy (referred to in this
section as the `Secretary') shall carry out a research, development,
and demonstration program to accelerate innovation in quantum network
infrastructure in order to--
``(1) facilitate the advancement of distributed quantum
computing systems through the internet and intranet;
``(2) improve the precision of measurements of scientific
phenomena and physical imaging technologies; and
``(3) develop secure national quantum communications
technologies and strategies.
``(b) Program.--In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall--
``(1) coordinate with--
``(A) the Director of the National Science
Foundation;
``(B) the Director of the National Institute of
Standards and Technology;
``(C) the Chair of the subcommittee on Quantum
Information Science of the National Science and
Technology Council established under section 103(a);
and
``(D) the Chair of the subcommittee on the Economic
and Security Implications of Quantum Science;
``(2) conduct cooperative research with industry, National
Laboratories, institutions of higher education, and other
research institutions to facilitate new quantum infrastructure
methods and technologies, including--
``(A) quantum-limited detectors, ultra-low loss
optical channels, space-to-ground connections, and
classical networking and cybersecurity protocols;
``(B) entanglement and hyper-entangled state
sources and transmission, control, and measurement of
quantum states;
``(C) quantum interconnects that allow short range
local connections between quantum processors;
``(D) transducers for quantum sources and signals
between optical and telecommunications regimes and
quantum computer-relevant domains, including
microwaves;
``(E) development of quantum memory buffers and
small-scale quantum computers that are compatible with
photon-based quantum bits in the optical or
telecommunications wavelengths;
``(F) long-range entanglement distribution at both
the terrestrial and space-based level using quantum
repeaters, allowing entanglement-based protocols
between small- and large-scale quantum processors;
``(G) quantum routers, multiplexers, repeaters, and
related technologies necessary to create secure long-
distance quantum communication; and
``(H) integration of systems across the quantum
technology stack into traditional computing networks,
including the development of remote controlled, high
performance, and reliable implementations of key
quantum network components;
``(3) engage with the Quantum Economic Development
Consortium (QED-C) to transition component technologies to help
facilitate as appropriate the development of a quantum supply
chain for quantum network technologies;
``(4) advance basic research in advanced scientific
computing and material science to enhance the understanding,
prediction, and manipulation of materials and processes
relevant to quantum network infrastructure;
``(5) develop experimental tools and testbeds necessary to
support cross-cutting fundamental research and development
activities with diverse stakeholders from industry and
institutions of higher education; and
``(6) consider quantum network infrastructure applications
that span the Department of Energy's missions in energy,
environment, and national security.
``(c) Leveraging.--In carrying out this section, the Secretary
shall leverage resources, infrastructure, and expertise across the
Department of Energy and from--
``(1) the National Institute of Standards and Technology;
``(2) the National Science Foundation;
``(3) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration;
``(4) other relevant Federal agencies;
``(5) the National Laboratories;
``(6) industry stakeholders;
``(7) institutions of higher education; and
``(8) the National Quantum Information Science Research
Centers.
``(d) Research Plan.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the
enactment of the Quantum Network Infrastructure Act of 2021, the
Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Science, Space, and
Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy
and Natural Resources of the Senate, a 4-year research plan that
identifies and prioritizes basic research needs relating to quantum
network infrastructure.
``(e) Standard of Review.--The Secretary shall review activities
carried out under this section to determine the achievement of
technical milestones.
``(f) Funding.--Funds authorized to be appropriated for the
Department of Energy's Office of Science, there shall be made available
to the Secretary to carry out the activities under this section,
$100,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026.''.
