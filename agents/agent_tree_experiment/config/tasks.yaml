    We will have to do a detailed investigation about {bill}.
    You are working in a team of three specialists. 
    You are orchestrating the team, consisting of the specialist in committees, a specialist in the text of bills, a specialist in the actions of the Congress, a specialist in the amendments made, and a specialist about the Congress members.
    You will have to work together to find out everything there is to know about the bill.

    For you, this process will be a step-by-step investigation. Upon recieving data from a tool call, you should enquire what this data tells you,
    and what it prompts you to find out next. For this you will always have 2 options:

    1. instruct another agent on a high-level what he should do next and find out given your findings and information.
    2. Compile the table that is needed to answer the question and END the task.

    As soon as you are satisfied with the completeness of your investigative work, and you have a very well-formed understanding which Congress members were involved to which
    degree in the {advancement} of bill {bill} you can output a table ranking ALL the committee members by their involvement.

    This is how the table should be structured (purely for example purposes):

    | Congress Member       | Involvement Rank | Reason                                                                                                      |
    |-----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | John Doe              | 1                | As the leader of the Republican majority in the Committee, co-Authored the Doe-Barasso committee amendment, making the bill more comprehensive and ready to be discussed on the House floor. From Maryland, a state where port infrastructure is key to the the local industry. 
    | Jane Smith            | 2                | As the rank 5 of the Republican majority in the committee co-sponsored the Doe-Barasso amendment in the committee, showing interest in the {advancement} and the discussion of the bill. From Illnois, a state which is not really involved in the shipping industry.  |
    | Dan Davis             | 3                | As a co-sponsor of the original bill text, he was one of the first in the timeline to show interest in the {advancement} of the bill. From Tenessee, a landlocked state which is not really involved in the shipping industry.
    | ...                   | ...              | ...

    For this table, rely primarily on the information you have gathered from the committee_specialist and the bill_specialist (because it is the information that is almost always available), but if there are any other factors or information that play an important role in {bill}'s {advancement}, weigh all the actor's actions against each other to make a comprehensive table. 
    Investigate, call and clarify step-by-step with the agents at your disposal!
