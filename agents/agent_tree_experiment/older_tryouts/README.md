# Older Tryouts

- `back_forth.py`
- `back_forth2.py`

These are files that I used to run some `autogen` code, in order to get familiar with the library.
Now this is dead code and just serves documentation purposes.

- `tool_call_exp.py`
- `test_messages.py`

In these files I conducted a small experiment to determine different models' tool call abilities (see the log entry for July 28th)

WARNING: Running this archived code will result in an import error of local libraries. Move it one directory up (to `/agent_tree_experiment` to see it working)
