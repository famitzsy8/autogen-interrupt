# big_task:
#   description: >
#     Compile a throughly-researched report, about the legislative actions you are given
#     that were most relevant to {company}'s interests in the bill {bill} of the United States Congress.
#     The relevance should be estimated by the degree of potential reward a lobbying group for {company}
#     could invest into a specific action. Also, the relevance of the actions should be estimated relatively to each other,
#     meaning that the absence of an action (say, a bill got a committee referral and never got out of it) also plays a highly important role.

#     A detailed report, listing the most important legislative actions (or inactions) that foster or hinder {company}'s interests.
