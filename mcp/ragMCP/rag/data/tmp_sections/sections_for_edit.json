DEFINITIONS.\nIn this Act:\n(1) Energy storage system.--The term ``energy storage\nsystem'' means equipment or facilities relating to the electric\ngrid that are capable of absorbing energy, storing the energy\nfor a period of time, and dispatching the energy, that--\n(A) use mechanical, electrochemical, biochemical,\nor thermal processes to store energy that was generated\nat an earlier time for use at a later time;\n(B) use mechanical, electrochemical, biochemical,\nor thermal processes to store energy generated from\nmechanical processes that would otherwise be wasted for\ndelivery at a later time; or\n(C) store thermal energy for direct use for heating\nor cooling at a later time in a manner that avoids the\nneed to use electricity at that later time, as is\noffered by grid-enabled water heaters.\n(2) Islanding.--The term ``islanding'' means a distributed\ngenerator or energy storage device continuing to power a\nlocation in the absence of electric power from the primary\nsource.\n(3) Microgrid.--The term ``microgrid'' means an integrated\nenergy system consisting of interconnected loads and\ndistributed energy resources, including generators and energy\nstorage devices, within clearly defined electrical boundaries\nthat--\n(A) acts as a single controllable entity with\nrespect to the grid; and\n(B) can connect and disconnect from the grid to\noperate in both grid-connected mode and island mode.\n(4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary\nof Energy."
