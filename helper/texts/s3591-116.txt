<DELETED>SEC. 1206. ARCTIC DEEP DRAFT PORT.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) The strategic importance of the Arctic 
        continues to increase as the United States and other countries 
        recognize the economic and military significance of the sea 
        lanes and choke points within the region and understand the 
        potential for power projection from the Arctic into multiple 
        regions.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) On January 19, 2018, Secretary of Defense 
        James Mattis released the ``2018 National Defense Strategy of 
        the United States of America'' in which the Secretary outlined 
        the reemergence of long-term, strategic competition by 
        countries such as China and Russia.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) Russia and China have conducted military 
        exercises together in the Arctic, have agreed to connect the 
        Northern Sea Route, claimed by Russia, with the Maritime Silk 
        Road of China, and are working together in developing natural 
        gas resources in the Arctic.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) The Government of the Russian Federation has 
        prioritized the development of Arctic capabilities and has made 
        significant investments in military infrastructure in the 
        Arctic, including the creation of a new Arctic Command and the 
        construction or refurbishment of 16 deepwater ports and 14 
        airfields in the region.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (5) The Government of the People's Republic of 
        China--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) released, in January 2018, its new 
                Arctic Strategy, the Polar Silk Road, in which it 
                declares itself as a ``near-Arctic state''; 
                and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (B) has publicly stated that it seeks to 
                expand its ``Belt and Road Initiative'' to the Arctic 
                region, including current investment in the natural gas 
                fields in the Yamal Peninsula in Russia, rare-earth 
                element mines in Greenland, and the real estate, 
                alternative energy, and fisheries in Iceland.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (6) The significance of the Arctic continues to 
        grow as countries around the globe begin to understand the 
        magnitude of the natural resources in the Arctic, including, at 
        a minimum, oil, natural gas, rare earth minerals, gold, 
        diamonds, and abundant fisheries.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (7) The Bering Strait is experiencing significant 
        increases in international traffic from vessels transiting the 
        Northern Sea Route, increases that are projected to continue if 
        decreases in sea ice coverage continue.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (8) Increases in human, maritime, and resource 
        development activity in the Arctic region create additional 
        mission requirements for Federal agencies, given--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) the strategic focus of the Government 
                of the Russian Federation and the Government of the 
                People's Republic of China on the Arctic;</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (B) overlapping territorial claims; 
                and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (C) the potential for maritime accidents, 
                oil spills, and illegal fishing near the exclusive 
                economic zone of the United States.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (9) The increasing role of the United States in 
        the Arctic has been highlighted in each of the last 4 National 
        Defense Authorization Acts.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (10) The United States Coast Guard Arctic 
        Strategic Outlook released in April 2019 states that 
        ``[d]emonstrating commitment to operational presence, Canada, 
        Denmark, and Norway have made strategic investments in ice-
        capable patrol ships charged with national or homeland security 
        missions. [The United States] is the only country with an 
        Arctic presence that has not made similar investments in ice-
        capable surface maritime security assets. This limits the 
        ability of the Coast Guard, and the Nation, to credibly uphold 
        sovereignty or respond to contingencies in the 
        Arctic''.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (11) On December 6, 2018, Secretary of the Navy 
        Richard Spencer stated that ``[w]e need to have a strategic 
        Arctic port up in Alaska''.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (12) Meanwhile, the 2 closest strategic seaports, 
        as designated by the Department of Defense, to the Arctic 
        Circle are the Port of Anchorage and the Port of Tacoma, 
        located approximately 1,500 nautical miles and 2,400 nautical 
        miles away, respectively, and approximately 1,900 nautical 
        miles and 2,800 nautical miles, respectively, from Barrow, 
        Alaska.</DELETED>
<DELETED>    (b) Definition of Arctic.--In this section, the term 
``Arctic'' has the meaning given the term in section 112 of the Arctic 
Research and Policy Act of 1984 (15 U.S.C. 4111).</DELETED>
<DELETED>    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) the Arctic is a region of strategic importance 
        to the national security interests of the United 
        States;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) there is a compelling national, regional, 
        Alaska Native, and private sector need for permanent maritime 
        and other infrastructure development and for a presence in the 
        Arctic region by the United States to support and facilitate 
        search and rescue, shipping safety, economic development, oil 
        spill prevention and response, protection of subsistence and 
        commercial fishing, port of refuge, Arctic research, and 
        maritime law enforcement on the Bering Sea, the Chukchi Sea, 
        and the Arctic Ocean; and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) it is in the national interest to enhance 
        existing and develop maritime and other infrastructure in the 
        Arctic that would allow the Coast Guard and the Navy each to 
        perform their respective statutory duties and functions on a 
        more permanent basis with minimal mission 
        interruption.</DELETED>
<DELETED>    (d) United States Arctic Deep Draft Port.--The Secretary

        and
            (3) expedite the completion of a feasibility study for the 
        acceptable alternative identified under paragraph (2).

SEC. 1206. ARCTIC DEEP DRAFT PORT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The strategic importance of the Arctic continues to 
        increase as the United States and other countries recognize the 
        economic and military significance of the sea lanes and choke 
        points within the region and understand the potential for power 
        projection from the Arctic into multiple regions.
            (2) On January 19, 2018, Secretary of Defense James Mattis 
        released the ``2018 National Defense Strategy of the United 
        States of America'' in which the Secretary outlined the 
        reemergence of long-term, strategic competition by countries 
        such as China and Russia.
            (3) Russia and China have conducted military exercises 
        together in the Arctic, have agreed to connect the Northern Sea 
        Route, claimed by Russia, with the Maritime Silk Road of China, 
        and are working together in developing natural gas resources in 
        the Arctic.
            (4) The Government of the Russian Federation has 
        prioritized the development of Arctic capabilities and has made 
        significant investments in military infrastructure in the 
        Arctic, including the creation of a new Arctic Command and the 
        construction or refurbishment of 16 deepwater ports and 14 
        airfields in the region.
            (5) The Government of the People's Republic of China--
                    (A) released, in January 2018, its new Arctic 
                Strategy, the Polar Silk Road, in which it declares 
                itself as a ``near-Arctic state''; and
                    (B) has publicly stated that it seeks to expand its 
                ``Belt and Road Initiative'' to the Arctic region, 
                including current investment in the natural gas fields 
                in the Yamal Peninsula in Russia, rare-earth element 
                mines in Greenland, and the real estate, alternative 
                energy, and fisheries in Iceland.
            (6) The significance of the Arctic continues to grow as 
        countries around the globe begin to understand the magnitude of 
        the natural resources in the Arctic, including, at a minimum, 
        oil, natural gas, rare earth minerals, gold, diamonds, and 
        abundant fisheries.
            (7) The Bering Strait is experiencing significant increases 
        in international traffic from vessels transiting the Northern 
        Sea Route, increases that are projected to continue if 
        decreases in sea ice coverage continue.
            (8) Increases in human, maritime, and resource development 
        activity in the Arctic region create additional mission 
        requirements for Federal agencies, given--
                    (A) the strategic focus of the Government of the 
                Russian Federation and the Government of the People's 
                Republic of China on the Arctic;
                    (B) overlapping territorial claims; and
                    (C) the potential for maritime accidents, oil 
                spills, and illegal fishing near the exclusive economic 
                zone of the United States.
            (9) The increasing role of the United States in the Arctic 
        has been highlighted in each of the last 4 National Defense 
        Authorization Acts.
            (10) The United States Coast Guard Arctic Strategic Outlook 
        released in April 2019 states that ``[d]emonstrating commitment 
        to operational presence, Canada, Denmark, and Norway have made 
        strategic investments in ice-capable patrol ships charged with 
        national or homeland security missions. [The United States] is 
        the only country with an Arctic presence that has not made 
        similar investments in ice-capable surface maritime security 
        assets. This limits the ability of the Coast Guard, and the 
        Nation, to credibly uphold sovereignty or respond to 
        contingencies in the Arctic''.
            (11) On December 6, 2018, Secretary of the Navy Richard 
        Spencer stated that ``[w]e need to have a strategic Arctic port 
        up in Alaska''.
            (12) Meanwhile, the 2 closest strategic seaports, as 
        designated by the Department of Defense, to the Arctic Circle 
        are the Port of Anchorage and the Port of Tacoma, located 
        approximately 1,500 nautical miles and 2,400 nautical miles 
        away, respectively, and approximately 1,900 nautical miles and 
        2,800 nautical miles, respectively, from Barrow, Alaska.
    (b) Definition of Arctic.--In this section, the term ``Arctic'' has 
the meaning given the term in section 112 of the Arctic Research and 
Policy Act of 1984 (15 U.S.C. 4111).
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Arctic is a region of strategic importance to the 
        national security interests of the United States;
            (2) there is a compelling national, regional, Alaska 
        Native, and private sector need for permanent maritime and 
        other infrastructure development and for a presence in the 
        Arctic region by the United States to support and facilitate 
        search and rescue, shipping safety, economic development, oil 
        spill prevention and response, protection of subsistence and 
        commercial fishing, port of refuge, Arctic research, and 
        maritime law enforcement on the Bering Sea, the Chukchi Sea, 
        and the Arctic Ocean; and
            (3) it is in the national interest to enhance existing and 
        develop maritime and other infrastructure in the Arctic that 
        would allow the Coast Guard and the Navy each to perform their 
        respective statutory duties and functions on a more permanent 
        basis with minimal mission interruption.
    (d) United States Arctic Deep Draft Port.--The Secretary shall 
expedite the completion of the applicable decision document for the 
project for navigation, Arctic Deep Draft Port, Nome, Alaska.
