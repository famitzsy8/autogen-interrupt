SEC. 1206. ARCTIC DEEP DRAFT PORT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The strategic importance of the Arctic continues to 
        increase as the United States and other countries recognize the 
        economic and military significance of the sea lanes and choke 
        points within the region and understand the potential for power 
        projection from the Arctic into multiple regions.
            (2) On January 19, 2018, Secretary of Defense James Mattis 
        released the ``2018 National Defense Strategy of the United 
        States of America'' in which the Secretary outlined the 
        reemergence of long-term, strategic competition by countries 
        such as China and Russia.
            (3) Russia and China have conducted military exercises 
        together in the Arctic, have agreed to connect the Northern Sea 
        Route, claimed by Russia, with the Maritime Silk Road of China, 
        and are working together in developing natural gas resources in 
        the Arctic.
            (4) The Government of the Russian Federation has 
        prioritized the development of Arctic capabilities and has made 
        significant investments in military infrastructure in the 
        Arctic, including the creation of a new Arctic Command and the 
        construction or refurbishment of 16 deepwater ports and 14 
        airfields in the region.
            (5) The Government of the People's Republic of China--
                    (A) released, in January 2018, its new Arctic 
                Strategy, the Polar Silk Road, in which it declares 
                itself as a ``near-Arctic state''; and
                    (B) has publicly stated that it seeks to expand its 
                ``Belt and Road Initiative'' to the Arctic region, 
                including current investment in the natural gas fields 
                in the Yamal Peninsula in Russia, rare-earth element 
                mines in Greenland, and the real estate, alternative 
                energy, and fisheries in Iceland.
            (6) The significance of the Arctic continues to grow as 
        countries around the globe begin to understand the magnitude of 
        the natural resources in the Arctic, including, at a minimum, 
        oil, natural gas, rare earth minerals, gold, diamonds, and 
        abundant fisheries.
            (7) The Bering Strait is experiencing significant increases 
        in international traffic from vessels transiting the Northern 
        Sea Route, increases that are projected to continue if 
        decreases in sea ice coverage continue.
            (8) Increases in human, maritime, and resource development 
        activity in the Arctic region create additional mission 
        requirements for Federal agencies, given--
                    (A) the strategic focus of the Government of the 
                Russian Federation and the Government of the People's 
                Republic of China on the Arctic;
                    (B) overlapping territorial claims; and
                    (C) the potential for maritime accidents, oil 
                spills, and illegal fishing near the exclusive economic 
                zone of the United States.
            (9) The increasing role of the United States in the Arctic 
        has been highlighted in each of the last 4 National Defense 
        Authorization Acts.
            (10) The United States Coast Guard Arctic Strategic Outlook 
        released in April 2019 states that ``[d]emonstrating commitment 
        to operational presence, Canada, Denmark, and Norway have made 
        strategic investments in ice-capable patrol ships charged with 
        national or homeland security missions. [The United States] is 
        the only country with an Arctic presence that has not made 
        similar investments in ice-capable surface maritime security 
        assets. This limits the ability of the Coast Guard, and the 
        Nation, to credibly uphold sovereignty or respond to 
        contingencies in the Arctic''.
            (11) On December 6, 2018, Secretary of the Navy Richard 
        Spencer stated that ``[w]e need to have a strategic Arctic port 
        up in Alaska''.
            (12) Meanwhile, the 2 closest strategic seaports, as 
        designated by the Department of Defense, to the Arctic Circle 
        are the Port of Anchorage and the Port of Tacoma, located 
        approximately 1,500 nautical miles and 2,400 nautical miles 
        away, respectively, and approximately 1,900 nautical miles and 
        2,800 nautical miles, respectively, from Barrow, Alaska.
    (b) Definition of Arctic.--In this section, the term ``Arctic'' has 
the meaning given the term in section 112 of the Arctic Research and 
Policy Act of 1984 (15 U.S.C. 4111).
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Arctic is a region of strategic importance to the 
        national security interests of the United States;
            (2) there is a compelling national, regional, Alaska 
        Native, and private sector need for permanent maritime and 
        other infrastructure development and for a presence in the 
        Arctic region by the United States to support and facilitate 
        search and rescue, shipping safety, economic development, oil 
        spill prevention and response, protection of subsistence and 
        commercial fishing, port of refuge, Arctic research, and 
        maritime law enforcement on the Bering Sea, the Chukchi Sea, 
        and the Arctic Ocean; and
            (3) it is in the national interest to enhance existing and 
        develop maritime and other infrastructure in the Arctic that 
        would allow the Coast Guard and the Navy each to perform their 
        respective statutory duties and functions on a more permanent 
        basis with minimal mission interruption.
    (d) United States Arctic Deep Draft Port.--The Secretary shall 
expedite the completion of the applicable decision document for the 
project for navigation, Arctic Deep Draft Port, Nome, Alaska.
