# MCP Server Utility Functions

Here we have defined the more complex logic that we use in the `main.py` file. It is divided into the following subsections:

- `clients/`: Contain logic that build the API clients and fetch the API keys necessary for that
- `fetch/`: Contains the logic to fetch the MCP function descriptions that will be presented to the agents
- `parse/`: Contains the complex and specific parsing logic used to transform obtained data vectors from the Congress and GovInfo API
