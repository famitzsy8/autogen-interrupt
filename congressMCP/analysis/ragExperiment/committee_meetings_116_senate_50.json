Marco Rubio,\nChairman of the Committee, presiding.\nPresent: Senators Rubio, Ernst, Young, Kennedy, Romney,\nHawley, Cardin, Cantwell, Shaheen, Coons, and Duckworth.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARCO RUBIO, CHAIRMAN, A U.S. SENATOR\nFROM FLORIDA\nChairman Rubio. Today's hearing of the Senate Committee on\nBusiness and Entrepreneurship will come to order. I apologize.\nWe are in the grips of a terrible plot against the Senate Small\nBusiness Committee. They keep scheduling like 18 votes at the\nsame time as our meeting. I think we are going to change our\nname. But anyway, so the members will be coming in and out. I\ndo not know what the--no one can tell us exactly what the\nfuture holds, but they will keep us up-to-date here on it. And\nSenator Cardin will be in in a minute.\nI am going to abbreviate my opening statement in the\ninterest of time so we can get through this and not delay it\nany further.\nToday we are going to be having a pretty good conversation\nabout the SBIC program, which is one of the earliest SBA\nprograms. The impetus was a Federal Reserve Report that showed\nsignificant gaps in the business credit and equity markets,\nwith the most prominent gap being found in the small business\nsector. And the report recommended the SBA to create a program\nto provide equity financing to small businesses. This resulted\nin the SBIC program that, in turn, popularized the venture\ncapital model of investment in the 1960s and 1970s. And since\nthen, the program has continued to provide venture capital\nfinancing to fill the gap in investment in small business by\nthe private sector.\nThe impact of the program is immense. In 2017, the Library\nof Congress prepared a report that measured the role of the\nprogram in small business job creation. It only covered the\ntimeframe between October 1995 and December 2014, but found\nthat the program created almost 3 million jobs during this\nperiod, which is one new job created for every $14,000 in SBIC\ninvestment. It also looked at administrative costs, and found\nthe average administrative cost was approximately $35 per job\ncreated. So it is a clear example of the type of public-private\npartnership that fills a gap in the private marketplace and\ncreates quantifiable results.\nIt is a proven program that has historically met investment\nneeds not being met by the private sector, and so it is prudent\nto reassess the state of investment in the United States,\nidentify gaps in financing, and evaluate the opportunities that\nexist for this program to fill those gaps under current\nexample.\nFor example, there are meaningful market failures in the\ncurrent configuration of the American innovation and advanced\nmanufacturing ecosystem. The United States is beginning now the\ndifficult work of confronting Chinese industrial policy, which\nhas a clear goal of dominating the most important industries of\nthe century, through government support, credits, access to\nguaranteed market share in their own large, domestic market.\nAnd so it is prudent for us to consider how we align public\npolicy to address these market failures in the light of this\ndirect national competition.\nThe access to capital challenge that is facing innovative\nAmerican firms with high-growth potential is damaging our\ncountry's competitiveness, and the financing gap is not being\nfilled by private investment. Today, venture capital funding in\nthe U.S. is highly concentrated by geography, primarily in\nareas like San Francisco, New York, and Boston, and by\nindustry, largely to information and communication technology\ncompanies.\nThe relatively short window for expected returns, combined\nwith the prioritization of highly scalable, capital-light\nbusinesses for investment, skews funding toward digital\ntechnology and skews it away from capital-intensive\nmanufacturing sectors with longer profit horizons. So creating\nan environment in which U.S. firms can compete globally, while\ncreating jobs in the United States, is in our vital interest,\nbecause if the policy fails to address it, the United States\nwill continue to lose to other nations, both in our capacity to\nproduce now and our capacity to innovate in the future.\nThese small advanced manufacturing firms, in particular,\nface a debilitating lack of access to critical finance in the\nU.S. Innovative firms engaged in complex, advanced\nmanufacturing production require larger amounts of capital and\nthey also require more time than non-production firms. While\nthese kinds of firms can often find financing for the earlier\nstages of their development, they face difficulty accessing\nfinancing when they reach the larger-scale production and\ncommercialization stage. Since innovation and production are so\nclosely interwoven in advanced manufacturing, losing the\nability to engage in advanced manufacturing production is\nprohibitive to the ability to innovate and conduct high-level\nresearch and development.\nSo the SBIC program is uniquely positioned to play a role\nin filling this gap in financing and to leverage private\ndomestic investment. After all, one of its tenets is to support\nindustries that will undergird our national competitiveness.\nOur discussion today will explore the role of the SBIC\nprogram, the role it can play in this national discussion, as\nwell as further expand upon its history, stability, and\nsuccess. I look forward to discussing this with everyone.\nAre you ready?\nSenator Cardin. I am ready.\nChairman Rubio. All right. I will turn it over to the\nRanking Member.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN, A U.S. SENATOR\nFROM MARYLAND\nSenator Cardin. First, let me apologize for the lateness of\nstarting this. As I am sure the Chairman has explained, we have\nbeen in a series of votes on the floor of the Senate, and there\nhas been some discussion as to how we are going to proceed\nlater today. I was involved in some of those discussions so I\napologize for being a little bit late.\nI want to welcome all of our witnesses. This is our seventh\nhearing in regard to the reauthorization of the programs under\nthe Small Business Administration.\nI think we all understand that the building block needed to\nstart and grow business is capital, so today's hearing is\nparticularly important. It was in 1958 that the Small Business\nInvestment Act was passed by Congress, which recognized the\nrealities that for small business it is very difficult to find\ninvestment dollars.\nSince then, the SBIC program has invested more than $97\nbillion in 10,000 small businesses, including many well-known\ncompanies like Intel, Apple, and FedEx. Last year alone, SBIC\nfacilitated more than $5.5 billion in investment to more than\n1,100 high-growth companies across the country, at zero cost to\nthe American taxpayers. This funding is vital because\ntraditional venture capital is overwhelmingly concentrated in\nurban centers in New York, Massachusetts, and California, with\nless than 1 percent of all venture capital going to businesses\nin rural communities.\nThe lack of diversity is not just geographical. Around 2\npercent of venture capital goes to women-owned businesses, and\nonly 1 percent goes to black- and Hispanic-owned businesses.\nThat is not acceptable.\nThere are businesses in every community throughout America\nthat could achieve growth if only they had the capital, and\nthat is why we need the SBIC program.\nConsider, for example, Zentech Manufacturing, a Baltimore\ncompany that designs and builds high-tech circuit boards,\ncables, and other parts for companies in the defense and\nmedical technology industries. When Zentech needed capital to\nprevent a takeover that would have shut down the company in\nMaryland and shipped dozens of jobs overseas, an SBIC fund was\nthe only entity that could provide the type of capital Zentech\nneeded.\nSince then, the company has increased its workforce by more\nthan 60 percent and has successfully competed against overseas\ncompanies for contracts, reassuring manufacturing jobs here in\nthe United States. These are well-paid jobs that are lifting\nfamilies into the middle class.\nThe simple truth is that traditional venture capital\nindustry is doing an inadequate job of directing capital to\ncommunities most in need, and companies like Zentech are\nmissing out on the opportunities for growth and job creation as\na result.\nThe SBIC program fills a very wide gap in traditional\nventure capital markets. But more importantly, SBIC is a good\ninvestment for the taxpayers. According to the 2017 Library of\nCongress report, SBIC creates one job for every $35 spent\nadministering the program, and SBIC investments support\nminority- and women-owned businesses more than twice as often\nas traditional venture capital. That is not enough, but at\nleast it is better.\nWhile SBIC does is a better job of reaching underserved\ncommunities, we still have to do a lot more. Our focus today\nmust be on how we can take the SBIC program from a good program\nto a great program, a more inclusive program that reaches\nunderserved communities frozen out of the traditional venture\ncapital markets.\nWe can begin by exploring how to build a pipeline of\ndiverse investors into the SBIC program, because we know that\nracially and gender-diverse SBIC funds investment more\nfrequently in minority- and women-owned businesses. We also\nneed common-sense reforms to make the SBIC program more\nattractive to investors and more efficient for those who run\nSBIC funds, especially expediting the licensing process.\nThese are some steps that will significantly improve the\nSBIC program as well as create jobs and value in communities\nnationwide. So I am looking forward to the discussion we have\ntoday, how we can improve the SBIC program, and the role that\nthis Committee can play in facilitating those changes.\nChairman Rubio. Thank you. Our first panel is one witness.\nJoseph Shepard is the Associate Administrator of the Office of\nInvestment and Innovation at the Small Business Administration.\nHe held the same position in the Administration of former\nPresident George W. Bush.\nMr. Shepard, thank you for being here. We will begin with\nyour testimony, and again, our apologies.\nSTATEMENT OF JOSEPH SHEPARD, ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR, OFFICE OF\nINVESTMENT AND INNOVATION, U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION,\nWASHINGTON, DC\nMr. Shepard. Good. Good. Thank you, both, Chairman Rubio,\nthank you, and Ranking Member Cardin, thank you as well, and\nmembers of the Committee who will join us later, I am sure. I\nappreciate the opportunity to be here before you and discuss\nthe reauthorization of SBA's Small Business Investment Company,\nor SBIC, program.\nI have spent a great deal of my private equity career in\nand around the SBIC program. In addition to having worked for\nan SBIC, several of my mentors were trained in SBICs, and from\nthem I learned much of my on-the-job training and due\ndiligence, financial analysis, investment structure, and\ntransaction processing.\nPrior to assuming my current position at SBA on March 22,\n2017, the SBIC program's capital-at-risk increased 1.8 times\nfrom $7.9 billion as of September 30, 2010, to $14.2 billion as\nof December 31, 2016. During this time, the SBA did not keep\npace with this growth in areas such as technology,\nexaminations, risk, SBIC program costs, and personnel.\nDuring my time at SBA, I have worked with the SBA team to\nidentify challenges faced by the SBIC program, and together we\nhave been endeavoring to modernize the program and make\nimprovements. During this time, I have enjoyed the support and\nleadership of former administrator Linda McMahon, and I greatly\nappreciate the hard work of the SBIC program team and all my\ncolleagues at the SBA.\nFollowing is a brief summary of the select improvements\nthat we have made within the SBIC program.\nThere have been no major technology improvements to the\nSBIC program since 1994. Since my arrival at SBA, it has been a\npriority of mine to modernize the SBIC program's information\ntechnology infrastructure. During the past two years, we have\ntransitioned the legacy SBIC Web data collection system to\nSBA's Office of the Chief Information Officer, conducted an\nextensive review of the SBIC program's existing technology,\nprocured a new software platform, and this year began the\nconfiguration of the new software. The implementation of this\nnew software platform will allow the SBA to improve the\ninformation associated with the SBIC program and dramatically\nimprove the SBA's data security, risk management and oversight\ncapabilities.\nPrior to my arrival, challenges associated with the SBIC\nexaminations were present, as a result of issues and practices\nprior to fiscal year 2017. A 2013 SBA Inspector General report\nhad also identified deficiencies in the management of the SBIC\nexamination process.\nStatute requires that SBICs be examined at least every two\nyears. SBA began fiscal year 2017 with an estimated 56.9\npercent of SBICs in statutory compliance. In fiscal year 2017,\nI recommended and then implemented an examination surge. Today,\nstatutory compliance has improved dramatically and is now at\n100 percent.\nAdditionally, to better mitigate current and future credit\nrisk in the SBIC program, the SBA enhanced its credit standard\nto require that all SBICs with SBA guaranteed leverage be\nexamined within an 18-month time period.\nIn fiscal year 2018, I initiated the creation of a new\neconometric subsidy model to replace the SBA's 27-year-old\nmodel. The result is an improved subsidy model that is\nreflective of the inherent risks associated with present-day\nprivate equity investing, and we believe will more accurately\nproject future losses and long-term costs of the current SBIC\nprogram to taxpayers.\nThe SBIC program also has a total operating cost each year\nthat is not covered by subsidy. SBA's total cost to operate the\nSBIC program during fiscal year 2018 was $27.3 million. Since\nmy arrival we have focused on ways to reduce taxpayer costs\nassociated with SBIC program expenses.\nIn 2017, SBA increased licensing fees paid by SBIC\napplicants and examination fees paid by operating SBICs. Both\nfees had not been increased since 1996.\nFinally, the SBIC program's workforce needs to evolve.\nApproximately 31 percent of the program's current position\ndescriptions are 15 years or older, and 41 percent are 7 to 13-\nyears-old. The oldest position description is 22 years old and\nwas last revised in 1997. A contractor has been engaged to\nassist us in revising all outdated position descriptions. SBA\nwill continue to hire additional staff and fill current future\nvacancies. New positions are also being created and filled,\nincluding an IT project manager, IT data scientist, senior\nexaminer, senior risk and investment policy officer, and an\ninvestment accounting and analytics officer. I am committed to\nhiring for an organization that can support the program of the\nfuture.\nIn conclusion, actions taken over the last two years have\nimproved the SBIC program. Many of these changes and\nimprovements are generational in nature with no previous such\nimprovements occurring since the 1990s or for the past 20\nyears. As a result, the SBIC program is in a better position\ntoday to face the challenges of the future.\nThank you.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Shepard follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nChairman Rubio. Thank you. Mr. Shepard, I want to begin my\nquestions by--I want to read you the statement of policy of the\nSmall Business Investment Act. It is the law that created this.\nIn creating this program, this is what Congress stated as its\nintent.\nHere is a quote: ``Stimulate and supplement the flow of\nprivate equity capital and long-term loan funds which small\nbusiness concerns need for the sound financing of their\nbusiness operations and for their growth, expansion, and\nmodernization, and which are not available in adequate\nsupply.'' End quote. That is the stated intent.\nIt seems to me that Congress made clear when they passed\nit, and it is reiterated in many reforms to the law, that the\nintent of the SBIC program is to provide patient capital to\nsmall businesses that private financial markets do not\notherwise provide.\nSo let me ask, do you agree with Congress' enacted law and\nstated intent----\nMr. Shepard. Oh, absolutely.\nChairman Rubio [continuing]. The goal of the--well, do you\nagree that the intent--let me just ask it this way. Do you\nagree that the law and the stated intent is to supplement the\nprivate market by increasing the flow of long-term funds to\nsmall businesses?\nMr. Shepard. Yes.\nChairman Rubio. Okay. Because in your testimony you implied\nthat risk has increased in recent years, or at least has been\nundervalued, making necessary and update of the subsidy model\nSBA uses for the SBIC program. So, for example, you say that\nfrom fiscal year 2010 to 2018, the program experienced charge-\noffs where SBA expenditures on loans have defaulted, of $281\nmillion for the debenture program.\nAs you are aware, charge-off costs are not the only payment\nfactor in the program. The SBA can recover assets on loans that\nhave defaulted. They can charge fees on operating loans to\ncover costs.\nIs it not it true that during the same period the SBIC\ndebenture program operated on a zero-subsidy basis?\nMr. Shepard. That is correct, yes.\nChairman Rubio. And is it also true that during this period\nthe fees the SBA charges on the debenture SBIC program has been\nlower than the historical average?\nMr. Shepard. Yes, absolutely. That is correct.\nChairman Rubio. So you say in your testimony that upon your\ninitiative, the SBA will begin to use a new econometric model\nto calculate its costs, that the model will include new\nassumptions like macroeconomic factors, private equity\nelements, private equity fund characteristics.\nYou answered the first question agreeing, right, that the\npurpose of this is to provide funding that private market was\nnot meeting. One of the purposes of the SBIC program is to fix\nthat market failure, to increase the long-term patient capital\nthat goes into small businesses, which would not be made\navailable without the program.\nIt is true, I think you would agree, that part of achieving\nthis purpose is investing in small businesses that are\nthemselves investing in innovations and new products which are,\nby definition, more uncertain investments than what the private\nmarket writ large has to offer.\nMr. Shepard. Right.\nChairman Rubio. So will the assumptions you have added to\nthe historical model SBA has used, will it increase or decrease\nthe time horizon of capital financing for these small\nbusinesses?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. Thank you for--good question, Chairman. I\nthank you for the question. The intent of the subsidy model,\nthat will not impact the disbursement of capital. The intent\nthere, and with a lot of the things that I mentioned in the\nopening comment, were generational, things that have not been\nfixed, getting the program ready for the future, getting it\nready for whatever may come.\nWe looked at the subsidy model and we looked at how the\nportfolio was constructed, currently about $15 billion, and its\nmove into more equity-oriented investments. When the model was\nbuilt it was more debt-oriented, so I wanted to make sure--and\nwe, as a team, wanted to make sure that we were accounting for\nfuture losses, and let's have a better model in place so as to\nstewards the taxpayer dollars we do not experience loss in the\nfuture. That was the intent.\nChairman Rubio. You agree the metrics, the private\nfinancial markets are used, are more short-term, or sorry. I\nguess, let me ask you, are the metrics the private market uses\nmore short-term or long-term in their views than the current\nSBA model?\nMr. Shepard. I think they are similar. I think a lot of the\ninvesting activity that takes place in the SBIC model, the\nmajority of it is subordinated debt of mezzanine, and it has\ngot, you know, a maybe 3-, 5-, 7-year time horizon, very\nsimilar to the private sector. So I do not feel like there is a\ndisconnect there, by any means.\nChairman Rubio. Well, and which private equity elements\nwill be used in assessing the default risk of--say there is a\ncompany that is developing a new cancer drug or a\ntelecommunications equipment that can compete with Huawei. And\nwould private equity elements investment in small business\ntaking on these challenges without an SBIC program?\nMr. Shepard. Well, to the subsidy model, we will be working\nwith OMB. The implementation will occur in 2021. We are\nreviewing those right now, in terms of what those will be. They\nwill be more macroeconomic in terms of trying to anticipate\nmacroeconomic factors in our economy. And so it will be less\noriented toward specific industries and more oriented toward\nthe economy as a whole.\nChairman Rubio. Well, I guess my last question--and I am\ngoing to turn it over to the Ranking Member--in developing the\nmodel, have you considered the shortfalls of equity valuation\nmethods like the capital asset pricing model or others that are\ncommonly used in the private markets, and undervaluing the\ndevelopment of long-term innovative product?\nAs an example, which investment would capital asset pricing\nmodel more highly value, buying a share in an index fund in the\nS&P 500 or taking an equity stake in a company that, for\nexample, is making new agricultural machinery to pick crops\nlike strawberries in Florida that have been done manually? So\ndo you take into account, in the model, the well-established\nshortfalls of this valuation method?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. We are going to need to do that, without\nquestion.\nChairman Rubio. Thank you. Ranking Member.\nSenator Cardin. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for being\nhere and for your service. You heard in my opening statement\nthe concern I raised about opportunities in the traditional\nventure capital markets for women-owned businesses and minority\nbusinesses. And then I cited the SBIC numbers, which are twice\nas strong but still, I hope we all would agree, unacceptable.\nSo what are your recommendations for how we can have a more\ndiverse use of the SBIC funds and use it to help particularly\nwomen- and minority-owned businesses?\nMr. Shepard. Right. Well, you know, I publicly stated\nbefore that, as the Chairman read, looking for areas in the\nintent and the mission of the SBIC program, to look for areas\nwhere there is not an adequate supply of capital, and certainly\nwomen, veterans, minorities, rural areas hit all of those\nareas. And I would say, as you look at our numbers, and as we\nhave talked in the past, they are anemic in the impact that the\nprogram has had in a lot of those areas. Much room for\nimprovement.\nAnd so I could not agree more that there is more that we\nshould do and need to do. I will note that SBA invests and\nbacks the capital that goes to the SBIC, and the SBIC\ninvestment managers are the ones who make those investments.\nSenator Cardin. I understand that completely. So how do we\nget--and that is why I said I think the key is to get more SBIC\ninvestors that are diverse, that represent diverse communities,\nincluding rural communities. How do we go about doing that?\nMr. Shepard. I think what we have got to do is we have got\nto back up and look at the licensing phase, and make\ndeterminations about what kind of SBICs are going to be\nlicensed and what plan are they going to put before the SBA, in\nterms of where their focus is going to be. Are you going to\nfocus in women and minority areas? Are you going to focus in\nrural areas? And we have got to make the determinations there\nand then keep them on plan once they get into the marketplace,\nif they successfully get an SBA license.\nAnd I would look forward to working with your team to talk\nabout--and the Committee--to talk about how can we do that? How\ncan we do that inside the SBA to make that happen?\nSenator Cardin. So for entrepreneur development we have\nspecial programs to try to help our veterans, to help women. Do\nwe need a similar program for the SBIC?\nMr. Shepard. I think we could certainly do it within the\ncurrent framework, but again, it begins in how do we license\nand who are we licensing to?\nSenator Cardin. So let me get to the licensing issue here,\nbecause I know that Chairman Risch, when he was Chairman of the\nCommittee, held a hearing that dealt with the concerns about\nthe length of time on the licensures, the complications. We\nhave been told a lot of potential licensees decide not to go\nthrough the process because they think it just takes too long,\nand that, at least the information that we have, it is getting\nworse rather than better, as far as the process itself for\nlicensure. The numbers of SBIC licenses that have been granted\nhas gone down.\nSo how do you streamline the license process to encourage\nmore investors but also do it in a way that recruits in\nunderserved communities?\nMr. Shepard. Right. Well, the technology improvements that\nI have talked about are certainly going to help. We are\nhopeful, by the end of the summer--by the end of the fiscal\nyear we will have implemented what we are calling the licensing\ntracker. So that should help us streamline and make our process\nmore efficient. So that is one way, from a technology\nstandpoint.\nWhen we have more startup, first-time small business\ninvestment companies, and we have seen an uptick in those, it\ndoes take a little longer to vet those. In the private sector\nit take anywhere from a year to two years. We are nowhere near\nthat timeframe. We do a much better job. But there is always\nroom for improvement. And so do we add more people? I am taking\ncare of the technology standpoint. So that speaks to process\nand improving the process and having a better process in place.\nIn terms of how do we get participants that are going to\ninvest in some of these areas you have mentioned, we are going\nto have to do that by encouraging those people to come in, and\nagain, are there ways to do that? Do we do that through\nregulation? Do we do that through statute? I think those are\nconversations that we need to have about the best way to impact\nthe few, if you will, to impact those applicants that are\ncoming in to invest in those types of small businesses.\nSo let me ask you one last question dealing with early\nstage investments, because that would also target more to\nunderserved communities if we had early stage investment. The\nprogram we did start was terminated, I believe for the reason\nthat it was claimed not to be cost-effective. Does this need\nstill exist, and how do we make it cost-effective?\nMr. Shepard. Well, that was one of the reasons. There also\nwas not a high degree of interest. A lot of it was the way the\ncurrent program is built, is the majority of the funds that\ncome in are subordinated debt or mezzanine. They are investing\nin operating companies that have existing cash flows that can\nservice that debt that they are borrowing through the SBA\nguarantee. And so they are not early stage or seed companies.\nAnd so that is what you are seeing in the portfolio right\nnow, if you will. That is what you are seeing in the SBIC.\nSenator Cardin. But would not early stage investment have a\ntendency to reach more of the underserved areas that are more\nwomen, more minorities, more rural?\nMr. Shepard. Certainly startups and certainly early stage,\nand one other thing is we do have unleveraged small business\ninvestment companies. The majority of those do invest in early\nstage. They are welcome to come into the program at any time,\nbecause it is not a credit risk to the government. It is not a\ncredit risk to the SBA. So they do come in to get the license,\nand many of them do invest in that area.\nSenator Cardin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Rubio. Senator Romney.\nSenator Romney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member.\nI appreciate the focus on this Committee on building our\neconomy and providing opportunities for all our citizens.\nI am interested in understanding just where it is in the\nentire spectrum of investment that this investment activity\nthat you carry out is playing a meaningful role. I do recognize\nthat there is an underrepresentation in the private equity and\nventure capital world in businesses that are led by or founded\nby minorities and women. Having worked in that industry for\nsome time, I would note that in my own experience very few of\nthe people that came to us with proposals were minorities or\nwomen, although we did invest in a number. Meg Whitman at FTD,\nJudy George at Domain, and Linda Mason at Bright Horizons. And\nlike most, some were successful and some were not.\nI do know that in the industry there is more money chasing\ndeals than there are good deals, and my experience is that,\nwell, at least from firms I knew, we would have invested in a\nMartian if we thought we could make money at it. So it was not\nthat we were afraid of investing with a particular type of\nAmerican. We just wanted the best deal we could possibly find\nthat made a bunch of money for our investors, and, ultimately,\nfor ourselves.\nGiven the fact that there is so much money in private\nequity today, billions upon billions, and so much money in\nventure capital, with SoftBank and others that are just\nflooding the market, where are the gaps where the private\nmarket is not reaching, that this investment activity on the\npart of the SBA is reaching?\nWhy do you exist, if you will, in this investment activity\nas opposed to just turning to the private market? Where are the\ngaps? Where are the places that you feel you need to play a\nrole? Is it with regards to minority opportunities? Is it with\nregards to investing in things that have social values that may\nnot have the high enough return to justify a standard venture\ncapital investors? Is it a certain region of the country? Are\nyou playing a redundant role that can be filled by the private\nsector, or are there really areas that you are filling that\nwould not be filled otherwise?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. Senator Romney, thank you for your\nquestion. I will say that the small business investment\ncompanies are certainly internal-rate-of-return driven. They\nare trying to return to their limited partners a certain retain\nthat has been promised to them, and then return the capital\nback to the SBA, that has been borrowed from the SBA. So their\nincentive is often return-based as opposed to based on\ninvesting in certain types of businesses. It maybe women-,\nminority-, veteran-owned, or geographic as well, in terms of\nrural investing. We would need to make some modifications to\nthe program to incentivize that investment activity, otherwise,\nthan its current state.\nIn terms of gaps, we need more information, and I am\nworking on getting a study together, hopefully beginning early\nin 2020, that will specifically address that issue, because we\nhave a concern about it as well, and where in the marketplace\nis the need? I will tell you that in 1999, the program size was\nabout $3 billion. It is now close to $15 billion. But there is\na component of that portfolio that are business development\ncompanies, for example. They are now at about $3 billion. It is\na pretty large concentration of the portfolio. It is between 20\nand 25 percent. And the majority of those publicly traded\ncompanies do provide unitranche debt, which is also senior\ndebt.\nAnd so there are certainly places where you can look at the\nportfolio and you can look at the activity and you can see\ncompetition with the free enterprise system. And the intent, of\ncourse, is to provide capital in those areas where there is not\nan adequate supply and not be competitive.\nAnd so not a great answer, because there are some unknowns,\nand we need to have some more information to define that\nbetter.\nSenator Romney. I would just note that I would think, in\ntraditional venture capital and private equity, that there\nreally is not a need for the government to participate and to,\nif you will, juice or leverage the returns that are available\nto private investors and private funds, that the reason for\nthis activity potentially being supported by Congress and by\nour government and taxpayers is if it is focused on addressing\na particular area where the need is not being met, where the\nprivate market is not reaching.\nAnd if the private market is effectively reaching every\narea then there is no particular reason for the taxpayer to\nsubsidize returns to private equity and venture capital funds.\nAnd even then, even if there are gaps, one would have to ask,\nare we better trying to find ways to get the people that live\nin those gaps, or the individuals that are affected by those\ngap areas, to have better access to the private markets, or\nshould government step in?\nSo these are, I think, real questions that I hope we will\nbe able to answer.\nMr. Shepard. Right. And one other thing I will add, we are\ncertainly, as you have mentioned, at an all-time high, in terms\nof private equity, close to $3 trillion, and maybe have\nsurpassed that, private equity-based in the United States. And\nwe have seen a decline in licensing activity because there is\nsuch an opportunity to raise capital in the private markets\nwith LPs there, and I think that is part of the reason we have\nseen a steady decline of fewer SBICs, because they have been\nable to access that capital a different way.\nSenator Romney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Rubio. Senator Cantwell.\nSenator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you\nagain for introducing legislation that is topical today to fix\nthis problem as it relates to women-owned businesses being\npenalized if they actually have equity investment from being\nable to participate in the SBA program. So I am assuming that\nyou agree that that is a good solution to fixing that problem.\nMr. Shepard. I am not sure what.\nSenator Cantwell. So currently if you are a woman-owned\nbusiness and you receive equity investment, they are saying\nthat that counts against your minority ownership. Look, we have\na major problem in America that women are underrepresented in\nour economy, and there are lots of reasons for that, but we\nneed to work a lot harder on this Committee to make sure that\naccess to capital, technical and skilled training, barriers\nthat are inhibitors to that, we change the law to allow women-\nowned businesses to be sole-source, contract-approved at the\nFederal level. For the first time, Federal Government made\ntheir threshold numbers. So capital importance of opportunity,\nthe Women's Centers, all these things are important to bringing\nup that number, which is a very low number.\nFrankly, my colleague, Senator Shaheen, and I, we like\nwomen as women-owned businesses because chances are they create\nproducts that we like and they are more geared toward the\nthings that we are interested in.\nBut the bottom line is we need half of our economy to be\nmore entrepreneurial, and to do that they have to have access\nto capital and changing this law so they are not penalized.\nThat was my question. Do you believe that we should continue to\nhelp women-owned businesses not be penalized under the Federal\nlaw?\nMr. Shepard. Absolutely. That should not be a barrier to\nentry in our economy, by any means.\nSenator Cantwell. And you support the Women Business\nCenters?\nMr. Shepard. Absolutely. They are a great product and one\nof the good things we have at SBA.\nSenator Cantwell. And do you agree that they are key tools,\nbecause again, part of some of the other programs that we have,\nagain, have been oriented more toward a lot of retired CEOs,\nand that is great, but again, women come in to pitch them on an\nidea that they have, and they do not have familiarity with what\nthe women are talking about--the market, the product, the\nsolution. And so the Women Business Centers of the SBA helps\nfund a really key tool for somebody to just show up in a\ncommunity and go, ``Where do I get started?''\nMr. Shepard. I agree. My mother was an entrepreneur when I\nwas young, and she could have really used those. And so there\nare a lot of women today benefiting from that Small Business\nAdministration resource, and it is a wonderful thing we have.\nSenator Cantwell. And the other thing we have figured out\nis they do not want to borrow as much as the guys want to\nborrow. They are just a little more--they did not want to\nborrow, you know, $500,000. They wanted to borrow smaller loan\namounts, so also achieving that.\nBut I want to, again, thank Chairman Rubio for co-\nsponsoring this legislation. I am hoping our colleagues will\nhelp support this so that that private sector investment will\nnot penalize women ownership from getting access to these\nFederal programs.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Rubio. Senator Kennedy.\nSenator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you--what\ndo I call you, Commissioner Shepard?\nMr. Shepard. Associate Administrator.\nSenator Kennedy. Administrator.\nMr. Shepard. Associate Administrator Shepard.\nSenator Kennedy. Okay. Thanks for being here today.\nMr. Shepard. Thank you, Senator Kennedy.\nSenator Kennedy. Why don't you like SBICs?\nMr. Shepard. I actually do.\nSenator Kennedy. Well, you know, one of the things that I\nhave learned since I have been up here--I have not been up here\nfor a while--but you have to watch what people do, not what\nthey say.\nMr. Shepard. Right.\nSenator Kennedy. So you have been Associate Director I\nthink two terms.\nMr. Shepard. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. And you are--while you are in office, the\naverage number of SBICs approved is 11.\nMr. Shepard. Mm-hmm.\nSenator Kennedy. When you are out of office, the average is\ndouble that.\nMr. Shepard. Mm-hmm.\nSenator Kennedy. That tells me you do not like them.\nMr. Shepard. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. Why is that?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. I do. I think in the Bush administration\nI was in that position for a little over a year----\nSenator Kennedy. Yes, and you averaged 11.\nMr. Shepard [continuing]. And we had the Great Recession,\nand we had a lot of funds that----\nSenator Kennedy. And you are averaging 11 now.\nMr. Shepard. And--and----\nSenator Kennedy. And the normal is 20.\nMr. Shepard. Mm-hmm.\nSenator Kennedy. I mean, if I am a small business woman or\nman, and let's say I have got an $8 million company----\nMr. Shepard. Right.\nSenator Kennedy [continuing]. But I have got promising new\nsoftware, and I go to SoftBank or Sequoia Capital and ask for\nmoney, they are not going to even see me, are they?\nMr. Shepard. Right. Right. Probably not. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. Okay?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. That is the purpose of an SBIC. Correct?\nMr. Shepard. Mm-hmm. In many instances, yes.\nSenator Kennedy. So let me ask you again, why don't you\nlike them?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. Yes. Well, I do. I absolutely do.\nSenator Kennedy. Well, then why don't you approve them?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. Well, we have been approving them.\nSenator Kennedy. Not very quickly.\nMr. Shepard. We are doing--we are doing as good a job as we\ncan. We can always do better.\nSenator Kennedy. Do you need more people, or do you----\nMr. Shepard. We may need--we may need more people.\nSenator Kennedy [continuing]. Or do your people just--I\nmean, it is not only that you are not approving them--and I am\nnot suggesting that your analysis should not be rigorous----\nMr. Shepard. Yes, sure.\nSenator Kennedy [continuing]. But when you are not in\noffice----\nMr. Shepard. Right.\nSenator Kennedy [continuing]. It seems to go much more\nquickly.\nMr. Shepard. Mm-hmm.\nSenator Kennedy. And it is not just the denial, it is the\ndelay.\nMr. Shepard. Right.\nSenator Kennedy. That is what most people hate about\ngovernment. It is the stall and restall.\nMr. Shepard. Sure.\nSenator Kennedy. I mean, if you continue going at the pace\nyou are going, the average age of your applicants for an SBIC\nlicense----\nMr. Shepard. Right.\nSenator Kennedy [continuing]. Is going to be deceased.\nMr. Shepard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. So what is the problem?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. Yes. Well, I think, you know, last year\nwe licensed 25, and we had a period of time where we actually\nlicensed faster than we had ever done before, in 5.1 months. We\nhad a lot of subsequent funds, so we licensed faster.\nWe are seeing more startup funds or new funds. Those take a\nlittle longer to process, and so that extends our licensing\ntime from five months to, say, seven months.\nSenator Kennedy. Well, but, isn't there a--I am sorry for\ninterrupting you but I have only got 5 minutes.\nMr. Shepard. Sure. Sure. I understand.\nSenator Kennedy. Rubio is tough.\nMr. Shepard. Yes, sir.\nSenator Kennedy. He is tough.\nMr. Shepard. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. But if you have got a brand-new license\napplication, but you have a lot of folks who have had one\nSBIC----\nMr. Shepard. Correct. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy [continuing]. And they are applying for a\nsecond one----\nMr. Shepard. Right.\nSenator Kennedy [continuing]. It would seem to me that the\nsecond one should go more quickly.\nMr. Shepard. We can move them faster.\nSenator Kennedy. No, you do not. No, you do not.\nMr. Shepard. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. It takes just as long, and in some cases,\nlonger, and I do not get it.\nMr. Shepard. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. I mean, to me there is a--yes, there is a\nlot of venture capital out there. There is venture capital all\nover hell and half of Georgia.\nMr. Shepard. Yes. Sure.\nSenator Kennedy. But unless you are a big girl or a big\nboy, you are not going to have access to any of it.\nMr. Shepard. Right.\nSenator Kennedy. That is what the SBIC is for.\nMr. Shepard. Right.\nSenator Kennedy. That is your job.\nMr. Shepard. Yes. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. Not once I do get an answer out of you\nguys, you just say, ``Denied,'' and I say, ``Why?''\nMr. Shepard. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. And you say, ``If I told you, I would have\nto kill you.''\nMr. Shepard. Yes. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. Why don't you tell people why you are\nlying to them?\nMr. Shepard. Well, we do.\nSenator Kennedy. No, you do not.\nMr. Shepard. We have----\nSenator Kennedy. Why isn't there an appeals process?\nMr. Shepard [continuing]. We--we--we have not had any\ndenials at the agency committee level.\nSenator Kennedy. Yes. It is because you do not give them an\nanswer.\nMr. Shepard. Well, we----\nSenator Kennedy. It is because you stall them and restall\nthem.\nMr. Shepard. Well, we--we--we answer them as quickly as\npossible at that level, and we have approved several at that\nlevel, and we have not had a lot of denials there. I think one\nof the things to keep in mind is we cannot force capital\nformation. They have to decide to apply----\nSenator Kennedy. Okay.\nMr. Shepard [continuing]. And----\nSenator Kennedy. I am about to run out of time and I want\nto land this plane on time.\nMr. Shepard. Understood.\nSenator Kennedy. Mr. Shepard, I do not know you. I know you\nare a fine person.\nMr. Shepard. Mm-hmm.\nSenator Kennedy. I do not think you like SBICs. Either that\nor you have got folks who just are not competent.\nMr. Shepard. Okay.\nSenator Kennedy. I think applicants deserve an answer when\nthey are denied. I think you should tell them why. I think that\nif you really do not support SBICs you are in the wrong job.\nMr. Shepard. Right. Understood. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. And it does not look to me like, based on\nyour behavior, you support them.\nMr. Shepard. OK.\nSenator Kennedy. Now I am not telling you, do not be\nrigorous in your analysis.\nMr. Shepard. Understood. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. This is taxpayer money.\nMr. Shepard. Right.\nSenator Kennedy. But I am telling you, I am suggesting to\nyou, if you have a bias against SBICs, you ought to go run for\nthe Senate or something.\nMr. Shepard. Right. Right.\nSenator Kennedy. But you should not be doing what you are\ndoing.\nMr. Shepard. Right. Well, I do like the program and would\nlook forward to visiting more with your staff about some of\nthese instances, and making sure that we clarify some things.\nSenator Kennedy. Thank you for your service.\nMr. Shepard. Thank you very much.\nChairman Rubio. Before I turn it over to Senator Shaheen I\nwant to just take on that, because I do not want to forget to\nbring it up. When we talked about the new models that you are\ngoing to be using to calculate the costs, it is going to\ninclude assumptions--I read them out already--macroeconomic\nfactors, private equity elements, private equity fund\ncharacteristics. And you initiated this new model.\nAre these assumptions that you are coming up with, are\nthose required by the Federal Credit Reform Act or the Office\nof Management and Budget?\nMr. Shepard. The Federal Credit Reform Act does speak to\nthe fact that you should have a model, that underlying model\nthat mimics the type of investment activity. And so that is\nwhat we are trying to do with this Federal Credit Program.\nChairman Rubio. Right. But the FCRA and the OMB only\nrequire the use of Treasury discount rates.\nMr. Shepard. Mm-hmm.\nChairman Rubio. That is the only ones they require. So\nthese are ones you chose.\nMr. Shepard. We are working on selecting them. They have\nnot been selected yet.\nChairman Rubio. But those are the ones you are leaning\ntoward choosing or using, correct?\nMr. Shepard. Yes, sir. Correct. And we will vet that with\nOMB and make sure that it is done right. There is no question\nabout that.\nChairman Rubio. Yes, and I guess, building on what Senator\nKennedy's question was, how is this evaluation of the program\nnot you substituting your own priorities for those that\nCongress has laid out?\nMr. Shepard. Oh, and it is not intended to be a\nsubstitution, by any means, Chairman. It is intended to do a\nbetter job of making sure that we secure taxpayer dollars and\nthat we do not have losses. So it is trying to improve the\nprogram to make it better from a loss standpoint.\nChairman Rubio. Senator Shaheen.\nSenator Shaheen. Well, just--my time needs to go back up to\nfive minutes.\nChairman Rubio. I do not even look at it so you can go\nahead. I do--only for Kennedy do I look at the time. Everybody\nelse----\nSenator Kennedy. You better watch Rubio.\nSenator Shaheen. I know. Really. Just to be clear, so that\nI understand what your response was to Senator Rubio, I\nunderstood you to say that the criteria that you have laid out\nare not criteria that are required by the law. Is that correct?\nMr. Shepard. I--we have--I am not sure about that. We have\nactually----\nSenator Shaheen. Well, can you get an answer for this\nCommittee?\nMr. Shepard. I absolutely can. Yes. Yes, ma'am.\nSenator Shaheen. Mr. Chairman, if you could share that\nanswer as soon as we get it, I would appreciate it.\nChairman Rubio. Sure. I think we know the answer but we are\nmore than happy to hear what----\nSenator Shaheen. I agree.\nMr. Shepard. Thank you.\nSenator Shaheen. So I guess I have to say, Mr. Shepard, I\nfound your responses to Senator Kennedy totally unacceptable,\nbecause the SBA's statistics show that the average licensing\ntimeline for SBICs rose to 8.2 months in 2017, from 5.1 months\nin 2016, and that the program has led new license requests to\ndecline from 29 in 2017, to just 17 in 2018.\nSo again, I do not know what has caused this, but I know\nthat you are in charge, and that the program is going in the\nwrong direction.\nMr. Shepard. Mm-hmm.\nSenator Shaheen. So I think it is incumbent on you to find\nout what is causing the decline in license requests and the\nincreasing timeline, so that we can fix that.\nMr. Shepard. Correct. Yes.\nSenator Shaheen. Because I agree with Senator Cantwell. As\nI have traveled around and looked at what is happening in the\neconomy right now, one of the things that we know is that\nwomen-owned businesses are increasing much more dramatically\nthan other businesses, women- and minority-owned businesses,\nand that they are employing people at a greater rate. And we\nalso know that women-owned businesses have a much harder time\ngetting access to capital.\nAnd so I guess what I want to know is what is SBA doing to\nmake clear to women and minorities that the SBIC program is\navailable to help reduce barriers to new entrants. So what are\nyou doing to reach out to women and minorities to ensure that\nthey understand that SBIC is something that they can\nparticipate in as well?\nMr. Shepard. Right. Well, there are two answers. The Small\nBusiness Investment Companies who actually make the investments\nare the ones that would be having the majority of the dialog\nwith those women-owned businesses and making investment\ndecisions about whether they are going to invest in them or\nnot.\nOn our side, in terms of licensing, it would be making sure\nthat the female fund investors can invest, using SBIC as a\nvehicle for an investment fund. And we have a few, but as I\nmentioned, Senator Cardin, we need more, and we do not have an\nissue with that at all. We just do not have very many female\nprospective fund managers that come in seeking an SBA license\nto operate an SBIC.\nSenator Shaheen. And so are there things that you think SBA\nmight do to encourage more women and minorities to be able to\ndo that?\nMr. Shepard. I think we could certainly improve in that\narea. Yes, ma'am.\nSenator Shaheen. And what kinds of things do you think\nmight be possible for SBA to do?\nMr. Shepard. I think we could maybe use some of our other\npartners within the SBA to communicate that message better, and\nalso use our education team that we have in-house within the\nSBIC program to have better outreach to those groups and those\nentities.\nSenator Shaheen. Well, I would certainly encourage you to\ndo that----\nMr. Shepard. I appreciate that.\nSenator Shaheen [continuing]. Because as we look at where\njob creation is happening, there are tremendous opportunities\nthere. And so I hope SBA will encourage the SBIC program to be\nmore inclusive.\nMr. Shepard. Yes, ma'am.\nSenator Shaheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Rubio. Seven minutes left. You did not need the\nreset.\nSenator Hawley.\nSenator Hawley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Shepard, I\nhave got to be honest with you. My office has heard a lot of\ncomplaints from SBICs about your process, and to be frank with\nyou about your leadership. And so like other members of this\nCommittee I think I am trying to get to the bottom of this. But\nwhen I say ``a lot,'' I mean a lot.\nSo was the SBIC approval process inadequate before you came\nto office? I mean, is that the issue here, that you have had to\nclean up? Is your position that we are approving way too many\nof these, and the whole thing needed to be overhauled?\nMr. Shepard. Not at all. I mean, there are certainly\nimprovements that need to be made, and I have put those in the\nwritten testimony, and before you got here talked a little bit\nabout some of those enhancements and improvements. But the\nintent is to make the program better and to streamline.\nSenator Hawley. So that explains why there has been a 50\npercent reduction in the approvals, in the way that Senator\nKennedy was asking?\nMr. Shepard. Just the processes alone should not account\nfor that. I think----\nSenator Hawley. So do you know--how many staff are in your\noffice?\nMr. Shepard. Total? We have got 82 is our count.\nSenator Hawley. So how many staff vacancies are in the\noffice?\nMr. Shepard. We have got 11. Eight are in the process of\nrecruitment and three are about ready to be recruited.\nSenator Hawley. What about senior management positions? Do\nyou have any of those that are unfilled?\nMr. Shepard. We have a deputy position that needs to be\nfilled. That is the only senior management.\nSenator Hawley. You know, a major complaint from the SBIC\nis the time it is taking to process applications, schedule\ninterviews, classes, even doing something as simple as actually\nsending a license to the applicant once they have been\napproved. What accounts for that? Are you not adequately\nstaffed? Is your staff not good at their job? I mean, what is\nthe--what are we to believe? What are we to conclude?\nMr. Shepard. Our staff is fantastic at their job, and they\nare wonderful people. And I think more of it, we could\ncertainly look at our personnel and look at our size.\nSenator Hawley. I mean, if your staff is really good at\ntheir job, but the program does not seem to be functioning, and\nthe processes are fine, I mean, what are we left to--I mean,\nwho is the weak link then? I mean, where does that leave us?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. The program has doubled in size, and so\nwe have got a lot more work to do. And so we are certainly--we\ncertainly could look at personnel and driving up those numbers.\nSenator Hawley. Why don't you give applicants who deny the\nopportunity, or who are denied approval, the opportunity to\namend their application, to account for whatever would have\ncaused the denial?\nMr. Shepard. I think unless--unless it is an issue of--\nunless it is some kind of a legal issue, I do not know why we\nwould not do that, and that is something I will look into with\nour team, because they certainly should have an opportunity to\nadjudicate or to come back around and have a fuller discussion.\nSenator Hawley. It just seems strange that after applicants\nspend who knows how many hours--tens, hundreds of thousands of\ndollars, raising millions of dollars in private capital,\nseeking a license, that you do not give them either the\ncourtesy of an explanation, to Senator Kennedy's point, or the\nopportunity to fix their application. I mean, that seems\nstrange to me. Don't you think so?\nMr. Shepard. I would agree, and I need to look into more of\nwhy that may be happening and some of those areas where that is\nhappening.\nSenator Hawley. Let me ask you something else. In December\n2018, Chairman Rubio's Spurring Business in Communities Act\nbecame law. I was not here then but that is an important bill\nto me, because it gives first priority to SBIC applicants who\nare located in under-licensed states like mine, like the State\nof Missouri, and it removes certain capital requirements to\nmake it easier for applicants from underserved states like mine\nto participate in the program.\nSo that was over six months ago. Where are we on\nimplementation?\nMr. Shepard. We are close and we are going to have it done\nby the end of the fiscal year, so in this next quarter.\nSenator Hawley. So when can I expect to see results in\nMissouri small business investment as a result of your\nimplementation?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. I think at the beginning of the next\nfiscal year, starting in that first quarter, we will start\npromoting that and talking about that program.\nSenator Hawley. So you have taken steps toward\nimplementation?\nMr. Shepard. Oh, absolutely.\nSenator Hawley. Yes. For example?\nMr. Shepard. Well, we have taken steps toward finalizing\nthe legislation, and we are starting to plan outreach to talk\nabout and announce it.\nSenator Hawley. Wait. Okay, wait. So you are starting to\nplan outreach. So you have not actually done any\nimplementation?\nMr. Shepard. We have an event in Oklahoma planned in\nAugust, to talk about--to talk about the underserved and the\nunder-licensed.\nSenator Hawley. Okay. So that will be your first event.\nMr. Shepard. Yes, sir.\nSenator Hawley. So so far you have not done anything.\nMr. Shepard. So far what, sir?\nSenator Hawley. So far you have not done anything. You said\nin August. This is June.\nMr. Shepard. Oh, this is outreach, outreach about the\nprogram. We are close to implementation and should have that\ndone in about----\nSenator Hawley. So you have not done any implementation\nyet?\nMr. Shepard. No implementation yet. No, sir.\nSenator Hawley. Okay.\nMr. Shepard. Yes.\nSenator Hawley. You know, are you aware that Committee\nstaff invited several SBIC fund managers to testify here today\nbut none agreed to do so, for fear of reprisal from you?\nMr. Shepard. I did not know that, and that----\nSenator Hawley. Don't you think that is alarming?\nMr. Shepard. It is unfortunate.\nSenator Hawley. What accounts for that?\nMr. Shepard. I do not know. I do not know. That should not\nbe the case, but I do not know.\nSenator Hawley. No, it should not be the case. What should\nwe do about that, do you think?\nMr. Shepard. Yes. I do not know. They should be here. I\nwould like them to be here. I would like us to have a good\nconversation with those SBIC fund managers.\nSenator Hawley. Hm. Have you ever delayed or denied the\nprocessing of an applicant as a form of punishment or reprisal?\nMr. Shepard. Absolutely not.\nSenator Hawley. You are sure about that?\nMr. Shepard. I am pretty sure. Yes, sir. I do not know why\nanyone would ever----\nSenator Hawley. You are pretty sure or you are 100 percent\nsure?\nMr. Shepard. I am 100 percent sure I----\nSenator Hawley. And you are--you are----\nMr. Shepard [continuing]. Would not do that.\nSenator Hawley. Okay. You are on the record and you are\nunder oath.\nMr. Shepard. Understood. Yes, sir.\nSenator Hawley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Rubio. I guess, I know it has been a tough\nhearing. You can hear some of the pushback and I would just\ncomment, you know, we read through some of this and you sort of\nsee some of the language--we see the performance, and we see\nsort of in your testimony and this discussion about providing\nsort of private equity-type structures and metrics to the\nprogram moving forward as a way to justify sort of why the\nprogram is not delivering the same numbers as it did in the\npast or historically has done, and sort of couched in the sense\nthat we want accountability for taxpayer dollars.\nBut I think one of the reasons why this program exists is\nthe acknowledgment or the belief by members of Congress that\nprivate equity--I think this problem has gotten worse--\nfundamentally undervalues innovation. And so you see these buzz\nwords like private equity to justify the reduced activity and I\nget concerned, I personally do, you know.\nAnd I think one of the trends we have seen is the\nfinalization of our companies, particularly the management of\ncompanies, has come into being. You have seen less investment\nin things that have a longer life, for example physical assets\nlike equipment or machines or plants or even research and\ndevelopment. Industrial innovation has paid a price, in my view\nanyways, as we financialize corporate governance and corporate\ndecisionmaking. At some point, the financial markets concluded\nthat it was just too risky to invest in these sorts of things\nanymore.\nAnd so it would be ironic if the very program that was\ndesigned to help small business overcome financialization of\nthese decisions was financialized itself.\nAnd so when we add what we have heard from you today, these\nnew metrics that are being designed, with the numbers that we\nhave seen and some of the other things that have been brought\nup, I think you understand that this Committee is pretty--for\nlack of a scientific term--fired up about not just the\ndirection this program is going but our view as to the\ndirection it is being taken.\nAnd I hope that came across today. It certainly did for me.\nMr. Shepard. Yes, sir.\nChairman Rubio. I do not know if the ranking member has\nanything to add.\nSenator Cardin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nMr. Shepard, I think there is a general consensus here on a\ncouple of things. First, we like the SBIC program. Democrats,\nRepublicans, small businesses, we like the SBIC program.\nSecondly, we are not satisfied with the time it takes for\nan application to be received and the numbers that are being\napproved and the outreach to underserved communities not having\ninvestors.\nI would point out, you indicated that the program has\ngrown. Our information shows that actually there was a\nreduction in the total funds in the SBIC from fiscal year 2017\nto fiscal year 2018. It actually went down.\nSo that is unacceptable. When you look at the total volume\ntoday, it is about what it was four years ago. So it is not the\ntype of growth that we would have expected in the SBIC program.\nSo this is a hearing on reauthorization. There is something\nnot working. If it is the law, let us know how we need to\nchange the law so Congress can give you the tools you need\nthrough statute. If it is the way that your agency is organized\nand the resources that you are getting, let us know that so\nthat we can deal with it. If it is a matter of capacity in your\nagency, we need to know that also. That is our responsibility\non oversight.\nBut the bottom line is this is a very important program. It\nis not meeting the expectations that we have set for it in\ntotal availability and it is not fairly distributed among all\nof the communities that need small business financing.\nSo this is an opportunity for you to present to us ways\nthat we can improve the law and give you the tools you need\nbecause you have bipartisan support for this program. So I\nwould just urge you to take advantage of that and get that\ninformation to this committee.\nMr. Shepard. We will do so and appreciate that, Senator.\nThank you.\nChairman Rubio. Senator Hawley, anything else?\nSenator Hawley. No.\nChairman Rubio. Thank you. Thanks for being here today. We\nare going to transition to the second panel. Again, our\napologies for the late start.\nI will introduce the second panel as they come up. It will\nbuy us some time here.\nBrett Palmer is the President of the Small Business\nInvestor Alliance.

Mr. Palmer,\nthank you, and the floor is yours.\nSTATEMENT OF BRETT PALMER, PRESIDENT, SMALL BUSINESS INVESTOR\nALLIANCE, WASHINGTON, DC\nMr. Palmer. Thank you, Chairman Rubio.\nMy name is Brett Palmer. I am President of the Small\nBusiness Investor Alliance.\nI would like to thank the Chairman, the Ranking Member, and\nthe other Senators participating today for taking part in this\nhearing, for reviewing the Small Business Investment Company\nprogram, discussing small business investment generally, and\nanswering any questions you may have about it.\nThe SBIA is the trade association of small business\ninvestors that includes the SBIC industry. The goal of the SBIA\nis to promote a healthy ecosystem for small business investing,\none that benefits both small businesses and their investors,\nand thereby promoting economic growth and job creation.\nSmall business investment companies have been around since\n1958. And what was true in the 1950s will always be true. Small\nbusinesses need external capital to grow and to thrive and to\nreach the next level. And it is really hard to access that type\nof capital.\nDebenture and non-levered SBICs have increased the amount\nof small business investment capital, with over $28 billion\ninvested domestically over the last five years. All SBIC\ninvestments must be used exclusively for domestic small\nbusinesses with at least 25 of those investments going to\nsmaller enterprises, which is a smaller standard than the small\nbusiness standard.\nSBICs cannot be used for an investment for short-term\nprojects and cannot be used for moving jobs offshore. By law,\nSBICs are focused on America.\nSBICs provide an important national benefit because SBICs\nare often the first institutional capital into small\nbusinesses. SBICs help with not only capital but also expert\nadvice on how to scale up and professionalize as a company\ngrows.\nSBICs invest across a broad range of industries and across\na broad range of geographies. It is common to see investment in\nmanufacturing and other not so flashy industries and in low and\nmoderate income areas, as well as parts of the country\ngenerally overlooked or flown over.\nIn contrast, venture investment is extremely concentrated\nand a lot of private equity investment is also concentrated.\nSBICs invest in a far, far more broader footprint. This is one\nof the reasons why we need more SBICs and we need them in more\nplaces.\nThe SBIC program has a very strong taxpayer protection\nsystem built into the system. It is maintained at zero subsidy\nnow, the SBIC debenture program, for about 22 years since\nCongress reformed in the late 1990s.\nThe SBIC program continues to have some of the healthiest\nand strongest payback period in its 60-year history. The annual\ncharge that Chairman Rubio mentioned is a fee that covers\npotential losses to the program. It is at its lowest rate in 60\nyears. The SBIC leverage has continued to operate that zero\nsubsidy and we expect that to continue.\nThere is a strong private sector interest in investing in\nsmall businesses, and particularly via Small Business\nInvestment Companies, which is critical because the private\nsector is the leading component to make the program work. This\nis not a subsidy program. It is not a grant program. It is not\na prop up failing businesses program. It is a market driven\nprogram where market forces are aligned with a clear public\nbenefit of more jobs, more innovation, and more geographic\ndispersion of opportunity.\nA 2017 Library of Congress study, which you all have\nmentioned, highlighted that the SBIC program has backed\nbusinesses that created 3 million jobs and support an\nadditional 6.5 million jobs over the 20 year period, an\nincredibly efficient rate to the taxpayer. This study was\nperformed by researchers from Duke and Pepperdine's Business\nSchool.\nYour average debenture-backed SBIC business added 125 new\njobs. Non-levered and equity oriented SBICs created over 530\nnew jobs per small business. That is an average, that is not\nuniversal for each one. But to put that into perspective, over\nthe 20-year period of the study, that represents about 7\npercent of the net new jobs in the United States from SBIC-\nbacked businesses. That is an extraordinary number for a little\nknown program, but that is what it is supposed to do.\nMost of these companies will never even consider going\npublic. They will never be written about in the Wall Street\nJournal. But they almost all grow, changing lives and\nsupporting communities.\nAll of these quiet little business successes add up to\nsomething big, which is the reason the SBIC program has broad\nbipartisan support. The SBIC program is good, but it is not\nperfect and there are limits to any government program. Every\ngovernment program can benefit from congressional oversight,\nregular reforms and updates, and we thank you for having this\nhearing.\nWe welcome the oversight and we want to work with Congress\nto make improvements. There are still significant market gaps\nthat are leaving too many small businesses unable to grow due\nto a lack of capital.\nMy written testimony, which is far more robust than you see\nfrom normal congressional testimony--it is almost a phone book\nthat you see before you--is broken into three categories\nbecause it is an unusual program. It is a plain English of how\nthe program works, is the first section.\nThe second section is ideas for improving the operation of\nthe program and for using the program to shrink what is\ncommonly called the ``valley of death'' because there are still\na lot of businesses that are good businesses that are not able\nto access the capital they need to access that next level.\nAnd third, and regrettably, is a sampling of the profoundly\nfrustrating dumbfounding mismanagement that is creating\nunnecessary risks and cutting off of capital to small\nbusinesses.\nI would like to thank Senator Rubio, Coons and others here\nfor their efforts to be thoughtful and deliberate about\nmanufacturing in particular, and we would like to see an\ninternational policy as we compete globally against the Chinese\nand others to really create that long-term investing.\nI would be happy to answer any of your questions.\nI would also mention, with the few seconds I have left,\nthat I would like, if the chance presents itself, to respond to\nsome of the questions directed to the first witness that I\nthink, frankly, need significantly more fleshing out to give a\nfull picture of the truth.\nBut with that, I would hand it over to Mr. Muro.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Palmer follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nChairman Rubio. Mr. Muro.\nSTATEMENT OF MARK MURO, SENIOR FELLOW AND POLICY DIRECTOR,\nMETROPOLITAN POLICY PROGRAM, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION, WASHINGTON,\nDC\nMr. Muro. Thank you, Chairman Rubio, Ranking Member Cardin,\nmembers of the Committee who I assume will see this material\notherwise. Thank you for inviting me today.\nMy expertise revolves around what my group at Brookings\nInstitution calls America's advanced industry sector. More on\nthat in just a sec.\nBut I want to suggest how the SBIC could be better\npositioned to support those industries that our particular\nindustry claims we need to talk about. Specifically, I want to\nurge that the committee explicitly prioritize advanced\nmanufacturing enterprises when it revisits the SBIC's\nactivities in the coming months.\nNot all industries matter equally. Indeed, these high-\nproductivity, high-pay innovation industries anchor American\ncompetitiveness, and matter inordinately. We need to think\nabout them and nudge the SBA's and the SBIC's services and\nresources toward support of those.\nWhat are advanced industries? Why do they matter? Brookings\ndefines these industries as those in which the R&D spending per\nworker reaches the top 20 percent of all industries and the\nshare of workers with significant STEM knowledge exceeds the\nnational average.\nWe count three energy, 12 service industries, and 35\nmanufacturing industries. This super sector is dominated by\nstrong advanced manufacturing. Among these 35 manufacturing\nindustries is automaking, aerospace, pharma, medical devices,\ncomputers, semiconductors, chemicals and their huge supply\nchains.\nWhy do they matter so much? The advance industries sector\nencompasses much of the nation's most crucial economic\nactivity. It anchors the traded sector, generates above average\nproductivity, and supports long supply chains. It spreads\ninnovation because its inordinate R&D spending drives product\nand process innovation, both within enterprises and then\nthrough spillovers throughout the economy.\nAnd then this group of industries I am talking about train\nand employ the nation's STEM workforce. They find them, they\nlocate them, they hire them, they train them both engineering\ntalent but also non-BA technical workers, what we call blue\ncollar STEM.\nWe can go over a few of the statistics here. They are\ndelivering value, these industries. Advanced industries perform\n90 percent of the private sector R&D in our country.\nAdvanced industries, including advanced manufacturing, are\nextraordinarily productive. Each worker generated approximately\n$250,000 worth of output last year, twice the amount of the\nother sectors.\nAnd advanced industries punch way above their weight in\ngenerating our GDP, $3.7 trillion worth of output, 18 percent\nsignificant. Advanced manufacturing, about 40 percent of that.\nThe bottom line is this, without a competitive advanced\nsector, it is going to be simply not possible for the U.S. to\nmaintain global preeminence, sustained prosperity, and renew\nnational unity. So I want to bring that national imperative\ninto this discussion.\nBut here is the problem, as we have been hearing, there is\nnow abundant evidence that the primacy of America's advanced\nindustries, and especially its advanced manufacturing sectors\nbeing contested and eroding. Slipping U.S. R&D investments, low\nSTEM graduating production, thinning of manufacturing\necosystems is our problem.\nSo we are going to need to intervene here. But the\nchallenge of finance is a very real additional challenge.\nInherent biases of VC and capital resources skew the existing\nsmall firm financing system away from these capital intensive\nmanufacturing enterprises.\nThere is a role to intervene here. Policy should address\nthis.\nThe SBIC is clearly a useful tool for some of this work and\nshould be further enabled to assist advanced manufacturing\nconcerns in the coming years.\nThe lack of sectoral specificity in the program and in loan\nmaking means that public funds are not always maybe channeled\nto the highest and best use in this national purpose.\nAnd then we have heard about the repayment structure which\nbegins immediately and is comprised of an SBA annual charge\nplus interest due, just simply is not conducive to the nature\nof the long-term product development timelines that advanced\nmanufacturing firms require.\nSo I endorse several of the ideas that I think are being\ndiscussed. Explicit prioritization of advanced manufacturing\ngrowth makes a ton of sense and the Committee could provide for\nmore robust and patient capital in SBIC funding.\nThe SBA should adopt an ethos of investing in the national\ninterest here. It is not just a technical matter. The national\ninterest needs to enter this discussion and I think this\nCommittee has been strong on that.\nAmerica's medium- and long-term competitiveness will be\nheavily influenced by its success in expanding these advanced\nindustries. Success or failure will be determined, meanwhile,\nby our choices--something I think you have written about--and\nwhat we choose to do and not to do in a world of great\ncompetition.\nSo I think working to improve the availability of patient\ncapital for smaller advanced manufacturing firms would be a\ngood choice.\nSo thank you again for having me.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Muro follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nChairman Rubio. Dr. Pan.\nSTATEMENT OF BANU OZKAZANC-PAN, PhD., ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF\nMANAGEMENT, UMASS BOSTON AND VISITING ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF\nSOCIOLOGY, BROWN UNIVERSITY, BOSTON, MA\nMs. Ozkazanc-Pan. Thank you.\nChairman Rubio, Ranking Member Cardin, and Members of the\nCommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify here today.\nIn addition to my very long title, I am the founding\ndirector of the Venture Capital Inclusion Lab at Brown\nUniversity and happy to speak further about some of the work\nthat we are doing.\nToday, I will provide a broad overview of the VC industry\nand then go on to discuss the specifics as they relate to women\nand minorities.\nThe VC industry last year saw record growth in investments.\nLast year, the industry invested around $130.9 billion across\n8,948 deals and raised $55.5 billion across 256 funds,\nrepresenting record amounts compared to the dot com boom era.\nDuring this time, around 62 percent of total invested\ncapital was due to deals sized $50 million or larger. VC mega-\nfunds, or those raising $500 million or more, accounted for 57\npercent of all capital raised. These large funds were partially\nsupported by the involvement of private equity and corporate VC\ninvestments.\nDuring this time, we saw that both deal size and valuations\ngrow, particularly in early stages. Right now, $25 million\ndeals or larger now represent almost 62 percent of all early\nstage deals by value. However, whether the pace of such\ninvestment activity is sustainable continues and needs to be\nseen.\nThere is some concern about the amount of available capital\nand whether it is being deployed efficiently. In addition, the\nmajority of VC investments go to pharma, biotech, and software\nindustries with software representing the largest single sector\nfor VC money.\nDespite the growth of VC investments, the situation for\nwomen and minorities is quite different. On the investor side,\na 2017 report by TechCrunch found that women represented 8\npercent of all partners in top 100 VC firms. Only 1 percent of\nsurvey's 713 VC firms had Black decisionmakers, coming out with\na whopping 7 individuals, while Hispanic decisionmakers were\nrepresented at 1.5 percent and Asians at 24 percent. Overall,\n85 percent of decisionmakers in the U.S. VC industry are male\nand 73 percent are white.\nOn the entrepreneur side, less than 1 percent of Black\nwomen receive VC funding and startups with a female CEO have\nreceived only 2.7 percent of all VC money.\nWe see that all male teams represent 82 percent of all VC-\nbacked startups. Blacks represent 1 percent, Latinos around 2\npercent, and Asians around 18 percent. In general, Whites\nrepresent about 77 percent of all VC-backed companies.\nDespite these challenging facts, 40 percent of all current\nbusinesses in the U.S. are women-owned. These businesses have\nbeen growing at impressive rates. Between 2007 and 2018, women-\nowned businesses grew at 58 percent compared to 12 percent\ngrowth across all businesses. Women of color-owned businesses\ngrew an impressive 163 percent during the same time.\nDespite this growth, revenues generated by women of color-\nowned businesses have dropped between 2007 and 2018 by 21\npercent, whereas non-minority-owned business revenue grew by\n17. Research shows that if revenues generated by minority\nwomen-owned businesses matched those currently generated by all\nwomen-owned businesses, they would add 4 million additional\njobs and $1.4 trillion in revenues to the U.S. economy.\nSimilarly, if minority-owned businesses were at\nentrepreneurial parity, the U.S. would gain 1.9 million firms,\n13.2 million more employees, and an additional $2.9 trillion in\ngross receipts.\nThe challenges are taking place at a historic moment. The\nU.S. is changing in terms of demography and this will mean new\nconsumers, markets, and opportunities will emerge. At the same\ntime, increased global competition requires investments to make\nthe U.S. economy strong and competitive.\nSBICs can provide these investments and can be even\nstronger in terms of employment and job creation.\nNew programs, such as on-ramps for women and minority fund\nmanagers and investors can boost the already better than\nindustry numbers for gender and racial diversity in SBICs. They\ncan allow expanded deal flow options and networks and move away\nfrom some of the group think and pattern matching that allowed\nthe VC industries to fund companies like Theranos. They can\ntake advantage of new customer segments and consumer needs that\ncan be served through diverse firms.\nBy investing in industries beyond those associated with\ntraditional VC funding, we can build a sufficiently diversified\neconomy. And by continuing to fill the gaps in capital\nresulting from mega-deals in the VC community, we can expand\nopportunity across geography, gender, and race.\nThank you.\n[The prepared statement of Ms. Ozkazanc-Pan follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nChairman Rubio. Thank you.\nLet me start here. Mr. Palmer, you have been the president\nof the association that represents the SBIC companies for many\nyears now, right?\nMr. Palmer. Eleven years, yes.\nChairman Rubio. So before this hearing, we tried to get\nfund managers to come testify. We could not get a single person\nto come and tell us about their experience. Why will not--\nSenator Hawley touched on it pretty extensively. Why are they\nnot here today? Why will they not come?\nMr. Palmer. Well, there are some that had legitimate\nbusiness conflicts, but there is legitimate fear. The Associate\nAdministrator is well known to the industry. His style is one\nthat certainly leaves significant open questions. The fund\nmanagers believe they have a fiduciary duty to their investors\nand they are afraid of retaliation where there are so many\nsteps in the process that are judgment calls that if they go\nagainst you, you have got a big problem. And they feel that\nthey cannot, in good faith to their investors, speak publicly\nlest they put their investors at risk.\nChairman Rubio. The bottom line is that there are members\nof your organization, these investment companies, who feel that\nif they come testify before the elected representatives of the\nU.S. Senate about the status of the program and how it is\nworking, that they are going to get hurt, that there will be\ndecisions made on the margins that is going to harm them and\nultimately put in danger their obligation to their investors.\nThey are afraid to come----\nMr. Palmer. Yes.\nChairman Rubio [continuing]. Because they are afraid they\nare going to be retaliated against.\nMr. Palmer. Yes, and though it is difficult to quantify\nthose judgment decisions, there have been events that have\nhappened in the past that they look at, and on the face of it,\nsay that to me looks like retaliation for not hiring him or\nspeaking out against him previously and we just do not feel\nthat we have--they will do it privately. And it is a challenge\nbecause there is--being in the sunshine is important. But they\nhave an obligation and they are legitimately scared. I tried to\ntalk to them.\nChairman Rubio. And I raise this without him being here and\nable to respond because he was asked the question directly\nearlier.\nMr. Palmer. Right.\nChairman Rubio. So we have now on the record his response\nto that question and we have your statement here, so that\nSenator Hawley's comments do not just stand on their own but we\nnow have a representative of the association.\nDr. Pan, there is, as you know, the requirement--the SBA\nessentially requires that an SBIC applicant have two fund\nmanagers. They have to both have previous experience and\nexpertise with the program.\nI have drafted a proposal that would allow applicants to\nhave a single fund manager with the experience and provide SBA\ntraining to applicants whose management team has no previous\nexperience with the program.\nMy question is do you believe this provision could help\nexpand the pool of potential fund managers? And would this kind\nof proposal help to increase diversity in the venture capital\nand private equity communities?\nMs. Ozkazanc-Pan. Thank you for your question, Mr. Rubio.\nI do believe these are good first steps to ensure that\nthere is opportunities available for women and minority fund\nmanagers, and sometimes experience and exposure could be one\nway in which they feel left out. So I think a program like\nthis, with additional elements, could be very beneficial to\ndiversifying SBIC fund managers.\nMr. Palmer. I can give you a case of that that is exactly\ntrue. The past chairwoman of my board, Carolyn Galiette with\nIronwood Capital, she will tell you point blank that she would\nnever have gotten licensed today--even though she is on her\nthird or fourth license--if they had the standards now in place\nfor licensure that she had back then. And her fund invests, by\ndesign, more than half of her investments are in women,\nminorities and low-income areas as a top tier firm.\nChairman Rubio. Mr. Muro, I wanted to sort of lead into the\nquestion with the following statement. There is two orthodoxies\nthat have been in place for some time which frankly, I have\ndealt with and confronted and, in some cases, at some point\npotentially even supported in some of the decisions.\nThe two orthodoxies are these: the first is that there is a\nvery limited role for government to play writ large across\neverything. And I am a person who believes in limited\ngovernment. But that the bottom line is the private market will\ndetermine what is a good idea or not a good idea, particularly\nin the role of investment.\nAnd the second orthodoxy is that we are headed into an era\nthat is good for us, in which we would innovate here but then\nmake things somewhere else. And then we would be on the high\nend and let someone else make it. We will innovate the\nsoftware, we will innovate the ideas, and then someone else\nwill build it and that is better for the U.S. consumer.\nThese are the two orthodoxies.\nThe problem with the first one, that first one, is that\ninvestment today, it is my view but I think it is supported and\nthe report we put out earlier this highlights this, the\nfinancialization of so much of our corporate and business\nactivity in this country has driven investment decisions toward\nhow can I get the highest return for the lowest risk in the\nshortest amount of time? That is what is being rewarded and\nthat is what is driving investment decisions.\nSo that is the first problem with simply saying the private\nmarket will take care of it, is that when you do that, when\nyour focus is on how can I get the highest return in the\nshortest amount of time with the lowest amount of risk, you are\nnot going to invest in research and development. You are not\ngoing to invest in innovation. It may be the greatest idea in\nhistory or it may be a total flop.\nAnd that is problematic because of the second point. And\nthat is this notion that we are going to invent things here but\nthey are going to be made somewhere else will not last forever.\nSo there is a lot of noise out there about Huawei. What people\nare missing about Huawei and telecommunications is an important\npiece but it is just one piece of a much broader strategy in\nwhich China, as an example, has used the government support of\nits national champion companies to establish dominance in a\nseries of critical fields to the 21st century.\nSo how it works is you are one of these companies. You have\ngovernment-backed credit. You have a guaranteed protection in\nthe domestic marketplace. So here is a billion people that only\nyou can sell to. Plus, we are going to give you money.\nSo what do these companies do? They can now go abroad in\nrail cars. They can flood the market with batteries or\nrobotics. And no one can compete with them until none of their\ncompetitors exist and they have created a dominance in that\nindustry.\nAnd so I wanted you to address--the first point, I think,\nis well established and you can talk about it. But it is the\nsecond one that I want people to understand, that what is\nflowing away from us in the 21st century will eventually be the\ninnovation, as well. But there is a value, an inherent value,\nin the jobs that are created as a national priority in those\nindustries that we are going to have to have a response to.\nWe are going to have to have a collective national\nresponse--that does not have to be partisan, by the way--on\nChina's industrial policy. Because we are not competing with\nbusinesses like ours. We are competing with national champions\nbacked by the government of the soon to be largest economy, not\nper capita but gross largest economy in the world with\nextraordinary market resources that are going to, in essence,\nleave us in a world where their companies will dominate all of\nthese fields at the same time as the financialization of our\ncorporate and investment decisions is leading us further and\nfurther away from the kinds of things we need to do to compete\nagainst them.\nSo I told you it was a long question.\nMr. Muro. Yes, I think you are pointing to some of the most\ncritical issue we are facing. We know there are market failures\non market irregularities and how resources flow at home. What\nhas happened, I think, is that we are realizing that by\nallowing, by failing to support some of these sectors, they are\nflowing offshore on their production end and it is no longer\nsimply a choice between innovation and production.\nMore and more, we are learning that innovation requires\nspecific inputs and detailed iterative knowhow. And even the\naccumulation of knowledge in specific regions that become\nwarehouses of knowledge. So we have to manage and protect those\nbecause you can lose--there are many examples, solar PV cells,\nelectric motors, rare earth elements, LEDs, many others, where\nwe thought we were just off-shoring the production and pretty\nsoon it turned out that we were losing control and leadership\nin the creativity.\nAnd it is because innovation is not a high-flown purely\nintellectual activity. It is about small, embedded iterative\nproduct iterations and process improvements. We have to be able\nto manufacture so that we can innovate.\nAnd I think that logic has gotten somewhat skewed. I think\nthe innovation has gotten associated simply with digital\ninnovation and we have lost track of how things actually are\ncreated in plants.\nChairman Rubio. And I will turn it over to the Ranking\nMember, other than to say that even in the digital space that\nis true. So the platform known as the internet and all of the\ntransactions that take place in it has spawned a bunch of\ninnovation. One of them is mobile payment, right? Today, China\nhas--you could argue that we innovated the platform upon which\nit is occurring. But the innovation and the application of it,\nwhen it comes to mobile payment, they lead the world both in\nadopting it but also in all of the technologies that are\nrelated to it.\nSo at some point in the future, when all of these other\ncompanies around the world want to go on a mobile payment\nsystem because that is what everyone is doing, they will\ncontrol--even in the digital space--that industry and the\ntechnologies that drive it. The 5G is another example.\nThe Ranking Member.\nSenator Cardin. Let me thank all of our witnesses.\nThis has been certainly an interesting hearing, a little\nbit livelier than most of our hearings. But the focus is on the\nreauthorization of Congress of the SBIC programs. As I said in\nthe beginning, this is our seventh hearing on reauthorization\nof parts of the SBA.\nSo I just really would like to get your views, I hope we\ncould get some short answers. But the SBIC program, you all\nbelieve is an important tool available for small businesses?\nMr. Palmer. Yes.\nSenator Cardin. And it appears, from the way that you have\npresented your testimony in response to the Chairman's\nquestion, that it is not doing everything it should be doing\ntoday. Is that a fair enough statement?\nMr. Palmer. Not as much as it could be doing. I mean,\npeople are trying. It is just a question of there are barriers\nto being as successful as it could be.\nSenator Cardin. Are those barriers statutory or is it the\nway it is being administered?\nMr. Palmer. There are several. There is clearly a\nmismanagement problem and a hostility in the functioning of the\nprogram. I do not say that lightly and I do not say that\nwithout evidence. I have got a book in front of me where you\ncan document that.\nBut I think there is also, for the risk aversion of the\nprogram, as far as the ability to make sure that it has zero\nsubsidy, also really minimizes risk. And so as you minimize\nrisk, it takes it away from some of the earlier stage side. And\nI think it is time to really look more aggressively, what can\nwe be doing to make that valley of death smaller, to allow for\nmore equity, more patient capital, more manufacturing, some\nearlier stage businesses that are not quite as good.\nThere are a number of things we need to be looking at to\nfigure out some new tools to make sure we can do that.\nSenator Cardin. So was the early stage capital sabotaged to\nnot work? Because it seems to me early stage capital would deal\nwith some of the issues that we have all been talking about,\nand it was started and stopped.\nMr. Palmer. Well, there is several different versions of\nearly stage that they have done. There was an Early Stage\nprogram that was done around 2012 or thereabouts that actually\nworked. They only licensed five funds.\nThe biggest problem they had with it is that you could only\nget licensed once a year. So you were in, and if they had a\nquestion you were out. And so you had to go back and forth a\nlittle bit. You have to wait another year. And private sector\nwill not wait a year to raise a fund.\nSo that could be popped up tomorrow with the regulations\nreactivated and all they have to do is go to a rolling\nlicensure. That would work and that operates at zero taxpayer\nsubsidy.\nThe participating securities program was a program that ran\nfrom 1994 to 2004, that was extraordinarily good at creating\nearly stage capital investment, it was $21 billion. But it also\nlost about $1 billion or $1.5 billion because of the cockamamie\npayback structure.\nThe SBA has internal models of what they could have done to\nfix that and that really could have been fixed and reformed\nwith some very modest changes. That could work again, but you\nwould have to make those changes because if you do not protect\nthe taxpayer you have a problem.\nBut that was why that changed.\nSenator Cardin. And it could have been changed----\nMr. Palmer. It absolutely could have.\nSenator Cardin [continuing]. By the SBA?\nMr. Palmer. That could have been changed--this is going\nback to the mid-2000s, before my time so I was there post. But\nI believe some of that could have been done by the\nadministration, which I was in, full disclosure. But some of it\nwould have required some congressional changes, if I recall.\nSenator Cardin. So it appears like, what I have heard from\ntoday's hearing, it is not so much the fundamental law that has\nbeen passed by Congress, but the way the law is being\nimplemented?\nMr. Palmer. Yes.\nSenator Cardin. It is not reaching its full potential. It\nis working but it is not working as well as it could work.\nMr. Palmer. Right. And I think one of the things--you heard\na lot about risk from the first witness. What you never heard\nwas reward. Reward is a critical element to risk. We have to\ntake risk. We are trying to facilitate risk. We are trying to\nfacilitate the private sector to take risks that they might not\notherwise have taken that are not irrational risks but that are\nproperly incentivized without subsidy.\nAnd we have to be not paralyzed by risk but actually figure\nout how to do that.\nSenator Cardin. No question, small businesses always\npresent a risk. We know that.\nMr. Palmer. Right.\nSenator Cardin. So we recognize if you do not take risks,\nyou are not going to make progress.\nThe Chairman mentioned, I thought, a very good point on\nminority participation--professor, I want to get you engaged in\nthis--about the fund managers and the experience of the fund\nmanagers, and that can be used to as a way to prevent outreach\nin underserved communities if you set up such high standards\nthat communities do not have representation in the funds\nthemselves, in the investors themselves.\nAre there other recommendations that you would make so that\nwe can get more participation from women, from minorities in\nunderserved communities?\nMs. Ozkazanc-Pan. Absolutely. And I would be happy to work\nwith respective staffs for solutions, given some of my research\nand some of the findings around best practices.\nOne of the things we have seen work are fellowships or\napprenticeships that are funded. Sometimes they are matched,\nsometimes they are fully funded. But this allows women and\nminorities who may not have the financial background to enter\ninto the fund manager position, to gain that experience and\nexposure.\nThere is a venture fellows program at a new venture capital\nfirm that has placed their first fellow into another VC firm.\nSo there are examples across the board of firms doing things\nright.\nAnd lastly, just as a followup, at the VC Inclusion Lab, we\nare actually following up with each of the 40-plus firms that\nsigned the National Venture Capital Association diversity\npledge in 2014, to see what they have done and what changes\nthey have seen. So I would be able to give you more concrete\ninformation hopefully in a few months when we have contacted\nand gotten information from each of those firms.\nSenator Cardin. As I encouraged from the last witness,\nplease give us your suggestions because you see there is a lot\nof frustration here and we really do want this program to be at\nits full--meet its full potential. And it is not doing that\ntoday.\nSo one of the areas is what you are talking about on\nparticipation from groups that we just do not have the numbers.\nThese numbers are pathetic. They are not even in the ballpark\nof where they need to be.\nSo we have taken looks at other areas of SBA programs that\nhave not reached, we think, full potential and we have taken\nsteps to correct that.\nSo your recommendations there, I think, can help us in\ntrying to meet those goals.\nMr. Palmer. And one thing I would add to that is, you know,\nit is a particular risk to step out and try to raise a private\nequity fund. You have no salary, you take a year to two years.\nAnd it is a particularly risk for women and minorities to take\nthat risk. It is a bigger leap.\nAnd so if you are trying to get more diverse fund managers\nin the SBIC program--which we certainly want to do, and I\nactually have some ideas in my testimony that I do think help\nmove the needle there--just look at the new funds. You heard\nfrom the first witness that we have so many new funds coming\nin. Total new pipeline is down 45 percent year over year. It is\nnot new funds coming in. They are being actively scared off.\nAnd if you cannot keep the funds that you have because they\nthink they are being mistreated and paralyzed, then how are you\nsupposed to get people to take that entrepreneurial risk to\nform a new fund that is a woman or a minority? It is really\nhard.\nSenator Cardin. It is just hard to understand why we have\nnot done better in creating new funds in minority and women\ncommunities. It is a logical step for the SBIC program to have\nachieved and it does require an attitude of SBA to do this.\nMr. Palmer. I have had 10 chairs of the board over my\nterms. Four have been women. So that is not 50 percent, but\nthat is good. We actually have a lot of women in leadership.\nActually, our northeast president next year is going to be a\nwoman from your state.\nWe have a lot--we have tried a lot of women and we are\nmaking progress there. It does take time. And I do think, part\nof the problem to get an SBIC fund is you have to come from\nprivate equity. So you are recycling from the same pool. We are\nfar more diverse than the rest of the private equity and\nventure industry but you are not going to really have a\nbreakout until you can broaden that pool out a little bit.\nAnd so actually, I have some proposals in here about how to\ndo that that I think work and could happen very quickly, that\nwe could see the next generation of minority and women fund\nmanagers in a way that is constructive and without subsidy.\nSo there is a lot we can do there but the program really is\nbeing--has major management problems right now. They do not\nhave staff in senior positions. You are missing more than one\nsenior staffer. You are missing the top career staffer, the\nDeputy Associate Administrator. You are missing the Director of\nLicensing and Program Development. They have three what are\ncalled area chiefs, that are in charge of managing the teams\nthat manage the funds day-to-day. There are three of those. Two\nof them are vacant.\nYou have a lot of--and some of these are positions that\nhave been open for over two years. And the Program Development\nOffice, whose job it is to recruit new funds and to help\nlicense funds in underserved states and underserved\ncommunities, consistent with Senator Rubio's bill, has gone\nfrom four FTEs to one. There is only a director left with zero\nemployees, and I do not think he has got a budget since last\nDecember.\nSo I am not sure the private sector is seeing the program\nbeing managed in the same way that the person running the\nprogram is seeing it. We see it from a very different lens that\nis very concerning. And I think the numbers and data back this\nup.\nThe private sector is not saying okay, we do not want to do\nSBICs or small business investment because there is an\nopportunity. But we are looking at that and going oh my gosh,\nare you kidding me? Am I going to walk into that buzz saw? Am I\ngoing to put my investors and my professional career on that\nline? And that is a problem.\nSenator Cardin. Look, I think Senator Kennedy's point about\nwe look at action rather than words, it was disappointing that\nwe did not have an acknowledgment as to numbers being\nunacceptable.\nI thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Rubio. Before turning to Senator Duckworth, just\none observation on your point. It is hard to attract new people\nwhen one of the requirements is that you cannot be new.\nMr. Palmer. Mm-hmm.\nChairman Rubio. In essence, what we are saying, you have to\nhave two fund managers with previous experience in order to be\nan applicant, you are basically saying the only people that can\napply are the people that have done it before. Well that, by\ndefinition, knocks out everybody who is new and wants to come\nin.\nMr. Palmer. That is right. You have to basically have been\nrecruited somewhere else in the private equity industry and\nthen you can spin out to form an SBIC. And that is why one of\nmy proposals is you can form bank-owned non-levered SBIC funds.\nThat is a big mouthful. But banks can do that and they have\ndone that. They exist across the country.\nAnd banks have something that SBICs do not have, which is\nscale. Some SBICs are as few as two people. Banks have really\ngood recruiting programs. They have gotten good at that in the\npast couple of years. And so if they form bank-owned non-\nlevered--one, they can help fill the equity gap, that is long-\nterm patient capital. Two, they can broaden the footprint. And\nthree, they can seed the next generation of private equity fund\nmanagers. That would be helpful.\nThat is not the only solution. This has got to be a multi-\nstep process. But there are a number of things that we can do.\nChairman Rubio. That may be a great idea, but it is not\ngoing to work unless you find a shorter term, a shorter word to\ndescribe it.\n[Laughter.]\nMr. Palmer. Yes, sorry, wonking out.\nChairman Rubio. We have got to come up with something\nfancy.\nSenator Duckworth.\nSenator Duckworth. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nActually, Mr. Palmer, I am glad you brought up banks\nbecause I think another component of the challenges that we are\nfacing with SBIC, especially for providing long-term loans to\ngrowing small businesses is that smaller banks find it very\ndifficult to invest in SBICs.\nMr. Palmer. Mm-hmm.\nSenator Duckworth. And when you talk about women and\nminority communities, you know, that is the realm of the\nsmaller banks, right?\nMr. Palmer. Mm-hmm.\nSenator Duckworth. They are the ones that tend to be, you\nknow, you have black-owned banks, women-owned banks. Those tend\nto be smaller. And I think that they are at a disadvantage to\nlarger banks who have greater access to this program.\nThis week Senator Young and I introduced the Investing in\nMain Street Act that would allow financial institutions to\ninvest a greater portion of their surplus and capital into\nSBICs.\nCould you describe how this legislation or this idea might\nhelp small businesses better access capital without\njeopardizing the safety and soundness of these financial\ninstitutions?\nMr. Palmer. Sure, absolutely. I think it is a great idea.\nThis is a provision that has already passed the House\nunanimously. It has broad bipartisan support and I appreciate\nyour taking it up.\nBasically, there is a timing issue, when banking law was\nwritten at a different time than the Small Business Investment\nAct. And so banks are allowed to invest more in small\nbusinesses via SBICs but the SBICs are not allowed to accept\nthe money from the banks to invest in small businesses from the\nbanks.\nIt is an accident of history. And this bill would fix that.\nAnd what that would do is get more capital flowing into SBICs.\nAnd one of the things that banks do, is banks have this big\nfootprint, to your point. And they have more interactions. And\na lot of times a small business will go to a bank and say I\nneed a loan. Well, that is not the type of stuff we do. You\nneed equity. You need unitranche. You need some complicated\nstructure, subordinated debt. You are not cash-flowing enough,\nwhatever it may be.\nBut they can turn around and hand that and say hey look,\nSBIC, here is a great opportunity. We know this client. They\nare in an underserved area. That is important to us from a\nbank, from a CRA perspective. Can you take a look and see if\nthis works. And often they do.\nThere are between 500 and 600 banks that are currently\ninvested in Small Business Investment Companies. They get very\ngood returns. But they also get community reinvestment\nassessment saying hey, is this serving these underserved\ncommunities? Because many times they are.\nSo yes, I think it would be very helpful. I think it does\nnot reduce any bank protections. It would still require the\napproval of the bank regulators to rise above that. But it\nwould increase small business access to capital and broaden the\nfootprint of small businesses that are exposed to it.\nSenator Duckworth. Thank you so much.\nProfessor Ozkazanc-Pan, you mentioned in your testimony\nwomen and minority-led VC firms have increased over time but a\nlot of work remains to be done. In 2016, SBA joined several\norganizations to launch the ONBOARD Initiative, designed to\ngive SBICs more options to hire diverse talent and assume board\nleadership positions.\nUnfortunately, it appears that SBA has done little to\npromote the initiative since its creation, I think missing a\nreal opportunity to help SBICs hire qualified, diverse\ncandidates for their management teams.\nCan you discuss why initiatives like this are so important\nto the investment community and what Congress and the SBA can\ndo to improve diversity on VC management firms?\nMs. Ozkazanc-Pan. Yes, absolutely. I think these kinds of\ninitiatives are profoundly important because they signal one,\ninterest and opportunity for women and minorities that they may\nnot otherwise see themselves in taking on these roles. But they\nalso communicate information and opportunities both in terms of\nsignaling to people that these are things available to them\nthat is not generally something that they see them for\nthemselves.\nI would say that if we continue with the program that is\nnot discontinued, that would be a step in the right direction.\nIn terms of VC firms, the reason we are seeing the\nemergence of women or minority or minority women-only focused\nfirms is because the VC, as a whole, is not moving fast enough.\nSo these are actually smaller firms that are trying to fill in\nthe gaps.\nAnd I believe that there could be potentially dedicated\nfunds that might also work in a similar fashion at the SBIC or\nthe SBA level.\nSenator Duckworth. Thank you.\nDid you want to add something, Mr. Muro?\nMr. Muro. My overarching point is simply that all of these\nare much more the technical questions. They really are about\noverall American well-being and competitiveness, you know. So\nto make sure that we are unveiling every great entrepreneurial\nopportunity, you know we are missing Einsteins and missing\nentrepreneurs.\nSo it is important that the systems works if we are going\nto push back against the challenge from China and elsewhere.\nSenator Duckworth. Thank you.\nMr. Palmer. And licensing more women fund managers and\nkeeping the fund managers you have that are women. There are a\nnumber of women that run funds right now that are pulling their\nhair out and deciding whether or not they want to do this. And\nso keeping them in, and getting more women fund managers, I\nthink is very helpful.\nThe Library of Congress studied this and they found\nbasically that like is more likely to invest in like. Women are\nmore likely to invest in other women and women-owned\nbusinesses. And the same thing is true for minority. When you\nhave minorities on your private equity team, you tend to invest\nmore in minority-run businesses.\nAnd so we just need to add more people into the program.\nSenator Duckworth. You spoke, Mr. Palmer, about these empty\npositions. The other thing that I am concerned about is the\nfact that there is no timeframe on application status updates\nand approvals or disapprovals as people are moving applications\nthrough the approval process.\nSenator Risch and I, along with several members of this\nCommittee, introduced the Small Business Investment Improvement\nAct of 2019 that would actually set the timeframes in which SBA\nmust give status updates to SBIC applicants and set deadlines.\nCan you speak a little bit about the importance of that\nportion of it, in terms of the need for timeframes and\ndeadlines?\nMr. Palmer. Sure. The way the SBICs work, they have to\nraise private capital. If you cannot pass a private filter, you\nhave no business going and getting a license. So you have to be\nresponsive to those private investors. You have to be able to\nmanage their expectations. I think I can get a license in X\nperiod of time. And this is a multi-step process with lots of\nstages.\nAnd every step of every licensing process, since the new\nmanagement of the Office of Investment has taken over, has\nbecome gummed up and unpredictable. It is regulatory roulette.\nAnd so we just do not know whether it is going to take--it\nused to take two weeks. Now it takes 13 months, in some cases,\nto get a green light letter for a repeat fund with a clean\nexaminations. That is nuts.\nMeanwhile, your investors, who are waiting on this money,\nthe pensions, the universities, the endowments who want to\ndeploy this capital to small business, they need to get a\nreturn. They cannot be sitting on millions of dollars doing\nnothing while you wait around for the SBA to get to license\nyou. Managing expectations is critical.\nSo having a process where it is clear, it is consistent, it\nis fair--if it is no, give me a quick no. But be fair about it.\nAnd dragging these things out where it is step after step after\nstep, it makes no sense.\nYou heard the first witness talk about examinations, he has\ndone such a good job. SBIC funds have zero control over the\nexaminations. The SBA does those. The SBA controls the time.\nThey control the results. It takes months to get them\nscheduled. It takes a month for them to do it. And it might\ntake 6 months or longer to get the results back.\nAnd during that time period, you cannot advance the\nlicensing period. You cannot reserve leverage. You cannot do a\nlot of your basic stuff you need to do unless your window\nhappens to come up at the same time their exam clock is going,\nof which you have no control.\nSo bragging about having a tightened credit standard for\nexaminations, where now 69 percent of the SBIC funds meet my\ncredit standard, they are compliant. Well, that means that the\nSBA is failing 30-plus percent of the SBICs being able to\noperate fully. And that does not work for licensing, it does\nnot work for any of it.\nAnd so having timelines and holding the accountable, I\nthink, is critical because this is the type of mundane stuff,\nadministrative stuff, that is paralyzing and is completely\nunnecessary.\nSenator Duckworth. Thank you.\nMr. Palmer. It is baffling. So it would be very helpful and\nwe welcome it. Thank you.\nSenator Duckworth. And it is a bipartisan bill.\nThank you. I yield back.\nChairman Rubio. Thank you.\nI want to thank you all for being here. We were delayed\nwith the votes and so forth, but just to kind of sum it up, if\nyou look at the need for innovation, innovation, by definition,\nis risky because it has never been done before. That is why it\nis innovative.\nAnd to do that takes money, right. And so people with money\nor entities with money are doing less of it than ever before.\nThe banks do not want to lend. They are kind of frozen in some\nway. They are just not in the business of doing that anymore.\nAnd private equity has moved further and further away from\nthat. They want to do less risky. They want a higher yield at a\nshorter or mid-term period of time and there is no taste for\nthat. So that is why programs like this exist in the small\nbusiness space.\nIn the big space, you are a multi-billionaire, you want to\ninvest in a rocket company, you can do that and they have done\nit. But if you are a small business person with a great idea,\nyou need access to capital. The banks will not give it to you.\nThe venture capital community does not like ideas like that. It\nis too risky. And so that is where this program comes into\nplay.\nSo it is concerning when we see the numbers flatline and\nbegin to decline at a time of great need. And I do not think we\nhave run out of ideas in this country, or people with them.\nAnd it is most concerning when you start to hear that we\nare going to be applying new criteria to the program and the\nbuzz words I am hearing are by the way, it is the same criteria\nof the funds and the banks that are not lending money now. So\nin essence, we are going to turn the SBIC program into a\nsimilar criteria to the ones that created the need for it in\nthe first place.\nAnd all of it happening, by the way, at a time which our\nNation desperately needs innovation. We need to come up with a\nresponse to Chinese industrial policy that threatens to\ndisplace us in industry after industry after industry around\nthe world. Very aggressive and we have not had an answer for\nit. And clearly, the current market conditions are not meeting\nthat demand.\nSo other than that, I think it is going well.\n[Laughter.]\nChairman Rubio. No, it was a very insightful hearing and\nthat is why I am so glad we are doing reauthorization because\nwe are not just having people come in and talk to us. We are\ngoing through the lines and the details at a granular level of\nthe entire agency and the programs that it has and trying to\nalign them to national priorities in a way that I hope can\nactually avoid some of the partisan fights that are going on.\nThis is stuff that should be unifying and I think can and\nhas a chance to be.\nSo we are grateful to all of you for your patience and the\ntime you have given us today.\nThe hearing record for this hearing is going to remain open\nfor two weeks. If there is any statements or questions for the\nrecord, they should be submitted by Wednesday, July 10th, at 5\np.m.\nAnd with that, the hearing is adjourned.\n[Whereupon, at 5:04 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]\nAPPENDIX MATERIAL SUBMITTED\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\n[all]",

Lisa\nMurkowski, Chairman of the Committee, presiding.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. LISA MURKOWSKI,\nU.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA\nThe Chairman. Good morning, everyone. The Committee will\ncome to order.\nWe are meeting to examine an issue that effectively we have\nbeen at a stalemate for quite some time--what we should do with\nthe used nuclear fuel that is accumulating at our nation's\nnuclear reactors.\nAs a starting point, I think we should recognize that\nnuclear energy is an important part of our country's electric\ngeneration mix. I believe it is a vital part of our mix. The\nlarge reactors that dot the landscape provide reliable,\nemissions-free power to communities across our country. Our\nnation's nuclear industry is critically important but it also\nfaces a number of challenges, and one that has impacted it\nsince the first reactors began operation is nuclear waste\ndisposition.\nBeginning with the passage of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act\nin 1982, Congress has attempted several times to address the\nback end of the fuel cycle. In an effort to resolve an earlier\nstalemate, the Federal Government was supposed to begin taking\ntitle to used fuel and moving it to a repository at Yucca\nMountain in Nevada, beginning in 1998. The Federal Government's\nfailure to deliver on this promise is now costing taxpayers up\nto $2 million per day.\nThis hearing is an opportunity for us to consider our next\nsteps on nuclear waste. Do we continue to delay in the face of\nstalemate over Yucca, or do we try to find another path forward\nfor used fuel storage, especially for communities that are\nmaintaining sites with only used fuel casks left on hand, with\nthe rest of the plant decommissioned?\nIn 2010, then Secretary of Energy, Steven Chu, convened the\nBlue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to conduct a\ncomprehensive review of policies for managing the back end of\nthe fuel cycle. The Commission's report included a number of\nrecommendations and led to the introduction of the Nuclear\nWaste Administration Act. Over the years, this legislation has\nbeen led by a number of members, including Senators Wyden and\nAlexander, both on this Committee. I have been a sponsor of the\nlegislation all along with Senators Alexander and Feinstein, my\npartners on the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee,\nfor multiple Congresses, now.\nWe have been at this for a while, and I think it is\nprobably fair to say we would like to put something behind us\nat some point in time here sooner rather than later. Our\nlegislation aims to move the process forward so that we can\nfinally move used fuel to a permanent repository. Our bill\ncreates a Nuclear Waste Administration to oversee consent-based\nsiting for interim storage and an additional repository that\ncould be located in states and communities that want it. Our\nbill also prioritizes the removal of orphaned used fuel at\ndecommissioned reactor sites for temporary storage at\nconsolidated sites.\nOur bill is S. 1234. I wish it was as easy as one, two,\nthree, four. We know it requires some updates and that there\nare a number of ideas to improve specific sections, so I\nwelcome those. I look forward to the testimony from our\ndistinguished panel this morning, but I would also welcome\nthoughts and comments from others.\nUltimately, I hope we can all agree that it is long, long,\npast time to figure this out and the sooner we find a path\nforward, the better. It has been six years now since I and\nothers cosponsored this legislation. We are in the same place.\nWe are effectively in the same place when it comes to the back\nend of the fuel cycle as when we introduced that legislation\nsix years ago. But in that time we have seen tremendous\nprogress in the area of nuclear with our advanced nuclear\nreactors. The United States has the ability to lead the world\non some of these technologies, but without a solution on\nnuclear waste, I believe that we are less likely to realize our\nfull potential there. We are here today to start, or perhaps we\nneed to say restart, the conversation.\nI know that Chairman Barrasso has a bill on nuclear waste\nin his EPW Committee. He is keen to move forward on it. I am\nglad to see that we have some renewed interest across Congress\nto address the challenge.\nIt is a good thing that we have multiple options on the\ntable. I think this is a positive development, and I sincerely\nhope that we can move forward on nuclear waste after decades of\ninaction.\nWith that, I turn to my Ranking Member and friend, Senator\nManchin.\nSTATEMENT OF HON. JOE MANCHIN III,\nU.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA\nSenator Manchin. Chair Murkowski, thank you for having a\nhearing on the Nuclear Waste Administration Act, and I want to\nthank all of our witnesses for being here today who will\nprovide us with ideas of how to move forward and break our\nnuclear repository impasse.\nNuclear energy will continue to be an important part of our\nnation's energy mix. It is reliable, especially in adverse\nweather. The fact is, it is the nation's largest zero emission\npower source which means that it is a powerful tool in our\nfight to mitigate climate change and move toward a zero\nemissions economy.\nWe will continue to rely on nuclear, thus we must work on a\nsolution to dispose of nuclear waste. I believe this bill\nprovides a solid foundation to work from which originated with\nthe bipartisan Blue Ribbon Commission on America's nuclear\nfuture.\nBut I think there is an agreement among us that changes\nmust be made to the current text before moving forward.\nProviding an equitable policy path forward for site selection\nis something that I support as the inequity in the site\nselection is a large part of the current impasse.\nSince the National Academy of Sciences 1957 report\nrecommending deep geologic disposal for highly radioactive\nwaste, it is clear what we need to do with the nuclear waste.\nThe prudent and responsible thing to do is to bury this waste\ndeep in the earth to protect the environment and public for\ngenerations to come. Unfortunately, the path to achieve this is\nnot entirely clear.\nI look forward to hearing from our panel today and from my\ncolleagues, many of whom represent constituencies that deal\nwith nuclear waste on a day-to-day basis.\nIn particular, I want to thank Chairman Murkowski and\nSenator Cortez Masto for their ongoing leadership on this\nissue. If we have learned anything in the past 30 years, it is\nthat social and political concerns need to be taken into\naccount to site and construct a repository. That is not to say\nthat technical considerations are not important, but I trust\nthe highly skilled individuals at the national labs and their\npartners to solve issues that we will face in constructing\nstorage solutions at whatever site or sites that are selected.\nWhat Congress should focus on are the mechanisms that can\ndrive buy-in from communities. Other countries in the world\nhave success by creating an organization that is separate from\nan agency or governing body but still regulated by the\ngovernment to work with communities to build a repository in\ntheir respective backyards.\nIn 1987 Congress decided to not go with the original\nNuclear Waste Policy Act language that directed the Department\nof Energy to characterize several sites and then make a\nrecommendation. Instead, due to the price tag associated with\nthe characterization of several sites, Congress instead\nlegislated this site choice. This action politicized the site\nselection process while simultaneously discrediting the Federal\nGovernment.\nIt is my hope that following the markup of this bill, it\nwill be equitable in how it considers all sites so when a site\nor sites are selected, we know it was a fair process and can\nmove forward accordingly.\nLet us not forget that there is urgency to this issue.\nSpent fuel pools such as reactors are at capacity and in need\nto mitigate carbon emission and ensures that reactors will\ncontinue to operate in this country for decades to come. On top\nof that, failing to act means that the Federal Government is\nracking up more liability to be paid to the utilities to store\nthis waste in their own private storage facilities adjacent to\nthe reactors.\nSo the taxpayer is on the hook here to the tune of about $2\nmillion a day with an estimated overall liability of $34.1\nbillion. Like it or not, this means that we already have a de\nfacto interim storage program in this country that is\ninefficient and lacks cost-effectiveness.\nWhile we don't have any nuclear waste in West Virginia, nor\ndo we have nuclear reactors, I am invested in working with my\ncolleagues on this issue because preserving and growing nuclear\npower is key to addressing the climate crisis.\nI want to share with you. The Chairman and I had an\nopportunity to spend some time with Bill Gates and he went\nthrough boom, boom, boom, country, by country, by country that\nhas nuclear power, all going to zero in a time and era when we\nwant to have zero emissions. Something has to be done, and we\nneed to act urgently.\nOnce again, I would like to thank Chairman Murkowski for\nholding this hearing at the most appropriate time and I think\nmuch needed, not just for the United States of America, but for\nthe world.\nThank you.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator Manchin.\nLet's turn now to our panel. We have a very distinguished\npanel, as I mentioned.\nWe are joined this morning by Maria Korsnick, who is the\nPresident and CEO of Nuclear Energy Institute, NEI. You have\nbeen before the Committee many times. We welcome you back.\nMr. Wayne Norton is the Chair for the Decommissioning Plant\nCoalition Steering Committee, also President and CEO of the\nYankee Atomic Electric Company. We appreciate you being here\nthis morning.\nSteven Nesbit is the Chair of the American Nuclear Society,\nNuclear Waste Policy Task Force. We thank you for your\nleadership with that important task force.\nGeoffrey Fettus is the Senior Attorney at the Nuclear,\nClimate and Clean Energy Program for the Natural Resource\nDefense Council, NRDC. We welcome you to the Committee.\nAnd Dr. John Wagner is with us from one of our national\nlabs. He is the Associate Laboratory Director for Nuclear\nScience and Technology Directorate at the Idaho National Lab\n(INL). We appreciate your leadership in these spaces as well.\nWe will begin with you, Ms. Korsnick. If you can provide\nyour comments to the Committee, we ask that you try to keep\nyour comments to about five minutes. Your full statements will\nbe included as part of the record. When the full panel has\nconcluded, we will have an opportunity for questions. Thank\nyou.\nSTATEMENT OF MARIA KORSNICK, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE\nOFFICER, NUCLEAR ENERGY INSTITUTE\nMs. Korsnick. Great, thank you very much.\nI'm Maria Korsnick, President and CEO of the Nuclear Energy\nInstitute.\nChairman Murkowski and Ranking Member Manchin, I greatly\nappreciate the opportunity to provide testimony of the Nuclear\nWaste Administration Act of 2019. NEI sincerely appreciates the\nCommittee's deliberate effort to develop an effective federal\nused fuel management program.\nSince this bill was first introduced in 2013, several\nthings have changed. Because of a court order, the Department\nof Energy has reduced the nuclear waste fee fund to zero. The\nNuclear Regulatory Commission technical staff has also\ncompleted reviews of the Yucca Mountain licensing application\nconcluding that Yucca Mountain complies with all regulation.\nFinally, private initiatives are now underway to develop\nconsolidated storage facilities into states.\nNuclear energy is the largest and most efficient source of\ncarbon-free electricity in the United States. Currently, 97\ncommercial nuclear power plants in 29 states provide nearly 20\npercent of America's electricity and more than half of the\nemissions-free electricity. These reactors are carbon-free\nworkhorses essential to addressing climate change in any\nrealistic manner. That said, the advanced reactors of tomorrow\nin the U.S. operating fleet at large are continually subjected\nto reputational damage because Congress, for two decades now,\nhas played politics with the issue of used fuel.\nIt's vitally important that the U.S. remain a global leader\nin the commercial nuclear arena, and yet we are the only major\nnuclear nation without a used fuel management program. The U.S.\nnuclear industry has upheld its end of the bargain at sites in\n35 states around the country, commercial used fuel is safely\nstored and managed awaiting pick up by the Federal Government\nwhich was scheduled for 1998.\nIn addition, the nuclear waste fund, which was set up to\nfinance the development of a national repository, currently has\nover $41 billion in its coffers which has been contributed by\nelectricity consumers and nuclear generation companies. Each\nyear over $1.5 billion more in interest accumulates in the\nfund. And finally, each day we don't have a solution, does cost\ntaxpayers $2.2 million in damages, the single largest liability\npaid out of the judgment fund year after year. It's really time\nto solve this, and I'm excited to talk about how that can be\nachieved.\nWe need a durable used fuel program. We must allow the\nscience, not the politics, to guide us forward. But let me be\nclear, Congressional action is necessary and three important\npoints must be addressed.\nFirst, we need to answer on the Yucca Mountain license\napplication. DOE submitted the application to the NRC more than\na decade ago, and Congress directed the NRC to issue a decision\nin 2012. This deadline, like too many, was missed because DOE,\nwithout basis, shut down the Yucca Mountain project. For the\nsake of the communities holding stranded used fuel wishing to\nredevelop their sites, we must move forward and allow Nevada's\nconcerns with Yucca Mountain to be heard by NRC's independent\nadministrative judges. This will allow a licensing decision to\nbe determined based on its scientific merits rather than\npolitics.\nSecond, as a licensing process of Yucca Mountain moves\nforward, interim storage can play an important role in helping\nmove spent fuel away from reactor sites. Moving interim storage\nin parallel with the Yucca Mountain project helps to alleviate\nstate and local concerns that interim storage will become a de\nfacto disposal facility. This point was highlighted recently in\na letter by New Mexico Governor, Lujan Grisham. That said, I'm\npleased interim storage is addressed in S. 1234, the Nuclear\nWaste Administration Act. I strongly believe interim storage\ncan be successful if moved in parallel with the Yucca Mountain\nlicensing.\nAnd finally, the nuclear industry and electricity consumers\naround the country have paid their fair share to address the\nback end of the fuel cycle. But S. 1234 was originally drafted\nprior to the court mandated prohibition on the fee, and I want\nto strongly convey the importance of not prematurely re-\nimposing the nuclear waste fee, especially given the\nsubstantial balance and large investment interest which accrues\nannually.\nThe industry believes that the fee should not be reinstated\nuntil (1) the annual expense for the program's ongoing projects\nexceed the annual investment and come on the fund, and (2) the\nprojected life cycle cost demonstrates that the fee must be\nreinstated to achieve full cost recovery over the life of the\nprogram.\nThe fact that we are here today considering this\nlegislation is a positive step in the right direction, and I\nsincerely appreciate the Committee's motivation to find a\ndurable solution.\nWe look forward to continuing to work with each and every\none of you to reach bipartisan consensus on the best approach\nfor long-term management of the nation's used fuel.\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions.\n[The prepared statement of Ms. Korsnick follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Thank you.\nMr. Norton, welcome.\nSTATEMENT OF WAYNE NORTON, CHAIR, DECOMMISSIONING PLANT\nCOALITION STEERING COMMITTEE, AND PRESIDENT & CEO, YANKEE\nATOMIC ELECTRIC COMPANY\nMr. Norton. Good morning, Chairman Murkowski, Ranking\nMember Manchin and members of the Committee. My name is Wayne\nNorton. I'm the President and CEO of Yankee Atomic Electric\nCompany with responsibility for Maine Yankee, Connecticut\nYankee and Yankee Rowe nuclear facilities.\nThe three nuclear plants at my sites are fully\ndecommissioned but for the storage facilities for the spent\nfuel and graded and Class C waste produced during our operating\nlife.\nEach company is undergoing litigation with the Department\nof Energy for monetary damages resulting from its partial\nbreach of contract. To date, the courts have awarded my\ncompanies damages of approximately $575 million, claims that\nnow encompass virtually all cost for the management of our\ncompanies and the fuel storage facilities.\nIn addition, I serve as the Chair of the Decommissioning\nPlant Coalition (DPC) Steering Committee. And as such, I want\nto express our appreciation for this invitation to appear\nbefore you today on behalf of the Coalition and would ask that\nour full statement, excuse me, be read into the part of the\nrecord.\nWe are here today, in part, because the failure of the\nFederal Government to make good on its commitment is creating a\nspent fuel management burden across the increased number of\nstates and localities. This delay in performance by the\ngovernment has created a situation whereby communities across\nthe nation are becoming the unanticipated home for interim\nstorage of spent nuclear fuel.\nIn New England alone there are five sites in four states\nthat are providing indefinite storage of this material, even\nthough the electric ratepayers in that region have met their\nobligations and paid upward of $3 billion into the nuclear\nwaste fund.\nMembers of the Decommissioning Plant Coalition have adopted\na formal position statement that emphasizes our support for an\nintegrated nuclear waste program that provides for the timely\nand safe solution to removing this material from our sites.\nMany of these positions are captured in the recommendations of\nthe Blue Ribbon Commission and in Senate 1234, the Nuclear\nWaste Administration Act.\nI'd like to focus on two issues relative to the Blue Ribbon\nCommission recommendations and Senate 1234. One, consolidate\ninterim storage, and two, funding reform.\nAs suggested by the Blue Ribbon Commission, Senate 1234\ncalls for a consolidated interim storage program as part of an\nactive repository siting and licensing effort. Given that\nCongress has not funded the current repository program for\nalmost a decade, given the current federal and state tension\nrelative to the repository program and given the future funding\nconstraints and mounting taxpayer liabilities, we at the DPC\nalso believe the most effective and timely path to remedy the\ngovernment's default lies with such a program.\nWe appreciate the fact that Senate 1234 does not prohibit\nthe commencement of fuel movement to CIS facility prior to\nfinal action on the repository licensing application. Based on\nthe most credible estimates for this licensing action, it seems\nclear that a consolidated interim storage facility license will\nlikely be granted first and the explicit linkage between the\ntwo could unduly delay the anticipated title transfer and fuel\nacceptance, a key to reducing ongoing taxpayer liability.\nTitle IV of Senate 1234 is a clear effort to correct our\nmajor policy concern relative to the sufficient and reliable\nfunding of the program. The establishment of a new working\ncapital fund is clear movement in a direction that the DPC\nsupports. However, it does not fully resolve the continued risk\nof annual appropriations and, perhaps more importantly, it\nleaves unresolved, the matter of $40 billion already funded\ninto the nuclear waste fund.\nIn conclusion, along with many of our other national\norganizations which you'll hear from today, the DPC has\nrepeatedly called for the need for urgent action by Congress to\nestablish an integrated national nuclear waste program.\nContinued inaction is now costing American taxpayers, as\nyou've heard today, approximately $2.2 million a day and the\nratepayers of New England and this nation deserve to see the\ntens of billions of dollars, already collected, used for its\nintended purpose.\nMadam Chairman, Ranking Member Manchin and members of the\nCommittee, the DPC deeply appreciates your interest in this\nissue. We are encouraged by your legislative initiative and the\nattention you have brought through the conduct of this hearing.\nThank you for the opportunity to testify today. I'd be glad\nto answer any questions.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Norton follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Norton.\nMr. Nesbit, welcome.\nSTATEMENT OF STEVEN P. NESBIT, CHAIR, NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY TASK\nFORCE, ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN NUCLEAR SOCIETY\nMr. Nesbit. Thank you, Chairwoman Murkowski, Ranking Member\nManchin and members of the Committee. I appreciate the\nopportunity to testify on behalf of the American Nuclear\nSociety (ANS). ANS represents 10,000 men and women who work\nevery day to provide clean energy, detect and cure cancer\nthrough nuclear medicine, develop systems to power deep space\nexploration and enable the many other beneficial applications\nof the atom.\nWe applaud the introduction of the Nuclear Waste\nAdministration Act of 2019 as a serious effort to break the\npolitical log jam that prevents the effective management of\nnuclear waste in the U.S. To the detriment of the American\npeople, the Federal Government is approaching a decade of\ninexcusable inaction in this critical area, an impending\nanniversary that should spur Congress and the Administration to\naction.\nTo be clear, used nuclear fuel is being stored safely today\nand poses no immediate danger to the public; however, the lack\nof progress on a geologic repository has clearly endangered\nnuclear power's potential to address our long-term energy and\nenvironmental objectives.\nIn particular, advanced reactor developers, men and women,\nwho are earnestly striving to meet global demand for emissions-\nfree, reliable energy are most impacted by the question, what\nabout the waste?\nI will turn now to discuss several key provisions of S.\n1234 along with other governmental actions that we believe can\nbegin addressing that very fundamental question.\nWe endorse the initiation of a search for a geologic\nrepository site other than Yucca Mountain as required by\nSection 306 of the proposed legislation. Make no mistake about\nit, ANS strongly supports the timely completion of Yucca\nMountain licensing; nevertheless, if Yucca Mountain doesn't\nbecome operational, our waste will have to go somewhere.\nConsolidated interim storage by itself is not the solution, and\nthe country deserves a better understanding of what options are\nrealistically available.\nTo enable repository siting, the government needs to update\nseveral regulations to reflect scientific advances and lessons\nlearned over the past decades. In particular, the nation's\ngeneric environmental standard for geologic repositories, 40\nCFR Part 191, lacks transparency, is out of date and is\ninconsistent with international guidelines.\nWe endorse a consolidated interim storage program with\npriority for fuel at shut down plants as authorized by Section\n305. However, Congress should understand that success in this\narea is unlikely without a credible repository program.\nANS supports a new independent entity to manage high level\nwaste but has some concerns with a new government agency\nproposed entitled to the NWAA. We suggest continued\nconsideration be given to the public corporation model.\nHigh level waste funding reform is essential. Title IV of\nthe bill takes a step in the right direction by improving\naccess to future contributions to the Nuclear Waste Fund. The\nCommittee should also consider incorporating practical\nprovisions to allow an empowered management entity to use the\nexisting balance of the fund.\nThe approach to consent-based siting of nuclear waste\nmanagement facilities described in Sections 305 and 306 appear\nreasonable; however, it is an open question if a process with\nall parties having an absolute veto can succeed in our system\nof government. Additional information on these points and\nothers is provided in my written testimony.\nIn closing, ANS suggests three principles for future\naction. First, make real progress by focusing on achievable\ntasks. Create a viable management organization with the\nnecessary resources that can work without undue political\ninterference. Empower that organization to complete Yucca\nMountain licensing, investigate a second repository site and\nmove forward on consolidated interim storage. Initiate the\ndevelopment of up-to-date repository regulations for sites\nother than Yucca Mountain. Engage with Nevada and other\npotential host states and communities.\nSecond, seek to combine the concepts of ``consent'' and\n``benefit.'' In addition to money from the Nuclear Waste Fund,\nthe Federal Government has many means of providing\ninfrastructure improvements, federal land, educational\nopportunities and other means of support to states and\ncommunities interested in exploring a partnership on the\nmanagement of nuclear material. Make those potential benefits\nabundantly clear from the beginning.\nThird, empower our scientists and engineers. Congress must\naddress the legal and administrative issues associated with\nnuclear waste. But we will not succeed if we allow politics to\noverwhelm good science. Act based on real risk, not perceived\nrisk. We must give our best and brightest nuclear professionals\nthe opportunity to take on this challenge with some degree of\nindependence, funding and flexibility.\nI thank you again for the opportunity to testify and stand\nready to answer your questions. I yield back the remainder of\nmy time.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Nesbit follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Nesbit. We appreciate that.\nMr. Fettus, welcome.\nSTATEMENT OF GEOFFREY H. FETTUS, SENIOR ATTORNEY, NATURAL\nRESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL, INC.\nMr. Fettus. Thank you, Chairman Murkowski and Ranking\nMember Manchin and members of the Committee. Thank you for the\nopportunity to present NRDC's views.\nChairman Murkowski started the hearing perfectly when she\nsaid we're in the same place. We trust this can be a new\nbeginning with more than 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel in\nmore than half of our states and reactors moving to\ndecommissioning, we need to reset the process. S. 1234 however,\nwill not solve the current stalemate and won't lead toward\nworkable solutions; therefore, we oppose it in its current\nform.\nFor more than 50 years Congress has offered and even passed\nbills that would restart the Yucca licensing process or kick\nopen a door in New Mexico or Utah for an interim storage site.\nIn doing those things, S. 1234 severs any meaningful link\nbetween storage and disposal and excludes Nevada from the\nconsent process it sets up. This won't work. And such efforts\nhave failed in Tennessee, in Kansas, Nevada, Utah and\neverywhere else. Another such attempt restarts litigation and\ncontroversy and the likely result is the continued stalemate\nwe've been in.\nSeven years ago, a bipartisan Blue Ribbon Commission keenly\ndescribed why past attempts failed. That Commission wisely\nasserted we can't keep doing the same thing. Congress must\ncreate a process that allows any potential host state to\ndemonstrate consent or, for that matter, non-consent.\nSo rather than spend more of your valuable time on the\nspecifics of why this won't work, they're all in the written\ntestimony, I put before you a durable, meaningful, reset of how\nwe can manage and dispose of nuclear waste and how we can\nreally achieve consent. The solution could be summed up simply.\nGive EPA and the states power under well-established\nenvironmental statutes so that they can set the terms for how\nmuch and on what conditions they could host a disposal site.\nRadioactive waste is stranded at sites across the country\nand will remain so because the Atomic Energy Act treats\nradioactive waste as a privilege pollutant. The Act preempts\nthe regulatory authority of EPA and the states, exempting\nradioactivity from hazardous waste law and sizable portions of\nthe Clean Water Act. It ignores the vital role states play in\naddressing other environmental pollutants.\nSenator Manchin talked of a mechanism that can drive buy-\nin. Our government is at its strongest when each player's role\nis respected. As an example, the years of wrangling over what\nstandards should be set for cleanup at our massively\ncontaminated nuclear weapon sites, such as those in Washington\nor South Carolina, is made exponentially worse by DOE's self-\nregulatory status which the Atomic Energy Act ordains with\nthese exemptions.\nThe same is true with commercial spent fuel where any state\nthat is targeted to receive nuclear waste looks to be on the\nhook for the entire burden of the nation's spent fuel. State\nconsent and public acceptance of potential repository sites\nwill never be willingly granted unless and until power on how,\nwhen and where waste is disposed of is shared rather than\ndecided simply by federal fiat.\nThere's only one way consent can happen consistent with our\ncooperative federalism. Specifically, Congress can finally\nremove the Atomic Energy Act's anachronistic exemptions from\nour bedrock environmental laws. Our hazardous waste and clean\nwater laws must include full authority over radioactivity and\nnuclear waste facilities so that EPA and, most importantly, the\nstates can assert direct regulatory authority.\nRemoving these exemptions will not magically solve this\npuzzle and create a final repository, but I think it can work\nfaster than what we have now because it will open a path\nforward that respects each state rather than offering up the\nlatest one for sacrifice. The Texas and New Mexico events of\nthe last several weeks demonstrate this.\nWhy will NRDC's plan work and why does this provide a\nbetter chance than S. 1234? Because a state can say no. It can\nalso say, yes. And it can set the terms for how it will receive\nthe waste and, importantly, not be on the hook for the entire\nburden because a state can protect its citizens and\nenvironment, limit what comes into the state. Such a new regime\nwould allow for the thorough technical review on the ability of\nany site to meet strict, protective standards unlike the years\nof fighting that have been the hallmark of this process. And\njust as important, that fundamental sharing of power can result\nin public acceptance of solutions.\nWe've seen these bills before. Each has been a mirror of\nthe last. It's time to try something that has a proven track\nrecord of addressing other controversial topics.\nIf you want to garner the consent the Blue Ribbon\nCommission deemed necessary, you have to give EPA and the\nstates regulatory authority under environmental law. It's time\nto regulate nuclear waste the same way as every other pollutant\nwith EPA and delegated states taking the lead under our\nfoundational environmental statutes.\nThank you again for having me here today, and I look\nforward to answering your questions.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Fettus follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Fettus.\nLet's go to views from the Idaho National Lab. Dr. Wagner.\nSTATEMENT OF DR. JOHN WAGNER, ASSOCIATE LABORATORY DIRECTOR,\nNUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DIRECTORATE, IDAHO NATIONAL\nLABORATORY\nDr. Wagner. Chairman Murkowski, Ranking Member Manchin and\nmembers of the Committee, it's an honor to be here with you\ntoday.\nI want to particularly thank Senators Murkowski, Feinstein\nand Alexander for sponsoring the significant legislation and\ntheir persistent efforts to make progress on this critically\nimportant issue for the nation, in general, and for nuclear\nenergy, in particular.\nCurrently, I oversee INL's Nuclear Energy Research,\nDevelopment and Demonstration efforts, including R&D related to\nspent nuclear fuel storage, transportation and disposal.\nThroughout my career, I've been intimately involved in the\ntechnical issues around spent nuclear fuel storage,\ntransportation and disposal working in the private sector as\nwell as for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, supporting the\nNuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department of Energy on\nthese issues, including leading a DOE program to implement the\nBlue Ribbon Commission on America's nuclear future recommended\nnear-term actions which involved laying the groundwork for\nimplementing interim storage as well as the associated\ntransportation to support that.\nAs the nation's nuclear energy research development and\ndemonstration laboratory, INL is the leader in the effort to\nmaintain and expand the lives of America's nuclear reactor\nfleet. These safe, efficient and high performing systems\nproduce nearly 20 percent of the nation's electricity and more\nthan half of our carbon-free electricity. That's more than\nsolar, wind, hydro and geothermal combined.\nAt INL we also work with industry on innovative advanced\nreactor designs. This includes megawatt scale microreactors,\nsmall modular reactors and a variety of advanced designs that\noffer the potential for improved performance, greater inherent\nsafety features and approved applicability for certain market\napplications as well as reduced construction, licensing and\noperating costs.\nAs this Committee heard on April 30th, during a discussion\non the Nuclear Energy Leadership Act, or NELA, a strong and\nvibrant commercial nuclear industry is vital to the United\nStates environment, power grid reliability and security,\neconomy and national security. Accordingly, we must address\nsome major impediments to developing and deploying advanced\nnuclear reactors.\nCongress, to its credit, has begun this process by passing\ntwo important pieces of legislation, the Nuclear Energy\nInnovation Capabilities Act, or NEICA, and the Nuclear Energy\nInnovation and Modernization Act, NEIMA, and reintroduced a\nthird which I referred to earlier, NELA. Now it's time to\naddress the waste issue, an impediment to development of the\nnew advanced reactors as well as continued operation of the\nexisting plant in some cases.\nFirst and foremost, I want to be clear from a technical\nstandpoint. Spent nuclear fuel storage and transportation is\nsafe as evidenced by more than 50 years of safe and secure\noperations by the public and private sectors. We do not have a\nspent nuclear fuel safety crisis in this country.\nWe do, however, have issues caused by the lack of a\nsustained, coherent approach for nuclear waste and not having a\nfinal disposition solution. This has resulted in longer than\nanticipated storage, as you all know. The national laboratories\nand industry, in coordination with the Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission, are proactively identifying and addressing the\nassociated potential technical issues with this situation.\nMore worrisome though than the relatively minor technical\nrisk of extended storage are the socio-economic and community\nimpacts resulting from onsite storage at permanently shut down\nreactor sites. The cost, which has been referred to multiple\ntimes this morning already, of approximately $2.2 million per\nday for taxpayers which will only increase until the government\nbegins to take possession of the spent fuel and will also\nincrease as additional existing plants are shut down.\nAnd then finally, the negative impact on public acceptance\nof new nuclear energy which was also referred to earlier, given\nthe lack of progress to address the waste. In our mission at\nthe Idaho National Laboratory related to research, development\nand demonstration and ultimate deployment of advanced reactor\nsystems, we frequently encounter this issue of how in the world\ncan we talk about new nuclear reactors when we have not\naddressed the waste issue? Because of all this, an interim\nstorage facility can be viewed as an economic investment for\nthe nation that addresses these issues and provides a range of\nother benefits that have been identified in numerous studies,\nincluding the BRC report that I referred to earlier.\nFinally, I'd like to note that I'm encouraged that Senate\nbill 1234 identifies defense-related spent fuel under a\ncompliance agreement, as a priority at the discretion of the\nnew administrator. The Department of Energy at the INL site is\nresponsible for managing and storing a range of spent fuel,\nincluding defense-related spent fuel. This bill would enable a\nmeaningful storage alternative for those materials.\nI appreciate the opportunity to testify. I want to thank\nyou again for your attention to this important issue for our\nnation, and I look forward to answering any of your questions.\n[The prepared statement of Dr. Wagner follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Dr. Wagner, and thank each of you\nfor being here this morning and for what you are providing the\nCommittee.\nIt is clear that the reviews, the studies, everybody agrees\nwe have to deal with the permanent in order to get to interim.\nThe discussion about interim sites becoming de facto permanent,\nthat is kind of where we are, unfortunately, around the country\nwhich I don't think any of us believe is truly acceptable for\nthe long-term.\nWe are not the only nation that has nuclear waste to deal\nwith. It is not like this is a case of first impression here.\nThere has been reference, plenty of reference, to other nations\nand how they handle their nuclear waste. Finland and Sweden are\nheld out as good examples of areas where they have deep\ngeologic repository siting. They have a consent-based approach.\nMr. Nesbit, you mentioned in your recommendations to us\nthat there has to be consent and benefit tied together. What\nhave they been able to do successfully that we should be\nlooking to? Are their geologic formations different than ours\nand that is what gives them the leg up? Is it more that they do\nwith the consent-based? I am trying to figure out by looking to\nothers who have been more successful than we have, what we\nmight learn. And I throw that out to anybody here on the panel.\nMr. Nesbit, and then we will go to Mr. Fettus.\nMr. Nesbit. Well, first of all, it's not the geology. The\nUnited States is blessed with a vast number of different\ngeologic media which are all suitable for repository\ndevelopment. They have advantages, they have disadvantages, but\nin a way it may be a problem that we have so many options\navailable to us. In other countries they're smaller and they\nreally just have to concentrate on one option.\nThe other thing I'd like to point out is that in those\ncountries that have been successful so far in what you would\ncall a consent-based siting process, they do not have anything\nthat corresponds to the state government in the United States\nand that's just the nature of their governmental structure,\nSweden and Finland. It has been a challenge in the United\nStates siting waste facilities and typically the hang-up is at\nthe state level.\nThe Chairman. Your thoughts, Mr. Fettus?\nMr. Fettus. I would actually agree with a lot of what Mr.\nNesbit just said, so I hope the Committee notes that. That one,\nwe call for in my written testimony, a return to the USGS had\nstarted some superb work at looking at the vast, over 36 states\nand dozens and dozens of places around the country that have\npotential.\nBut I would urge the Committee to reflect on the fact that,\nnumber one, there is no country that has fully sited a deep\ngeologic repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level\nwaste, yet. Sweden and Finland are farther down the road, but\nfor, in great measure, precisely the reason that Mr. Nesbit\njust pointed out which is they don't have the tripartite system\nwe do of both a community, a state and the Federal Government.\nThey don't have that interlocutory layer.\nAnd if you want to solve it consistent with our\nenvironmental laws, we've always taken accord of the states.\nAnd so, that's the basis of my testimony.\nThe Chairman. I appreciate that.\nLet me ask you, Mr. Norton, what does it cost to maintain a\ndecommissioned plant that still has used fuel on its site on\naverage, just give me a range?\nMr. Norton. Thank you for the question, Senator.\nAt my sites, as you'll see in my written testimony, it's\napproximately $30 million a year combined between the three\nsites to maintain those facilities and the corporate structure\nassociated with it.\nThe Chairman. What is happening on the site right now? I\nmean, in terms of you have workers there that are just ensuring\nthat there is a level of safety. What is costing you $30\nmillion?\nMr. Norton. Well, the interesting part about our companies,\nSenator, is that, Madam Chairman, is that we're also managing\nour corporations and not just the storage of the spent fuel at\nour sites. I think if you just looked at spent fuel storage,\nthe cost would be closer to $6.5 million per site. But as the\ncourts have found in our cases, our corporation single asset\nutilities would have gone out of business had the government\nperformed.\nThe Chairman. Right.\nMr. Norton. So not only is our damages including the cost\nof safely and securely storing the fuel, but also to manage our\ncorporations and remain in existence until such time as the\ngovernment performs.\nThe Chairman. But about $6.5 million per site, on average.\nMr. Norton. Yeah, on average.\nThe Chairman. In order to transport spent fuel canisters,\ndo you anticipate that upgrades will be required to these sites\nas you look forward?\nMr. Norton. Well, I would expect across the nation, Madam\nChairman, that there would be upgrades required. And depending\non the facility, would depend on the significance of that.\nFor instance, the Department of Energy has been doing\nstudies, pre-planning studies, for de-inventorying these sites\nand looked at the transportation challenges, independent to\nmany of these sites, including the shutdown ones and including\nmy three. And in each of these sites is unique in those\nchallenges. And so, for instance, at Maine Yankee, there would\nbe minimal upgrades required at the site itself. The inventory\nreports have looked more broadly at the entire transportation\nroute. And I realize that the Department of Energy and others\nhave focused on that issue and should continue to focus on that\nissue. But, you know, the entire transportation pathway needs\nto be analyzed.\nSo, I think it's site specific, but I am certain that\nalmost every site in the nation would have to have some level\nof upgrade to start removing this material from their sites.\nThe Chairman. I think it is important for us to understand\nthat.\nLet me turn to Senator Manchin.\nSenator Manchin. Thank you, Madam Chairman.\nI think finding a solution to our nation's nuclear waste\nimpasse is critically important, and I think you all have\nbrought so much expertise to the table. I appreciate it very\nmuch.\nInstead of asking a question right now at the beginning of\nmy time, I am going to ask Senator Cortez Masto, since she has\nbeen leading this effort and has more skin in the game than any\nof us sitting here, I would like for her to explain a little\nbit what she is trying to achieve right now and how we can be\nof help.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you. Thank you, Ranking Member\nManchin for this opportunity. I know it is rare.\nChairman Murkowski, let me just say the recommendations\nprovided by the Blue Ribbon Commission, I believe, do provide\nus a blueprint to follow, particularly when employing a\nconsent-based method for site selection.\nMy state and what I am simply asking is that the State of\nNevada be included in this framework of this legislation to be\ntreated equally and fairly alongside all the other states. That\nis all we are asking. And I would like to ask you and Ranking\nMember Manchin to work with me as this bill proceeds.\nSenator Manchin. You have my assurance on that and all of\nyou all, I think, have basically expressed in your opening\nstatements that the site selection has to have a buy-in to\nwhere states can either say yea or nay and I think that is\nimportant. But we have to move forward.\nMr. Norton, if I can, I want to make, go back on Senator\nMurkowski. I want to understand the economics of what we are\ndealing with. Do you all get paid by the Federal Government for\nstorage onsite since it never did take the responsibility as\nfar as putting it in a repository?\nMr. Norton. Well, Senator, to be more clear, we have to sue\nto get that money.\nSenator Manchin. You have to sue to get the money.\nMr. Norton. Every five years we sue the Federal Government\nfor the previous four years of storage costs, go through the\nprocess.\nSenator Manchin. Okay, storage costs. You just said you are\nsuing and received $30 million when your actual cost is $6.5\nmillion.\nMr. Norton. I'm sorry, again Senator, I might have confused\nyou. I was trying to be clear. I think the differentiation of\nthe----\nSenator Manchin. Yes, the $23.5 million.\nMr. Norton. The difference between the actual cost to\nsafely and securely store it versus the cost that we have to\nincur at the full cost. So we have, I'm sorry.\nSenator Manchin. The cost you are incurring right now, you\nare incurring that cost by keeping onsite?\nMr. Norton. Yeah, we have an onsite storage component to\nour litigation and----\nSenator Manchin. Is it safe? Do you feel it is safe?\nMr. Norton. It is safe, yes.\nSenator Manchin. And I would assume since it is safe and\nyou are able to do it and we have had no incidents there, then\nthere is no urgency and maybe Congress has dragged its feet for\n30 years for that reason. It hasn't become a critical mass.\nDr. Wagner, you might want to talk on that, would all\nconsider it has been safe storage? I mean, what the\ncorporations are doing?\nDr. Wagner. Yes, your point is exactly right. It has\ncontinued to be safely stored, securely stored. And so----\nSenator Manchin. The public is not threatened?\nDr. Wagner. Exactly right.\nSo that's kind of a bit of a crux of the problem. We don't\nhave a crisis, per se, in terms of safety or security as the\nutility and the private sector has done, you know, an\noutstanding job in terms of safety and security----\nSenator Manchin. I am told, I guess, that some of these\nplants, I mean we have plants coming offline and we are talking\nabout in climate change and we are talking about decarbonizing.\nAnd Bill Gates raised the bar very high in saying, you know,\nyou think it is bad now, wait for another five or ten years,\nthey are going to, we are going to zero. We are not going to\nmore nuclear decarbonization energy. We are going to less.\nSo is it because you are running out of room? You have no\nplace to store it? Your capacity?\nMr. Fettus. No, Senator, it's not because they're running\nout of room.\nDry storage can be improved, and we have a whole set of\nsuggestions on hardened onsite storage that we think would work\nbetter while we get a repository program on track along the\nlines of what the BRC suggested and NRC's suggestion.\nAnd I would urge you, I think it's a long footnote three,\nyour staff can review in our testimony. The actual waste issue,\nhonestly, Senator, has not and is not what is holding up\nnuclear power's ability to compete in the market.\nWhat is holding up nuclear power's ability to compete in\nthe market are its gigantic upfront capital costs. The South\nCarolina reactors that are now in a $9 billion hole in the\nground at Summer and Vogtle, I think, is now pushing $28\nbillion for two new units. The likelihood of building new\nnuclear power is vanishingly unlikely in this country for a\nwhile.\nSenator Manchin. Let me ask this question then.\nThe existing nuclear power we have in decommissioned units\nthat have gone offline, could they have been restored? Could\nthey have been basically improved upon?\nI'm----\nMr. Fettus. It depends on how they went offline.\nMs. Korsnick. The plants that are in the marketplace right\nnow, the merchant plants that you're talking about, they're not\nshutting down relative to used fuel. Used fuel is a necessary\nissue that we need to address.\nSenator Manchin. Sure.\nMs. Korsnick. And as----\nSenator Manchin. Why are they shutting down? Cost?\nMs. Korsnick. It leads to building more nuclear plants and\npeople's concerns about creating additional waste when the\ncurrent waste is not being cared for.\nSenator Manchin. No, I think my question is, is that we are\ndecommissioning some nuclear plants.\nMs. Korsnick. That's correct.\nSenator Manchin. Are they, have they run their life cycle?\nMs. Korsnick. Not all of them, no.\nSenator Manchin. Could they be----\nMs. Korsnick. They're being shut down because in the\nmarketplace right now, the marketplace does not recognize the\ncarbon-free attribute of nuclear. It's competing with----\nSenator Manchin. So there is no value to carbon-free\nnuclear, is what you are saying?\nMs. Korsnick. Not in the marketplace there's not. There\nshould be and that would help.\nSenator Manchin. Are any of these plants in basically\ncontrolled PSCs or basically they are all merchant?\nMs. Korsnick. The ones that are shutting down, for the most\npart, are merchant, not all, but for the most part.\nSenator Manchin. And I think we have gone to the DOE asking\nfor some stability in that.\nMs. Korsnick. That's correct.\nSenator Manchin. Right? And that would be of utmost\nimportance to save some of these plants from going offline.\nMs. Korsnick. It would be very helpful.\nSenator Manchin. Thank you, Madam Chair.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator.\nBefore I turn to Senator Alexander, I wanted to respond to\nSenator Cortez Masto, because you asked a very direct question\nof me.\nKnow that I do understand the importance of this issue to\nyou, your delegation and to your constituency and I want to be\nvery clear that I am very open to working on this bill with\nyou, with Senator Manchin, and any other Senators that are\ninterested in working on it.\nSenator Alexander, Senator Feinstein and I introduced this\nbill understanding that changes are going to be needed to bring\nit in line with current policies. I am aware of the language\nthat you have offered along with Senator Rosen and Senator\nManchin and that you believe it could improve the bill. Know\nthat I look forward to discussing this language with you as we\nare moving forward, because I think we all want to find that\npractical path forward. So I look forward to that.\nLet me turn to Senator Alexander.\nSenator Alexander. Thank you, Madam Chairman, and thanks to\nthe witnesses.\nLet me see if I can get down to what I think the crux of\nthe problem is. We have a world concerned about climate change\nand the effect of carbon emissions on climate change and 60\npercent of the U.S. electricity that is carbon-free is nuclear\npower, and 11 nuclear plants are closing by 2025 and most of\nthem will close over the next several years for a variety of\nreasons and one of the reasons is we have nowhere to put the\nwaste, no place to put the waste offsite which the nuclear law\nrequires we do.\nAs a result of that, President Obama had a Blue Ribbon\nCommission that came up with several ways to move ahead\nincluding a new Yucca Mountain, in effect, a new permanent\nrepository, new interim storage and there are a couple of\nprivate interim storage sites.\nSo there are four places to put this waste that we are\ntalking about, waste that we have collected $40 billion from\nratepayers to store and that we are paying $2.5 million a day\nin damages because we are not doing what the law says we are\nsupposed to do. We have four tracks we could follow to do\nsomething: We could have a Yucca Mountain open, we could build\na new Yucca Mountain, we could have a public interim site, or\nwe could approve a private interim site.\nNow, the reason we don't have any of those is because some\npeople have said that if you can't do Yucca Mountain, you can't\ndo anything else.\nSo I am going to ask each one of you, do you agree with\nthat?\nMs. Korsnick, do you agree that if we can't agree in the\nCongress to proceed ahead with Yucca Mountain, that we should\nstop trying to build a new Yucca Mountain, consent-based, a new\npublic interim site, consent-based, or approving a new private\nsite?\nMs. Korsnick. We need a long-term storage answer as well as\na short-term.\nSenator Alexander. No, that's not my--my question is if we\ncan't do Yucca Mountain should we stop doing anything else?\nShould we stop trying anything else?\nMs. Korsnick. I think we've spent an awful lot of money on\nYucca, and I think it should move forward with----\nSenator Alexander. That is not my question. My question is\nif we can't do Yucca Mountain, which we have not been able to\ndo for 35 years, should we stop doing all the other things that\nthis legislation and the Blue Ribbon Commission said we could\ndo?\nMs. Korsnick. No, we should move forward.\nSenator Alexander. We should move forward.\nMr. Nesbit? Or let me just go down the line. If we can't do\nYucca Mountain, should we stop trying any of these other\ntracks?\nMr. Norton. Senator, we should not.\nMr. Nesbit. I agree, Senator. I also think the country\nshould get a return on the $15 billion.\nSenator Alexander. My question is should we stop if we\ncan't do Yucca Mountain? Should we stop trying any other\nsolution?\nMr. Nesbit. No, sir, we should not stop trying. But we\nshould complete the licensing.\nMr. Fettus. I agree, we should keep trying and we laid out\na pathway in our testimony for you, Senator.\nSenator Alexander. Yes.\nDr. Wagner. No, sir.\nSenator Alexander. Well, I mean, that is the issue in the\nappropriations process. I believe we should finish Yucca\nMountain but what happens is the Senate won't agree to fund the\nnext year's funding of Yucca Mountain which is only to\ndetermine whether it is safe or not. And so, the House won't\nagree to move ahead with a new repository, a new public site, a\nnew private interim site. That does not make any sense at all.\nI mean, we ought to try all four tracks. That is what the Blue\nRibbon Commission said.\nLet me go to the private site. I think the private site is\nthe site that is most likely to be open first, even if we were\nto move ahead with Yucca Mountain.\nMs. Korsnick, the language of the bill that is proposed has\nlanguage that was written for Yucca Mountain which says, ``This\nAct shall not affect any proceeding or any application for any\nlicense or permit pending before the Commission on the date of\nenactment of this Act.'' That basically said we are\nsidestepping Yucca Mountain. We are moving ahead with these\npermanent repository and public interim sites. But today, that\nmight affect the two pending private sites.\nWould it be your opinion that the bill, as written, would\nmean that the provisions of the bill, including the consent-\nbased procedures, would not apply to the pending applications\nfrom New Mexico and Texas for a private site?\nMs. Korsnick. That's how we read it, that they're already\npending applications so they would be excluded.\nSenator Alexander. Anyone else have an opinion on that?\nMr. Fettus. That's precisely right, Senator. You asked the\nright question. Texas and New Mexico would both be barred from\nthe consent process, clearly, by the terms of the bill.\nSenator Alexander. I would assume from your testimony you\nthink they should be?\nMr. Fettus. We think that would put us in precisely the\nsame stalemate that's put us here for 50 years.\nSenator Alexander. Ms. Korsnick, in your testimony you\nthought the private sites, because of the promise they have,\nought to have priority, is that correct?\nMs. Korsnick. We do think they should have priority.\nThe challenge with the private sites right now is they\ndon't want to be the de facto, long-term storage which keeps it\nconnected to a long-term storage answer.\nSenator Alexander. Well, my own view, Madam Chairman and\nMr. Ranking Member, is that the private sites are our best\noption, our fastest option. They should have priority and we\nshould consider whether the consent-based provisions which,\napparently, do not now apply to them, should and if they do,\nwhether that would slow down the private sites which hold so\nmuch promise.\nThank you for your time.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator Alexander.\nI truly appreciate your commitment to working and pushing\nall of us toward solutions here.\nSenator Heinrich.\nSenator Heinrich. Ms. Korsnick, you mentioned that the\nmarket right now just does not value carbon-free nuclear power.\nHas NEI endorsed putting a price on carbon as a way to\nbuild that value into the market?\nMs. Korsnick. Yes, we've had discussions about a variety of\nways to value nuclear in the marketplace. In the states, for\nexample, there are zero emission credits that have been\ndiscussed.\nSenator Heinrich. Right.\nMs. Korsnick. And we have supported that in New York and\nIllinois.\nSenator Heinrich. But have you endorsed putting a price on\ncarbon as a way to pull that in?\nMs. Korsnick. Those zero emission credits actually do,\nplace it----\nSenator Heinrich. As a federal--at the federal level,\nnationally.\nMs. Korsnick. We have conversations around that.\nSenator Heinrich. You have had conversations, but you have\nnot actually taken a position on that?\nMs. Korsnick. From a member perspective there's different\nviews about whether or not a price on carbon would go forward.\nSenator Heinrich. No, I get that. I am just asking what\nyour position is as an organization. Has NEI endorsed putting a\nprice on carbon at the federal level?\nMs. Korsnick. Not an explicit tax on carbon.\nSenator Heinrich. Okay.\nMs. Korsnick. Value on carbon, yes.\nSenator Heinrich. Okay. It is not a complicated question.\nWhy shouldn't the pending sites be part of the consent-\nbased approach when we know that not using a consent-based\nprocess which, by the way, the Blue Ribbon Commission was\nadamant about, has been a path to failure over and over again\nas we see in Nevada.\nMs. Korsnick. Is your question around Nevada specifically?\nSenator Heinrich. No, I am asking why shouldn't pending\napplications also be part of a consent-based approach?\nMs. Korsnick. It was simply reflecting that as written,\nsince it says it's a pending application, that needs to be\nevaluated because they are----\nSenator Heinrich. Yes, so I am not asking about the\nlegislation. I am asking should we use a consent-based process\nfor all applications?\nMs. Korsnick. Yes, we're in support of consent-based\nprocess for applications.\nSenator Heinrich. So, Madam Chair, I guess I am a little\nfrustrated because we have been doing the same thing over and\nover for a long time and not getting somewhere. And I am\nactually, you know, I have spent enough time at a nuclear\nreactor when I was getting my engineering degree that I am\nactually quite proud of the work that I did in one of the\nlarger research reactors in the country.\nBut I think we have heard local input, state input, consent\ncalled just the politics. And I don't think, I think that is a\nmistake because the problem is, we have ignored the politics\nfor decades.\nAnd so, one of the things that is very concerning to me is\nthat if we move forward on interim sites, especially if it is\nwithout consent, and you have a consolidated storage facility\nthat is filled with waste and we never build the permanent\nsite, what recourse is the state going to have if a permanent\ndisposal facility is never built?\nI think we owe it to this conversation to answer those\nquestions before we expect somebody to take possession in what\nwould be a permanent, you know, what could effectively be a\npermanent situation.\nI want to enter a couple of letters into the record. I have\na letter here from Governor Lujan Grisham from New Mexico, and\nI have a letter from the State Land Commission of New Mexico,\nboth objecting to interim storage. I would just ask consent\nthat they be included in the record for the hearing.\nThe Chairman. They will be included as part of the record.\n[Letters objecting to interim storage follow:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nSenator Heinrich. Mr. Fettus, what should consent look\nlike?\nMr. Fettus. Consent should look like regulatory authority,\nas simple as that.\nTo the extent that there has been acceptance in New Mexico\nof WIPP.\nSenator Heinrich. Right.\nMr. Fettus. Transuranic geologic repository, the only\noperating one in the world.\nSenator Heinrich. Why do we have that? Why do we have\nconsent privileges?\nMr. Fettus. The only consent, well, it's a little\ncomplicated and it's not nearly the consent that needs to be\nthere and it's not the full regulatory authority but the state\nhas----\nSenator Heinrich. But the state has----\nMr. Fettus. ----hazardous waste permitting authority and\nthe state can shut the place down and set terms by which it can\noperate after it had a fire and an explosion that shut it down\nand contaminated it for several years.\nSenator Heinrich. And we reopened that facility which, I\nwill repeat, is the only, only, deep geological repository that\nhas been successfully built that I am aware of in this country\nbecause of the state's involvement. And so, I think we need to\nlook at that model and look at what you suggested in terms of a\ndifferent regulatory approach if we are going to get out of\ndoing the same thing and expecting a different outcome.\nMr. Nesbit. Senator, if I could interject.\nI'd just like to point out that I don't agree with Mr.\nFettus' intertwining the concept of regulatory authority with\nconsent. I think you can have consent.\nSenator Heinrich. But I do.\nMr. Nesbit. Okay, fair enough.\nBut I think that the regulatory authority that's present in\nthe United States is--can be handled in a separate manner. I\nthink that consent goes back to contracts.\nAnd if you look at the history of the nuclear waste matter,\nit is only because the generators of nuclear waste entered into\na contract with the Federal Government that was a two-way\ncontract, you pay money and you get something back, the waste\nremoved from your site. That if it wasn't for that contract,\nthen we would be an even a worse situation than we are today.\nThe Chairman. Senator Heinrich, I just want to reiterate\nwhat I mentioned to Senator Cortez Masto. When we introduced\nthis legislation, we did so knowing that we were laying down a\nmarker for conversation because, quite honestly, we need to\nrestart this.\nI appreciate the points that you have raised and they will\nbe part of this ongoing discussion here. I want to make sure\nthat colleagues know and understand, I don't view this bill as\nthe end-all, be-all, but we have to start or restart at some\npoint. So I thank you for that.\nLet's go to Senator Lee.\nSenator Lee. Thank you very much, Madam Chair.\nThe traditional forms of nuclear energy generated a whole\nlot more waste than many of the methods that we are talking\nabout at today's hearing. The sheer volume currently in interim\nstorage around the country and also the lack of a permanent\nstorage or permanent disposal solution are things that are\nfrequently cited as reasons why we should not continue to\ndevelop our nation's nuclear energy capabilities.\nMs. Korsnick, I have a question for you.\nDr. Wagner mentioned several small reactors. How much more\nefficiently would these small reactors use fuel than reactors\nin past decades? And could you describe how these new forms of\ngenerating nuclear energy could possibly change our need for\nnuclear waste storage going forward?\nMs. Korsnick. Yeah, so, I guess as you look forward,\nthere's a variety of different types of small modular reactors\nthat can be built, but some of the types of small modular\nreactors that can be built would actually be interested in\nusing a different type of fuel. And some of that fuel could be,\nin fact, what we consider used fuel today. So in any solution\nset that we put in, we should remind ourselves that we want it\nto be retrievable. There's 95 percent still good energy in what\nwe call used fuel. It's just in a different form. And some of\nthese reactors that are being looked at for tomorrow will be\nable to harvest that energy.\nSenator Lee. And we will be able to use it far below that\n95 percent threshold that you described.\nMs. Korsnick. That's correct.\nSenator Lee. How low would they go?\nMs. Korsnick. They should be able to use the majority of\nthat good energy. I would say, you know, you'll be down to\nmaybe the four to five percent ``that's left'' that would then\nneed to be stored.\nSenator Lee. Okay.\nAnd that brings up another topic. I don't know whether that\nplays into what happens then. Could it be reprocessed or\nrecycled? Is there another means of dealing with our need to\nhave a disposal site for spent fuel that could be addressed\nthrough recycling or reprocessing?\nIt is my understanding that other countries that have\nrelied on nuclear energy recycle their waste and that the U.S.\nhas even developed the technology to do so here in the United\nStates in a way that is deemed safe and clean.\nCan you describe the process of how nuclear fuel is\nrecycled and the history of why this process has been banned in\nthe United States?\nMs. Korsnick. Sure, so it, sort of, goes back to when we\nsaid there's a 95 percent still good energy in what we call\nused fuel. It's transformed. And so, instead of being, say\nuranium 235, it's turned into uranium 238 or it's turned into\nplutonium 239. So those isotopes can still release energy but\nthey, not in the current way in our current light water\nreactors.\nSo in recycling what you do is you essentially take the\nfuel apart and you isolate what's good and can be used again.\nSo that uranium, that plutonium, and it can then be mixed and\nyou can use it in current reactors, that's called MOX fuel, or\nyou can use it for other types of reactors. So again, it, sort\nof, closes the fuel cycle, if you will.\nYou're left with a very small amount that is not useful in\na fuel and France, as an example, reprocesses their fuel. They\nturn that into a glass and then you store that inert glass.\nSenator Lee. So the glass is inert?\nMs. Korsnick. That's correct.\nSenator Lee. It is not fissile at that moment, it is not\nemitting----\nMs. Korsnick. It's radioactive, but it's not useful for\nfuel.\nSenator Lee. Okay.\nMs. Korsnick. So it's stored in accordance with--it would\nbe in a deep geologic situation, but it would be a very small\namount.\nSenator Lee. So it reduces the overall volume of what is\nproduced?\nMs. Korsnick. That's correct. That's correct.\nSenator Lee. So why wouldn't we do that?\nMs. Korsnick. So in the United States, we've chosen not to.\nWe've chosen the fact that, and this was made in the Carter\nAdministration days, that the fact of reprocessing, they look\nat it as potential proliferation, even though there are many\nprocesses and things you could put in place to ensure that it's\ndone without any kind of proliferation concerns. But that's why\nthe United States doesn't currently go for reprocessing today.\nSenator Lee. So if that decision was made in the Carter\nAdministration, we are talking about 40 years ago or more.\nMs. Korsnick. That's correct.\nSenator Lee. What has changed since then that might cause\nus to need to reconsider that? Has the technology changed in\nsuch a way that what was perceived as dangerous would no\nlonger, necessarily, be deemed dangerous?\nMs. Korsnick. Well, I mean, I think we've proven on a lot\nof fronts that we have the capability of managing significant\nthings. The government manages plutonium on a regular basis, so\nit obviously can be done and can be done safely.\nSenator Lee. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nThank you, Madam Chair.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator.\nSenator Cortez Masto.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you, Madam Chair.\nFirst, I would like to enter into the record an analysis of\nthis bill made by the Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects and a\nstatement expressing concerns of this bill by my Nevada\ncolleague, Senator Jacky Rosen.\nThe Chairman. Those will be included as part of the record.\n[Analysis and Rosen statement follow:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you.\nI am sorry Senator Alexander had to leave. I do agree with\nhim. I think we need a comprehensive approach here. I think we\nneed to--it is safely stored what I am hearing now, spent\nnuclear fuel, and it is safely stored where it is. But we do\nneed a comprehensive approach for the future.\nBut here is the one thing that I am seeking and this is why\nI so respect Senator Alexander. In 1987, I believe it was,\nTennessee was able to successfully remove the Oak Ridge\nfacility as an interim storage facility, change the law, and\nnow in this bill Tennessee has equally the opportunity to say\nno like every other state, except Nevada. That is all I am\nlooking for, in my state, are those similar opportunities,\nparticularly with this bill it creates an equal consent-based\nsiting process for all states, except for Nevada.\nAnd let me just highlight for the record, Section 306(e)\nrequires the potential host state to veto or approve a site\nbefore they are fully informed of a site's local impact prior\nto initiating a review licensing process. That essentially\nleaves Yucca Mountain as the default sole repository. Section\n506(a) gives parity to all other states, except for Yucca\nMountain in Nevada, which the consent-based process would not\nbe applied to, but would be applied to states such as New\nMexico, Texas and Utah to be kept on the list without requiring\ntheir consent. And Section 509 eliminates the legal 70,000\nmetric ton limit of waste to be stored at a repository so if no\nstate wants to be a host, this guarantees all the waste goes to\nYucca Mountain.\nMy request is that we all be treated equally. I so\nappreciate, again, the conversation today. That is why Jacky\nRosen and I have submitted these recommended amendments to the\nCommittee to this bill that treats Nevada equally.\nLet me start with some of the questions and comments that I\nhave heard today.\nFirst of all, Mr. Fettus, let me ask you this. If we are to\nmove forward in a comprehensive approach, and I think we have\nall agreed that we do need that approach, what is the best way\nto rebuild the American people's confidence in the Federal\nGovernment's ability to provide safe, long-term storage of\nhigh-level nuclear waste?\nMr. Fettus. I think you've targeted the right issue,\nSenator, and that is confidence. And I'd also put it as trust.\nAnd we certainly support your idea of getting everybody treated\nequally under the consent.\nWe would take it a step farther in that if we just keep the\ncurrent system of trying to keep it as consent, everyone will\njust say no because the entire burden is on. That's what we're\ntrying to build, is a process where states and EPA can have\ntrust and confidence and say yes in our process. And that's the\nspecific point of our testimony.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you.\nMs. Korsnick, would NEI support the new Nuclear Waste\nAdministration Act, as created in this bill, if the NWA walked\naway from the Yucca Mountain project and demonstrated that a\nnew repository project could be done more efficiently and\nrapidly than Yucca Mountain? Yes or no?\nMs. Korsnick. Well, I guess I would reflect to say that we\nbelieve that Nevada does have a say in the process by\ncontinuing with the conversations around Yucca.\nSenator Cortez Masto. That was not my question. My question\nwas this. Under this Act, would the NEI support this Act if the\nNWA walked away from the Yucca Mountain project and\ndemonstrated that a new repository project could be done more\nefficiently and rapidly than Yucca Mountain? Would you support\nthat?\nMs. Korsnick. I don't see how another process could be done\nmore rapidly with all of the analysis that's already been done\non Yucca. But if you found such a magic place, yes, we could\nbe----\nSenator Cortez Masto. Well, DOE studies have shown that\nwalking away from Yucca Mountain and starting over with a\nrepository in salt or shale could save billions of dollars over\nthe life of the facility.\nSo, and this is the challenge I have had. We have had a\nstalemate over the last 32 years, and we have offered the\nopportunity to come in and work with us and find a solution for\nit. I think you have that today, but unfortunately what I see\nfrom the industry is the same old playbook and not willing to\neven admit there is an opportunity to move forward. There is\nnot even a willingness to talk about the potential new\ntechnology that can be utilized to address the safe storage,\nand that is my concern.\nWe need time now for everybody to come together and move\nforward on this issue.\nMs. Korsnick. We're happy to have those conversations.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator.\nSenator Risch.\nSenator Risch. Well, Madam Chairman, thank you for holding\nthis hearing today.\nYou know, I joined this Committee 11 years ago and we were\ntalking about this then. Unfortunately the discussion today\ndoes not sound a whole lot different than it did 11 years ago.\nThe Chairman. That is going to change.\nSenator Risch. Okay, going to change, thank you, Madam\nChairman and maybe your bill will get us there.\nFirst of all, let me say thank you for inviting Mr. Wagner\nhere. He is really the appropriate person to have here, which I\nwill address in a second.\nI am also sorry that Senator Alexander left, because I was\ngoing to say he is the smartest guy on the panel. He left\nTennessee and moved to Idaho and worked at Oak Ridge for 17\nyears, was it, Dr. Wagner? And now he is working at Idaho.\nSenator King. You are lucky Senator Alexander didn't hear\nthat.\nSenator Risch. Yes, oh, he will hear it.\n[Laughter.]\nAnyway, it is appropriate that he be here because the Idaho\nNational Laboratory, of course, is the birthplace of nuclear\nenergy in America and in the world, indeed.\nWe still have the three light bulbs that we lit, the first\nthree light bulbs lit with nuclear energy there. We don't use\nthem regularly, but they are still there.\nIn any event, because they were the birthplace of nuclear\nenergy, the site has been used for decades for various things\nin the nuclear energy business and in the nuclear arms\nbusiness. We became a waste site for a lot of the waste that\nwas developed during the Cold War.\nBut my point is this. In about the 1970s the State of Idaho\nwas unhappy with the Department of Energy because they were not\nproperly addressing, in our belief, that the waste should be\nhandled properly. As a result of that, we, in Idaho, sued the\nDepartment of Energy and eventually entered into a consent\ndecree with the Federal Government for cleanup at the Idaho\nNational Lab. And all of us who were governors following that\nstood shoulder-to-shoulder behind that agreement and have\nexecuted that agreement. And the Department of Energy, although\nrecalcitrant at the beginning, has now embraced the agreement.\nOf course, there has been a lot of turnover with the people who\nwere involved and everything. But the bottom line is this. We\nhave been very successful at the Idaho National Lab as far as\ncleanup is concerned. We have addressed virtually every problem\nthere successfully. We're not done yet.\nIsn't that correct, Dr. Wagner? Are we--we are a long ways\ndown the road though, fair statement?\nDr. Wagner. Absolutely.\nSenator Risch. Yes.\nAnd so, it is important that the people who have, and we\nhave had thousands of people, great people, over the years from\nall over the United States, from Idaho, who have worked on this\nand who are really smart at this. And we have proven that you\ncan deal with nuclear waste and it can be cleaned up and it can\nbe put into storage, semi-permanent, some temporary. But it has\nbeen done.\nSo it is discouraging after sitting here all these years\nand not really having moved the ball very far down the field.\nWe have done that in Idaho. This is a serious problem, but my\ngood friend from New Mexico says we have ignored the politics.\nGosh, I would really disagree with that. I mean, it becomes a\npolitical issue every time there is a Presidential campaign and\nNevada is in play, that becomes a political issue. So, and it\nis also true here. I have seen it over the years as the Senate\nraces develop in Nevada.\nThere has to be a better way of doing this and I thank you\nfor holding this hearing. Just as Dr. Wagner has done in Idaho,\nas we have done in Idaho, I think there is a solution but we\nare going to have to come together to do it. And hopefully,\nthis bill will start the conversation.\nSo thank you so much for the hearing.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator.\nWe really do not want this to be deja vu all over again. It\nhas been three Congresses now and, in the meantime, whether it\nis Yankee, it does not make any difference where you are, we\nhave not been able to address the longer-term issues that must\nbe addressed and folks are looking to us for that legislative\ndirection.\nWe have an obligation to do it. Just because it is hard and\njust because it is politically charged, just because it's\nexpensive--$2.2 million a day that is just, kind of, going out\nthe window--is not helping anybody.\nLet's go to Senator King.\nSenator Risch. You know, Madam Chairman.\nThe Chairman. Go ahead.\nSenator Risch. You hit on a good note about the fact that\nwe have an obligation to do this. It is discouraging to see\nthat the nuclear energy business is going backward, that has\nbeen described by everybody here. Not only in America but all\nover the world people are backing away from nuclear energy and\nplants are closing. Some have reached the end of their life,\nsome that have not. And yet, at the same time, there is this\ntremendous push to try to get carbon out of the air and quit\ndischarging carbon in the air.\nAnd look, solar and wind are great generators, but they\njust do not deliver the load. At some point in time, the carbon\nfuels will run out and nuclear is going to be there. It may not\nbe in this century, but future human beings on the planet are\ngoing to rely, very heavily, on nuclear. It is up to us to come\nup with this, resolving this bottleneck that is causing us so\nmuch problem.\nThank you, Madam Chair.\nThe Chairman. I appreciate that. I think we all agree that\nnuclear should be a strong part of our mix.\nBut just as we are seeing facilities that are being shut\ndown, what that then does to the workforce is it, too,\ndissipates and we lose the leadership that we once had. We once\nused to lead when it came to the manufacturing of nuclear\ncomponents. We basically ceded that in so many different areas.\nWe can't lose the workforce along with that.\nLet's go to Senator King.\nSenator King. Thank you, Madam Chair.\nI experienced and saw a similar thing happen in hydro.\nMajor hydro developments were pretty much done in the '20s and\nwhen we got back into hydro in the '80s a lot of the expertise\nwas gone, a lot of the engineers. There were very few firms\nthat really knew how to do it. A lot of the technology was\nstuck in almost a century old.\nI find this one of the most difficult issues, and I can\nargue it both ways.\nMr. Fettus, you present an appealing plan, state-based----\nMr. Fettus. Thank you.\nSenator King. ----consent-based--yes, I haven't finished\nyet.\n[Laughter.]\nDon't get excited.\nState-based, consent-based, getting rid of the exemptions,\ntreating it like other pollutants.\nHowever, what if every state says no? Which, I think, is\nnot unlikely. I lived through in the '80s an effort to even\ndiscuss a low-level nuclear site in Maine and the outcry was\nunbelievable. What if every state says no, where are we then?\nMr. Fettus. The same place we are now. And we have to try,\njust as Senator Murkowski is, I think, wisely leading this with\na very open mind.\nThe reason why everyone has said no repeatedly, no matter\nwho it is, whether it was then Governor Alexander in Tennessee\nor the fine State of Utah with the PFS site. We actually have a\nconsolidated interim storage facility that's licensed in this\ncountry right now that will never receive a gram of waste and\nthe Committee is well aware of that and it's in Utah.\nSenator Hatch helped put in a wilderness area in order to\nblock it from ever receiving that waste.\nThe problem, and then I really appreciated the talk of the\nCommittee that it's not just about politics. Politics are how\nwe actually----\nSenator King. Politics are an expression of the public\nwill.\nMr. Fettus. Right.\nSenator King. I don't like it when somebody says we are not\ngoing to let politics block these things. That is the public\nspeaking.\nMr. Fettus. I couldn't agree more. And we have to take\naccount of that.\nAnd the way we've done that remarkably in this country with\nall kinds of difficult and controversial issues are through our\nbedrock environmental statutes where we have a strong EPA that\nsets a strong foundational floor of protective standards and\nthen states have delegated programs whether it's air, water,\nsomething else. If you build a widget factory, Senator King's\nwidget factory, and you have a set of methyl-ethyl death that\ngets emitted from your factory. If your--the state can actually\nprotect its citizens, its environment, its waterways, whatever.\nSenator King. Okay, but let me--assume for a moment my\nhypothetical, that we can't find a state that says yes. They\nall say no. Then, as you say, we are back where we are now. We\nhave 80 so-called temporary sites. We have one in Maine costing\nus $10 million a year, costing the ratepayers and the Federal\nGovernment, the ratepayers through the Federal Government, $10\nmillion a year. That is, sort of, the fallback.\nMr. Fettus. Well, can I do my quota, my time?\nSenator King. You don't have a countdown clock in front of\nyou. You can do it if you can do it quickly.\nMr. Fettus. Super-fast.\nSenator King. I am running out of time.\nMr. Fettus. We have a vastly higher chance of actually\nhaving states get to yes if they don't have to take the entire\nburden. It also solves some of the transportation issues. They\ncan do regional. They can do state.\nSenator King. Well, regional is better than one national\nanyway because of transportation.\nMr. Fettus. Correct.\nSenator King. But the transportation routes to Nevada are,\nI have seen them, I mean, Chicago, Kansas City.\nMr. Fettus. Almost every Congressional district.\nAnd but the idea----\nSenator King. And it would be two or three trains a week\nfor years to take care of what we have.\nMr. Fettus. Correct. Yup.\nSenator King. Okay.\nMr. Nesbit. Senator, if I could interject----\nSenator King. Yes?\nMr. Nesbit. ----that part of the problem with consent is\nwho consents?\nIf you look at the current situation in Nevada right now,\nthe people who live closest to the repository have expressed\ntheir political consent for the facility there. But when you\nadd----\nSenator King. I think the lady who sits next to me knows\nmore about what the people of Nevada feel about----\nMr. Nesbit. I understand that, but what I was going to add\nis when you add the additional level of government in between\nat the state level, it becomes very difficult. And no one in\nthe world has solved that conundrum to date.\nSenator King. Well and I understand that. That is why I\nasked my question, what if everyone says no? Because I don't\nthink that is totally unlikely.\nLet me ask a totally different question, a technical\nquestion.\nWhy is it that we are talking about now, forever and\nalways, deep holes, mines? We have these sites around the\ncountry, like in Maine Yankee, that you all have said are safe.\nWhy not use an interim technology instead of we have to solve\nit forever, something that will allow technology to develop\nover the next 20 to 30 years and yet still be safe at a more\ncentralized site? It bothers me that we have 80 sites. I don't\nthink that is very secure.\nMr. Nesbit. I think there's a couple of things there,\nSenator.\nOne is that if you don't have a permanent solution, the\nability to convince a particular location, as we've talked\nabout at this hearing, to accept all this waste----\nSenator King. But if the Maine Yankee site is safe, why not\na larger, similar site that has the same technology you are\ntelling me everybody says is safe, as an interim step until we\nfigure out what the best--I don't understand why we have to go\nfrom 80 temporary to permanent. Isn't there a step in between\nthat is a logical piece?\nMs. Korsnick. Well, that's what consolidated interim\nstorage is.\nSenator King. That is what I am talking about.\nMs. Korsnick. Yeah. And the challenge is nobody wants to\nsign up for consolidated interim storage.\nYou mentioned New Mexico. The governor just recently wrote\na letter. The last New Mexico Governor was in support of\ninterim storage. The current New Mexico governor, not.\nAnd the challenge is because they don't want to become the\nlong-term repository. And until there is an idea of a long-term\nrepository, anybody that raises their hands for their\nconsolidated interim storage is de facto, the long-term----\nSenator King. I think that is a good point because these\ntemporary sites are now the de facto long-term sites.\nMr. Norton. That's correct.\nMr. Fettus. Senator, though, the actual problem we also\nface, and the Obama Administration tried to look at deep\nborehole disposal in South Dakota toward the end of its second\nterm and it turned into an absolute debacle where this is red\nstate South Dakota was objecting.\nAnd it gets precisely to the reasons that we've articulated\ntoday which is that when you're outside of the major functions\nor the normal functioning of environmental law, states have no\ncontrol. So South Dakota erupted, just as New Mexico has, just\nas Nevada has been fighting for 35 years. And when you don't\nfix the institutional framework to allow the process to get to\nyes, we're never going to solve this.\nMr. Nesbit. But I think it's important to recognize that a\nprivate company did conduct a deep drill hole test\nsuccessfully. And I think what that points to is the need to\nget the management of the waste program away from the\nDepartment of Energy and put it into a single purpose.\nSenator King. Which is what you are suggesting.\nMr. Nesbit. Focused organization that is dedicated to\nactual success and we have submitted in our comments, in our\ntestimony, comments along those lines.\nAnd I think it goes----\nSenator King. The bill makes sense, but it bothers me that,\nas I understand it, the bill essentially says this is the way\nwe are going to proceed except Yucca Mountain is still on a\ndifferent track that does not require consent.\nAnyway, Madam Chairman, thank you. This is a very important\nhearing. I appreciate your conducting it.\nThe Chairman. Yes, thank you, Senator King.\nI am going to turn to Senator Manchin, who has to excuse\nhimself from the Committee here.\nSenator Manchin. I do, and I appreciate it so much.\nI just want to have clarification, because something is not\nmaking a lot of sense to me.\nYou are telling me we are not filled up onsite right now so\nwherever the nuclear plants are, they are still able to have\ncapacity to keep that storage there. Is that accurate?\nMr. Nesbit. Senator, we can continue to expand onsite\nstorage as needed.\nSenator Manchin. So we are not at critical mass there?\nI kind of thought we were. I was led to believe that we had\nto do something immediately.\nMr. Fettus. We are in the pools at several sites, Senator.\nSenator Manchin. Okay.\nMr. Fettus. In the spent fuel pools.\nMr. Norton. If I could, Senator, what I'd like to add to\nthat, however, is if you've got sites like mine where the\nreactor is fully decommissioned, all the spent fuel that's ever\ngoing to be generated at that site has been generated at that\nsite. And yet, we sit there loaded, ready to be transported,\nwaiting for some----\nSenator Manchin. I understand. I am going to get to that\nnext, because now you are talking about going to interim sites.\nThat doesn't make any sense to me at all because an interim\nsite has to be transported again to a permanent site.\nMr. Nesbit. Well, Senator, I would like to add and, in my\ntestimony, I pointed this out, I'd like to note the difference\nbetween perceived risk and actual risk. And transportation of\nnuclear material is an area where perceived risk is orders of\nmagnitude greater than the actual risk.\nSenator Manchin. The only thing I am saying is it looks\nlike you are just creating a business model for the interim\nsince we have to get to permanent.\nSo why would you have these paying privately?\nMs. Korsnick. It's really--it's all about timing.\nMr. Nesbit. The advantage of interim is an economy of\nstate.\nMs. Korsnick. It's just a timing issue.\nIf you decided today on a long-term repository site, by the\ntime you license it, let's just select Yucca since we've talked\nabout it, that would still be another three to five years just\nto license it today because all of the analysis has been done.\nAnd there's additional hearings that have to happen. Nevada has\nto have their say.\nSenator Manchin. But if we are not at capacity, why would\nwe have an interim site? If it is going to be three to five\nyears?\nMs. Korsnick. That's just to get your license. It's going\nto be another decade to build it, alright. So you're already\ntalking you have 15 years if you were on go today. Thirty-five\nbillion is what your obligation is today, and in 15 years it's\ngoing to be closer to $50 billion.\nSo you have to manage the liability that you are building\non a daily basis, and the best way to help manage that\nliability is that interim storage because once you start taking\nthat fuel offsite, eventually that judgment fund comes down\nbecause you don't have to pay the judgment fee because you've\ntaken the fuel in an interim state.\nSenator Manchin. How far along are we on permitting the\ninterim sites?\nMs. Korsnick. You're nowhere.\nSenator Manchin. So whether we started today with interim\nor permanent, it is the same timetable.\nMr. Nesbit. There's two sites that have applications in but\nwhether they will actually go forward and construct those sites\nis an open question at this point.\nMr. Fettus. Senator, there are applications but as Senator\nHeinrich just entered into the record, there will be a\nferocious pushback for all the reasons that I've articulated\ntoday. And I couldn't agree more with the lack of wisdom of\npursuing an interim site that's likely to become a de facto\nrepository that doesn't solve what you and Senator Murkowski\nare trying to solve which is the long-term trajectory of how to\nsolve this.\nMr. Nesbit. Senator, the advantage of an interim site is\nthat if you provide security and monitoring at one location\nversus dozens of locations, there are economies of scale\nadvantages for doing that if you're going to do it for a long\nperiod of time.\nMr. Norton. That's correct.\nSenator Manchin. Thank you.\nThe Chairman. Senator Cantwell.\nSenator Cantwell. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thanks for\nhaving this important hearing. I can say for the State of\nWashington, there is probably no more important discussion than\nthe cleanup and disposal of high-level nuclear waste.\nAnd for a state that did what it was asked of us and the\npeople that were there in the development of Hanford, to the\npeople who have done their best at cleanup, we too want to get\nanswers to this.\nI guess, I have been listening to most of the hearing, in\nand out of other things, but I agree with Senator Alexander\nthat moving forward is a very necessary and positive thing. And\nI would say count me in the camp of the belief that consensus-\nbased approaches are more likely to generate quicker results\nthan the legal and long process that we have to continue to\nplay out. And that is even to say if you pass legislation, it\njust does not mean you have cleared the legal hurdles that\ncontinue to stymie us in these debates.\nSo one of the things that Senator Alexander and others have\nreferred to, and some of the witnesses have had the Blue Ribbon\nCommission and, in their discussion, our former colleague, the\nlate Senator Pete Domenici, a member of that.\nOne of the things that I liked about the Commission\nrecommendations was that they thought that separating\ncommercial and defense waste and dealing with that separately\nmight be one of those near-term opportunities to make more\nprogress.\nMr. Fettus or anybody else, do you have a thought on\ncontinuing to look at that as a path forward?\nMr. Fettus. I think that's a secondary issue, Senator,\nbecause I think fixing the----\nSenator Cantwell. Well, it is not secondary to us because\nwe are the ones waiting. I forgot to put the big moniker out\nhere. This is the largest nuclear waste cleanup site in the\nentire world.\nMr. Fettus. Agreed.\nSenator Cantwell. It is complex. It is hard. We are making\nprogress, but we need to get the high-level waste out.\nSo let's come up with a process of moving the defense waste\nout. The complexity of Senator Feinstein's concerns on the\ncommercial side are going to take us a long time to figure out.\nJust like Hanford is cleaning up some easy to clean up\nthings and getting to the harder things, why can't we move\nforward on defense?\nMr. Fettus. I think the challenge with the defense waste\ngetting to a repository is going to be the same as the\nchallenge with commercial spent nuclear fuel--that if you don't\nhave the statutory and regulatory process that can allow\nconsent in getting to yes, you won't solve it.\nThat's why I meant it a second ago----\nSenator Cantwell. I am saying, we are saying the same\nthing.\nMr. Fettus. Yup.\nSenator Cantwell. I want a consent process that is faster.\nIf they will take that, I am just saying, streamline defense so\nit can get done faster as you deal with all the other aspects.\nMr. Fettus. If you can get all the waste out of the tanks\nand get it vitrified and get it ready, that would be great.\nSenator Cantwell. Well, this is, believe me, a day-to-day\ntask----\nMr. Fettus. Yes.\nSenator Cantwell. ----for us in the State of Washington,\nbut we are only doing it on behalf of the entire United States\nand part of stewardship. This should be every member of this\nCommittee's responsibility. This is a responsibility of the\nUnited States of America, not just the State of Washington or\nenvironmental director.\nBut I will tell you as we fight every time on some idea\nthat is shortchanging the cleanup process or an idea, we are\ndesperate to move the defense waste in a way in which people\nare saying to us, we want it and we will take it and we want to\nexplore those ideas and see if we cannot move forward.\nSo thank you, Madam Chair.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator Cantwell.\nSenator Barrasso.\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you very much, Madam Chairman. It\nis good to be here. I want to thank you and Ranking Member\nManchin for holding this important hearing this morning.\nThis Congress, this Committee has discussed exciting and\ninnovative ways to address climate change. We have explored\ncarbon capture technologies, renewable resources and advanced\nnuclear power and nuclear energy.\nIn several of the hearings, witnesses have stressed that\nnuclear energy is an essential part of our clean energy\nportfolio. If we are serious about addressing climate change,\nwe must be serious about preserving and expanding the use of\nnuclear energy. We cannot do it without nuclear energy. So the\nlack of a nuclear waste management program limits the use and\nthe expansion of nuclear power.\nIn May, I chaired an Environment and Public Works Committee\nhearing on my discussion draft legislation that would\ncomplement and could complement Senator Murkowski and Senator\nAlexander's nuclear waste legislation.\nEight states right now have new bans, bans on new nuclear\nuntil Washington permanently disposes of nuclear waste.\nCommunities across the country are struggling to accept new\nnuclear plants because there is no permanent pathway to remove\nthe nuclear waste.\nI am glad this Committee is holding this hearing to address\nthese challenges.\nMs. Korsnick and Mr. Nesbit, American ratepayers have now\npaid about $15 billion to site, to study and to design a\nrepository for the Yucca Mountain site. And of this funding,\n$200 million was paid to the State of Nevada to develop their\nown scientific and technical analysis.\nMs. Korsnick, why is it important for the Nuclear\nRegulatory Commission to complete the independent safety review\nof the proposed Yucca Mountain repository?\nMs. Korsnick. Well, you just mentioned the significant\nmoney that has been expended. We should have a fair hearing\nand, quite frankly, give Nevada a chance to have their hearing.\nThe process will require that it goes through the judges,\net cetera, through the licensing process and for all this money\nthat has been expended, let's understand the science and the\nlicensing process and work ourself through it.\nIn the future, we might need another long-term repository,\nso let's learn everything that we can and understand the\nscience and the licensing process for the one that's so far\nalong.\nSenator Barrasso. Following up on that, Mr. Nesbit, why is\nit important----\nMr. Nesbit. I knew what you meant.\nSenator Barrasso. Okay.\nYou note that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Yucca\nMountain licensing review is valuable. And it is valuable to\ninform safety regulations for a different repository site.\nIs it also important to complete the pending licensing\nprocess to build that public trust?\nMr. Nesbit. Absolutely. I agree with everything that Ms.\nKorsnick said.\nThere's other reasons why it is beneficial for the American\npeople to go forward and complete the licensing even if Yucca\nMountain isn't built. I mean, we don't know what the answer is\nuntil we do it. I mean, if something is found that said this is\nnot the right place to do it, we've got to go find another\nsolution. But we need to go through the process in order to\ndemonstrate the ability to license a geologic repository for\nused fuel and high-level radioactive waste here in the United\nStates. We're going to learn a great number of lessons from\nthat. And having invested $15 billion already, I think it only\nmakes sense to get a little more return for that huge\ninvestment.\nAnd the only other thing I'll say along those lines is it\nis the law that we do that. I think that if we demonstrate that\nwe're going to follow the law here, if we change the law and do\nsomething different later, then people will believe that we'll\nfollow the law there too.\nSenator Barrasso. Okay.\nAlong those lines, back to you, Ms. Korsnick.\nLike Senator Murkowski's bill, my Nuclear Waste Discussion\nDraft allows the Secretary of Energy to partner with private\ncompanies to store spent nuclear fuel on an interim basis. Mr.\nNesbit just talked about other sites. The draft requires the\ninterim storage program to proceed at the same time as the\nNuclear Regulatory Commission's review of the Yucca Mountain\nlicense application.\nDo you support a requirement that interim storage is\nconnected to tangible action on a permanent repository for\nnuclear waste?\nMs. Korsnick. Yes, in fact, we think it enables that\ninterim storage because people will see, alright, you have this\npath for a long-term answer. I'm happy to participate in your\nshorter-term answer because I understand that this pathway\nexists.\nSenator Barrasso. Finally to Dr. Wagner, if I could.\nThe Idaho National Lab is a leader, a real leader, in\ndeveloping advanced nuclear technologies. It is also the\nproposed site of the nation's first small modular reactor which\nis going to provide nuclear power to the intermountain West.\nAdvanced nuclear reactors can increase safety, I believe,\ncan decrease cost, can reduce the amount of nuclear waste. So\nwhile advanced nuclear can reduce nuclear waste, will there\nstill be nuclear waste products that must be permanently\ndisposed of?\nDr. Wagner. Yeah, the short answer is yes.\nThere's a variety of advanced reactor concepts that can\nsignificantly increase fuel utilization. There's also different\nconcepts that Maria spoke about earlier that close the nuclear\nfuel cycle through reprocessing. But at the end of the day\nthere are always going to be some small amount of material that\nrequires deep geological repository.\nSenator Barrasso. Yes, thank you. Thank you, Madam\nChairman.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator.\nI was going to ask a question about what is the number? How\nmany additional storage facilities, long-term repositories, do\nwe need?\nAs I am thinking about that, it is like, well, we don't\nknow because of exactly what you have said, Dr. Wagner, moving\nforward. What will the future of nuclear bring to us in terms\nof advanced nuclear and the prospect for less waste?\nWe have talked about reprocessing. I think we know what we\nknow today, but the innovation, that is out there is still\nevolving, if you will. The view into the deep boreholes. We may\nbe looking at Yucca as okay, this is the design for what we\nneeded 20 years ago but is it the design that we need going\nforward? And so, I think we need to factor that into the\ncalculus.\nThe question for those of you who have looked at the\nlegislation that we have laid down here as our working\ndocument, do you think we do enough in this proposed\nlegislation to be specific about the type of research and\ndevelopment that DOE or the Administration needs to move\nforward on? Do we need to do more in that we have been talking\nso much about this whole consent-based process and the interim\nand moving to permanent, but we have not really talked about\nsome of the context of this bill that can move the industry\nforward. Do we have enough in there? Do we need to do more?\nMr. Norton?\nMr. Norton. Yes, Senator, if I could.\nMadam Chairman, a couple things I wanted to reflect on in\nyour question, and I had this conversation with Maria's\npredecessor, Marv Fertel, probably six or seven years ago when\nmy sites and the other decommissioning plant coalition sites,\nat the time there were five of us, were kind of the poster\nchildren of this problem, right?\nThe Chairman. Right.\nMr. Norton. We operated the plant. We've decommissioned the\nplant. We're waiting.\nI told him at that point in time there was less focus on it\nboth at NEI and the industry than there is today, but I did\ntell him on the path we're at then and potentially the path\nwe're on now, more than 50 percent of our nuclear fleet will be\nin the same condition I'm in before we solve this problem if we\nkeep trying the same thing we've been trying for the last 20\nyears. And I don't think he believed me. But if he was watching\nit today, with the number of plants that have either shut down\nor announced shut down, my estimate is not going to be far off,\neven if we get moving from here.\nAnd so, it is a clear problem. It is a clear issue. I think\nSenate bill 1234, although we have comments that would make\nrecommendations on changes, is a good starting point for us to\nwork together to figure out how to resolve this problem because\nwhat we have been doing for the last 20 years is not going to\nwork.\nI would also like to acknowledge my Senator from Maine,\nSenator King, and his question about are we really thinking\nabout this the right way? And I think that needs to be asked.\nI know there's scientists and others that may have a\ndifference of opinion here, but I do think we have to challenge\nourselves as to did we really plot the right course with our\noriginal plan for a repository and is there an alternative way\nto think about this? By consolidating this waste, looking at\neither reprocessing or other technical advancements, other\noptions that other countries are looking at and take the\nblinders off and look at this more holistically.\nThe Chairman. I appreciate that.\nMr. Nesbit.\nMr. Nesbit. Senator, I'd just like to add a couple of\nthings.\nOne is American Nuclear Society does support continued\nresearch into advanced nuclear energy systems and advanced\nwaste management techniques. There's actually private companies\nout there that are working in this area as well.\nI think the question of where that needs to reside, whether\nit's in your bill or in other legislation is a good question. I\nthink the work that John Wagner and others are doing at Idaho\nis, they are looking at advanced energy systems in a holistic\nmanner that includes the waste management issue, and I think\nthey need to continue that work.\nThe Chairman. Got it.\nMr. Fettus.\nMr. Fettus. And Senator, the Blue Ribbon Commission wisely\ncautioned against trusting in reprocessing as any meaningful\nsolution for nuclear waste and the offramp, it's past time for\nthe offramp on recycling of spent fuel in this country. It's\nboth dangerous proliferation and security concerns. It creates\nmore waste and it will not solve the waste problem, and no\ncountry has used it to solve their waste problem. And most of\nall, it's not economical and the BRC identified that it likely\nnever will be.\nThe Chairman. Dr. Wagner, you want to respond to that?\nDr. Wagner. Well, I would just comment that, you know, we\ndon't currently recycle because it's not economical.\nYou know, one of the many benefits talked about with\nrespect to consolidated interim storage is that whether in time\nit becomes economical with a substantial growth in nuclear\nenergy or other technologies for waste disposal and design of\nrepositories come into play. A consolidated interim storage\nfacility allows you to make progress to move forward on this\nissue while some of those other things may or may not come to\nbe other options for the material.\nThe Chairman. I appreciate that.\nWe have just had a vote start. I would like to allow my\ncolleagues an opportunity for a last word, if they would like.\nSenator Cortez Masto.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Actually, I do, thank you, Madam\nChair.\nMr. Nesbit, I sat here and listened to you. Thank you for\nbeing here. The arguments you make are the same arguments I\nhave heard for the last 30 years from the industry. But you\nmake one argument that talks about Yucca Mountain being\nutilized to learn from the science and that is why it should\nmove forward. I think we should learn from the science from\nYucca Mountain because there are no natural barriers or man-\nmade barriers that make it safe. But we keep hearing that all\nthe time.\nSo let me ask you this, if we were to learn from the\nscience of Yucca Mountain which would require still 40 more\nmiles of tunnel to be, to dig the tunnel to bury the canisters,\nwhich by the way, the same canisters that are utilized for\nYucca Mountain in the study can't be utilized because the\nindustry does not use the same type of canisters. But what I am\ntold it is so hot once it is stored and it leaks like a sieve\nbecause the hydrology shows already in exploratory tunnel, it\nleaks like a sieve. That once the canisters are there, titanium\ndrip shields will have to be created to put over the canisters.\nAnd by the way, those titanium drip shields would not be placed\nin that facility once the canisters are here until 90 years\nlater and it cannot be placed by a man in there, so you have to\nbuild robotics to put the titanium drip shields to protect the\nwater that goes down into the canisters that would go into the\naquifer below. Is that the science you are saying that you\nwould learn from that you should not have in any other\nrepository?\nMr. Nesbit. What I was referring to, Senator, was\ncompleting the licensing process and having the concerns, such\nas you just expressed, evaluated by a panel of experts and\nruled on in a manner that we can learn from them, if indeed we\ngo on to develop other repositories elsewhere. That's all I'm\ntalking about.\nSenator Cortez Masto. We already have the information, and\nthat is my point.\nMr. Nesbit. Well, Senator, I don't agree with your\nconcerns.\nSenator Cortez Masto. We have spent $19 billion on a five-\nmile exploratory tunnel to study the geology and hydrology. We\nknow that because it is a volcanic tuff and there are fractures\nthrough the rock that it's going to leak. So that is why the\ntitanium drip shields are part of your plan for the canisters\nthat will be placed there.\nThat is what I am saying. We already have the information\nthat shows it is not safe. Why are we going to waste another 30\nyears with 218 contentions by the state and lawsuits that I\nknow I was part of as Attorney General, against your\ndepartment, or excuse me, against the Department of Energy,\ninstead of looking forward in a comprehensive approach and\nutilizing the science to help us understand in moving forward\non the new technology that is out there. That is all I am\nlooking for, and I would love for the industry to come to the\ntable and work with us on that.\nThank you.\nMr. Nesbit. The key question at Yucca Mountain is not\nwhether it's built in volcanic tuff, but whether it can or\ncannot comply with the very conservative environmental\nstandards that were laid down to protect the health and safety\nof the public. And that's the question that would be resolved\nin a licensing hearing before fair, impartial and qualified\njudges.\nSenator Cortez Masto. I disagree.\nBut now that I have more time, let me add a little bit more\nto this because I think for purposes of science, we really are,\nand I would ask the scientists here, isn't the intent here to\ndecrease any type of unexpected opportunities with respect to\nscience?\nYou want a place that is safe, that you are going to\ndecrease any vulnerabilities with respect to that deep geologic\nsite instead of adding to those vulnerabilities by man-made,\nalleged safety barriers or natural safety barriers. You are\ngoing to decrease those kind of vulnerabilities. And isn't that\nwhat you're really looking for, for any type of site, a deep\ngeologic site?\nAnd maybe, Mr. Fettus, I don't know if you have a response\nto that?\nMr. Fettus. I couldn't agree more, Senator Cortez Masto.\nThe idea behind any geologic repository is to find geologic\nmedia that can isolate the waste for the length of time it's\ndangerous. And the problem that the Yucca Mountain project has\nrepeatedly run into is whenever it ran into the technical\nchallenges that you so accurately describe, the response was to\nweaken the standards to allow the site to be licensed. So we\ndon't look at that upcoming atomic safety and licensing board\nproceeding, if it were to ever go forward, as a full exercise\nin having the state have a fair say.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you.\nMs. Korsnick. If I could just add, since we were talking\nabout drip shields, we do know that EPRI did an analysis back\nin 2008 and they found that the repository was capable of\nmeeting the regulatory requirements without the drip shields,\nthat they had sufficient defense in depth. The drip shields\nwere designed simply as an additional redundant layer of\nprotection. I just wanted to make sure that that was clear.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Right, but still the drip shields are\nthere as a redundant layer and that is the point. And you are\nsupposed to be reducing those types of additional redundancies,\naren't you, as supposedly having the natural redundancies there\nand then adding them as necessary.\nAgain, I am all for moving forward. I think we have to have\na solution here, and I think we have to be smart about it.\nThis is waste that is going to be there for millions of\nyears, for generations to come for our children and our\ngrandchildren, and we have to do right by them. We have to be\ncoming together, particularly in this country, to address this\nissue.\nThank you, Madam Chair.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator.\nAnd to our panel, we appreciate your contribution this\nmorning. We all acknowledge that we have an issue that has been\na longstanding issue that has not been resolved and our effort\nwill be to defy the skeptics and to change the status quo\nwhich, quite honestly, has been going on for far too long.\nI do not want Senator Risch to be sitting here in this\nCommittee five years from now in a similar hearing and saying,\nI remember back in 2019 we were talking about it and it was the\nsame as it was when I first came to the Committee.\nWe have an obligation. We have good folks working on\nthings. So let's try to address this very longstanding problem.\nWith that, the Committee stands adjourned.\n[Whereupon, at 11:55 a.m. the hearing was adjourned.]\nAPPENDIX MATERIAL SUBMITTED\n----------\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\n[all]",

Michael Crapo, Chairman of the\nCommittee, presiding.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN MIKE CRAPO\nChairman Crapo. The hearing will come to order.\nToday we are joined by three witnesses who have evaluated\nand written extensively on the Terrorism Risk Insurance\nProgram, including Mr. Tarique Nageer, Terrorism Placement and\nAdvisory Leader with Marsh; Dr. Howard Kunreuther, the Co-\nDirector of the Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes\nCenter; and Mr. Baird Webel, Specialist in Financial Economics\nwith the Congressional Research Service.\nThe terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, devastated\nU.S. citizens, households, and businesses. In the wake of those\nattacks, Congress passed and the President signed into law the\nTerrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 to establish the Terrorism\nRisk Insurance Program, or TRIP, and to stabilize the market\nfor terrorism risk insurance.\nSince then, Congress has reauthorized the program three\ndifferent times in 2005, 2007, and 2015.\nMy goal in each reauthorization was to build on existing\ndata to find ways for the private insurance industry to absorb\nand cover the losses for all but the largest acts of terror,\nones in which the Federal Government would likely be forced to\nstep in were the program not there.\nCongress made several improvements to the program during\nthe 2015 reauthorization. First, it increased the program\ntrigger from $100 million to $200 million in increments of $20\nmillion each year. Second, it increased aggregate retention\namount of $2 billion each year eventually to an amount that\nwill be based on average insurer deductibles; and third, it\ndecreased the coinsurance rate from 85 percent to 80 percent in\n1 percent increments each year.\nThat bill garnered overwhelming bipartisan support in the\nSenate with a vote of 93 to 4.\nThe Program is once again set to expire on December 31,\n2020. Well ahead of that expiration date, the Banking Committee\nhas already started meeting with key stakeholders and is\nexploring whether there are additional balanced reforms to\nimprove the program and reduce taxpayer exposure without having\na material negative effect on the cost and take-up rates for\nterrorism coverage.\nIn 2018, the Treasury Department issued a report on the\nprogram's effectiveness, which also discussed key developments\nin the marketplace for terrorism risk insurance.\nIn addition to Treasury concluding in the report that the\nprogram has accomplished its principle goals identified in\nTRIA, Treasury also observed that private reinsurance of\nterrorism risk has significantly increased under the program,\nand there is now increased private reinsurance capacity for the\nexposures that remain wholly with the private market under\nTRIP.\nEach of today's witnesses have written extensively on the\nprogram's effectiveness, structure, and market developments.\nIn 2018, Dr. Kunreuther coauthored a report on the program,\nwhich found that, overall, TRIA has worked well. It has\nstabilized a very disrupted market in the aftermath of 2001,\nmaking terrorism insurance widely available and affordable.\nTake-up rates among enterprises, small and large, are rather\nhigh, and premiums, a few percentage points of what firms pay\nfor their property insurance, even though cost and take-up\nrates vary widely by size, industry, geography, and line of\nbusiness.\nIn its 2019 Terrorism Risk Insurance Report, Marsh\ndiscussed take-up rates as well as cost, geographic, and\ncorporate trends in terrorism risk insurance in the United\nStates as well as globally.\nMarsh emphasized in the report that the Federal backstop\ncreated by TRIA and reauthorized as TRIPRA, along with similar\npublic-private mechanisms that exist in other countries,\nremains crucial to the continued stability and health of the\nproperty terrorism insurance market.\nFinally, the Congressional Research Service has published\nnumerous reports, including one as recently as April 2019,\nproviding a comprehensive overview of the program, its history,\nstatutory changes in past reauthorizations, and key\nconsiderations for this Congress.\nDuring this hearing, I look forward to hearing more about\nspecific considerations in evaluating the program's\neffectiveness, how the program has evolved over time, how the\nmarketplace has responded to changes to the program made by\nCongress in previous reauthorizations, what additional room\nexists to further reduce taxpayer exposure, and how market\nparticipants may react to changes in different program levers.\nAgain, I thank each of the witnesses for joining us today\nto share your perspectives and your research.\nSenator Brown.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR SHERROD BROWN\nSenator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding the\nCommittee's first hearing on the reauthorization of the\nTerrorism Risk Insurance Program. It expires the end of next\nyear, after the lapse at the end of 2014. We all understand we\nneed to start early enough to make sure it does not happen\nagain.\nTRIA is critical to keeping our economy healthy. It is not\njust a program that helps in the event of a terrorist attack.\nBusinesses rely on this insurance in order to get access to\ncredit, even in healthy economic times. Without Government\nassistance, the insurance market would be unable to provide\naffordable insurance to these businesses, including small\nbusinesses, across our country.\nWhile TRIA was initially designed to be temporary after 9/\n11, both parties have agreed several times since then that\nthere is value in keeping it. People may hear the word\n``terrorism'' and think this does not apply to their community,\nthat only businesses in places like New York and Washington or\nbig national landmarks would need to worry about insuring\nagainst terrorism.\nBut, unfortunately, terrorism is not confined to big\ncities, and the groups perpetrating it do not only come from\nabroad. Ohio communities that have faced threats from white\nsupremacist groups know all too well this is a risk we all\ncontend with.\nThat is why I am glad we have been able to work on it in a\nbipartisan way. We agree there are some issues that the free\nmarket just cannot solve on its own. This is one of them. It is\nan example of the kind of successful Government intervention\nthat is only possible when we come together as a country.\nSome in Congress would prefer the United States not make\nthese kind of guarantees, whether it is for worker pensions,\nwhether it is for Social Security, whether it is for mortgages\nand affordable housing or for health care or food for low-\nincome families, or this issue for protections against economic\ndestruction after terrorist attacks. Some politicians just are\nnot interested in coming together on behalf of Americans that\nlive in Mansfield or Cleveland or Boise or Idaho Falls.\nI disagree and think the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program\nis emblematic of our ability to use Government to make the\neconomy work better for everybody, especially during difficult\ntimes. As we look at other issues on this Committee, I hope we\nwill remember the success of this program and our capacity to\nuse Government to solve tough problems when we decide that is\nwhat we want to do.\nIn the last bipartisan authorization of TRIA, we worked to\nstrike a balance, which seems to work well. By increasing the\nprogram trigger to $200 million, by gradually reducing the\nGovernment's share in the losses, we have made the program\nefficient without decreasing access to coverage. We have an\nopportunity to make the program even stronger by creating\ncertainty in the marketplace through a long-term extension of\nthe program, and I emphasize long term. I hope we can work\ntogether to do that.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you, Senator Brown.\nWe will now proceed to our witnesses, and I will ask you to\nplease give your oral remarks in the order I introduced you and\nagain ask you to remember to watch that clock so that we can\nstay to your 5 minutes allocated and get to the Senators'\nquestions.\nWith that, Mr. Nageer.\nSTATEMENT OF TARIQUE NAGEER, TERRORISM PLACEMENT AND ADVISORY\nLEADER, MARSH\nMr. Nageer. Good morning, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member\nBrown, and Members of the Committee. My name is Tarique Nageer,\nand I am the Terrorism Placement Leader at Marsh. I do\nappreciate the opportunity to speak with you today about this\ntopic.\nFor our company, like many others, the impact of terrorism\nis deeply personal. Marsh & McLennan lost 295 colleagues and\nscores of business associates on 9/11.\nAs a leading risk advisor in the insurance market, Marsh &\nMcLennan has a unique perspective on the Terrorism Risk\nInsurance Program.\nTerrorism remains an evolving, expanding, and ever present\nrisk, which underlies the importance of this program and\nensuring the continued stability and health of the property and\ncasualty terrorism insurance market.\nWe have seen a decline in both the frequency and severity\nof terrorist incidents in the United States over the last\nseveral years, and there have been no certified terrorism\nlosses in the United States since TRIA was originally passed in\n2002, but we cannot afford to be complacent. The Federal\nbackstop created by TRIA restored insurance capacity during the\ncritical post-9/11 period.\nWe at Marsh strongly support its reauthorization and\nmodernization, including enhancing the existing public-private\npartnership.\nToday my testimony will include four main areas. First,\nfindings from the Marsh's 2019 Terrorism Risk Ins Report once\nagain highlighted that terrorism risk is not only a big-\nbusiness or big-city issue. Education entities with the most\nfrequent buyers of terrorism insurance in 2018, while companies\nin hospitality, gaming, health care, life sciences, and\nnonprofits all landed in the top 10 of buyers. These\norganizations can be found anywhere, from small college towns\nto urban city centers.\nThe uptake for TRIA coverage and property policies averaged\n62 percent in 2018. Clearly, a wide array of industries depend\non the program to thrive and protect their workforce as they\ncontinue to purchase terrorism coverage at a high rate.\nSecond, I would like to provide an overview of the current\nstate of the terrorism insurance market. While there have been\nno significant insured losses in recent years and the industry\nis well capitalized, the access to terrorism insurance is still\ndependent on insurer's preference, appetite, and aggregate\nconstraints. There is a strong possibility that if the Federal\nbackstop ceases to exist, we could see a dominant effect of\nincreased pricing across multiple insurance lines, not just\nterrorism, with a likely result of a major marketplace\ndisruption.\nThird, I will speak about how TRIA plays an integral role\nin the availability and affordability of workers' compensation\ninsurance. The impact of TRIA on the workers' compensation\nmarket makes clear that as long as the Federal backstop remains\nin place, there should be adequate capacity for workers'\ncompensation terrorism coverage. Because of its State-regulated\nnature, workers' compensation policies cannot limit or exclude\ncoverage for perils such as terrorism or nuclear, biological,\nchemical, or radiological, commonly known as NBCR.\nNBCR events can lead to very large human life and economic\nlosses, but coverage is not typically included in reinsurance\ncontracts.\nIn 2014, the uncertainty around TRIA led some insurers to\nstep back from insuring industries with high employee\nconcentrations in certain cities. As insurers began to review\npolicies extending beyond 2020, their willingness to insure\nrisks in high-profile areas will likely decrease again, thus,\nleaving large populations of employees vulnerable.\nFinally, we are already seeing an impact on policies that\nextend beyond 2020, with some insurers either seemingly\nunwilling to offer terrorism coverage beyond the expiration of\nTRIPRA or increase in prices to cover the additional risks to\ntheir portfolios.\nWithout a decision to reauthorize or extend, we expect to\nsee sunset provisions on policies and higher costs as we move\ncloser to December 31, 2020.\nIn Marsh's view, this legislation is a model public-private\npartnership that is instrumental in maintaining a vibrant\nmarketplace by allowing insurers to provide adequate limits of\nterrorism insurance to the business community at affordable\nprices. A seamless\nrenewal process with a robust reauthorization will keep the\nmarketplace sustainable.\nWe encourage decisions to be made with a full understanding\nof the shifts and the nature of terrorism and how they can\naffect organizations and insureds alike.\nFinally, thank you again to the Committee for holding this\nhearing 18 months in advance of the program's scheduled\nexpiration. Time is of the essence, and I look forward to your\nquestions.\nThank you.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you.\nDr. Kunreuther.\nSTATEMENT OF HOWARD KUNREUTHER, Ph.D., PROFESSOR OF DECISION\nSCIENCES AND PUBLIC POLICY AND\nCO-DIRECTOR OF THE WHARTON RISK MANAGEMENT AND DECISION\nPROCESSES CENTER, THE WHARTON SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF\nPENNSYLVANIA\nMr. Kunreuther. Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and\nMembers of the Committee, I very much appreciate the\nopportunity of testifying on the reauthorization of the\nTerrorism Risk Insurance Program. My name is Howard Kunreuther.\nI am the James G. Dinan Professor of Decision Sciences and\nPublic Policy at the Wharton School, University of\nPennsylvania, and Co-Director of the Wharton Risk Management\nand Decision Processes Center.\nThe Center was founded in 1985, with a mission to examine\nalternative strategies for dealing with low-probability, high-\nconsequence events, based on an understanding of the decision\nprocesses of individuals, firms, and public-sector agencies.\nAs Chairman Crapo pointed out, we have produced several\nstudies on the 2015 renewal of TRIA undertaken in consultation\nwith key interested parties from the public and private sectors\nand other academic research institutions that are cited in my\nwritten testimony.\nGiven the limited time that I have available and the\ncomments that Chairman Crapo has made and Representative Brown\nas well as my colleague here, Mr. Nageer, I want to focus on\nreally a following question that was alluded to by Chairman\nCrapo: What modifications to the current public-private\npartnerships should be considered in the renewal of TRIA?\nIn developing these proposals, it is useful, in our\nopinion--and I will speak for a number of us at the Wharton\nRisk Center--to focus on the individual decision processes and\nour systematic biases that have been well documented by\npsychologists and behavioral economists, are discussed in our\nbook ``The Ostrich Paradox: Why We Underprepare for\nDisasters,'' written with my Co-Director, Robert Meyer.\nLet me highlight five of these biases and indicate where\nthey could be used and addressed with respect to the renewal of\nTRIA: first, myopia, the tendency to focus on short-time\nhorizons when appraising immediate costs and the potential\nbenefits of protective investments; amnesia, the tendency to\nforget too quickly the lessons of past disasters; optimism, the\ntendency to underestimate the likelihood that losses will occur\nfrom future hazards; simplification, the tendency to\nselectively attend to only a subset of relevant facts when\nmaking choices involving risk; and finally, herding, the\ntendency to base our choices on the observed actions of others\nwho may not know a great deal more than we know ourselves in\ndealing with these low-probability events.\nI will focus on four areas very briefly in the remaining\ntime to highlight how they may play a role.\nFirst, incentivizing cost-effective mitigation measures by\nfirms, something that TRIA does not do today. To overcome the\nmyopia bias, one could consider long-term mitigation loans, the\nway FEMA has done with respect to the flood problem, and at the\nsame time have insurers offer premium discounts if the claims\nare going to be lower by firms investing in these mitigation\nmeasures.\nSecond, Federal protection against catastrophic losses.\nNow, in our view, in my view, it is important that the Federal\nGovernment cover NBCR, losses from future terrorist attacks,\ngiven the potential catastrophic losses and recoup their\nexpenditures under TRIA. Currently, it is ambiguous as to\nexactly what will happen, although they have the intent to do\nthat.\nNow, the point I want to make here is Congress and the\nstakeholders should not exhibit an optimism bias or an amnesia\nbias by feeling it will not happen to the United States because\nit has not occurred to day.\nThird, behavior of insurers and Congress after a terrorist\nattack. Will premiums significantly increase and future\ncoverage decrease by insurers who might exhibit the\nsimplification bias and focus on worst-case scenarios rather\nthan thinking about likelihood as well? What will Congress do\nif insurers significantly raise their premium so that many\ncommercial firms feel they cannot afford to purchase insurance\nprotection?\nOn that basis, there is a suggestion that insurers consider\na multi-year policy, a 2- or 3-year policy, so they keep this\nfor more than just the 1 year and for that reason actually are\nin a position to deal with this afterwards.\nFinally, dealing with interdependencies. There are a lot of\nevents, like cyber, that are interdependent and have, can cause\npotentially catastrophic losses. Treasury and the private\ninsurers should integrate and interact with each other on that\nissue.\nSo, in conclusion, Congress and other key stakeholders\nshould examine how countries cope with terrorism risk to\ndetermine whether these approaches merit consideration for the\nUnited States.\nAnd on that note, let me conclude my comments here and look\nforward to a dialogue with you afterwards.\nThank you.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you.\nMr. Webel.\nSTATEMENT OF BAIRD WEBEL, SPECIALIST IN FINANCIAL ECONOMICS,\nCONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE\nMr. Webel. Thank you.\nMr. Chairman, Ranking Member, Members of the Committee,\nthank you for the opportunity to testify today. My name is\nBaird Webel. I am a Specialist in Financial Economics at the\nCongressional Research Service.\nAs a note for members of the audience who may not be\nfamiliar with the CRS, we are a division of the Library of\nCongress. Our role is to provide objective, nonpartisan\nresearch and analysis. CRS takes no position on the\ndesirability of any specific policy nor advocates for any\nspecific policy outcome.\nI have been at CRS at this role since 2003, so I have seen\nthe reauthorizations of TRIA since, and I would like to talk\nabout three broad things that Congress has faced as we have\ndone reauthorization in the past.\nThe first question that it faced is, basically, is a\nFederal terrorism program needed? TRIA was passed a little more\nthan a year after the terrorist attacks in September 11, 2001.\nIt was passed as a specifically temporary 3-year program, and\nby temporary, I do not mean that there was an expiration date,\njust an expiration date of 2005. The statute itself in two\nplaces says this is a temporary program.\nAs the end of previous reauthorizations have come up,\nCongress has successively seen the need to reauthorize the\nprogram to give the private market additional time to face the\nthreat of terrorism losses, and I think a significant point in\nthis is the difficulty in estimating terrorist events going\nforward and the losses from these events. The industry has been\nlargely successful at rebuilding capital, but making estimates\nof future terrorism losses remains exceedingly difficult.\nWhat Congress has done in the TRIA reauthorizations is\nbasically affect the second aspect that I would talk about,\nnamely how private insurers should share in funding terrorism\nrisk with the Federal Government.\nThere are basically three different levers in the program\nthat have been used in this sense. There is a deductible, and\nessentially, it is a two-stage deductible.\nThere is a program trigger, which is an aggregate amount of\nlosses that the entire industry will incur before Federal\nfunding occurs.\nThere is an individual insurer deductible which is set\nessentially based on the written premium for each insurer, a\nrough proximate size of its exposure to the terrorism market\nthat must be cleared before Federal funding occurs.\nAnd then after this, after these deductibles, there is an\ninsured loss share compensation, and this is essentially a\ncopay. So that once you clear the deductibles, there is a\nvarying amount--there has been a varying amount of the share\nthat the Government will cover.\nFinally, there are terrorism loss spreading premiums. These\nare somewhat unusual in the insurance world in the sense that\nwhen we all purchase homeowners insurance or auto insurance, we\npay our premiums upfront. In this case, the premiums are set to\nbe after the fact, and so that depending on the exact loss\nlevels, there will be a premium placed on insurance policies\ngoing forward to recoup the amount for the Government.\nAll of these over the life of TRIA have been adjusted in\nvarious ways to increase the private-sector exposure to\nterrorism risk.\nAnd the third broad aspect that I would talk about is, What\nexactly should a Federal terrorism insurance program cover?\nRight now, TRIA basically works through the private\ninsurance market. Private insurance policies that are covered\nunder the lines that are specified in TRIA--the private\ninsurers are required to make terrorism coverage available\nunder essentially the same terms and conditions for other types\nof insurance. So if you are going to cover loss from a fire,\nfor example, from an accident, the insurer has to offer\ncoverage for a fire due to loss from terrorism, but the\ninsureds are not required to purchase this policy.\nAnd the terms and conditions that apply to this are the\nsame--it is the same for an accidental cause as it is for a\nterrorist cause, and this becomes particularly important in the\nrealm of nuclear, chemical, biological, radiological, because\nmost private insurance policies will exclude NCBR events,\nregardless of the source. So if a policy excludes a chemical\nspill from an accident from a train, it will exclude a chemical\nspill caused by a terrorist attack, and I think this is\nparticularly significant because those are the terrorist\nattacks that could cause the most damage. And I am not certain\nthat people realize to what degree these NCBR events would not\nbe covered.\nSo, with the end of the 5 minutes, I will be happy to take\nany future questions.\nThank you.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you, Mr. Webel, and I appreciate each\nof you. You all stayed within your 5 minutes. I appreciate\nthat.\nMr. Webel, I will start with you. It is very important to\nme that the two major objectives will be achieved. One is that\nTRIA continually benefit and stabilize the marketplace, and the\nother is that we minimize taxpayer exposure.\nWhat factors do you look at to indicate whether TRIA has\nbeen effective and to measure its potential future success in\nachieving these objectives?\nMr. Webel. I think that the take-up rate for terrorism\npolicies is really important because you can see, for example,\nin the flood insurance program that you get flood disasters\nwhere a lot of people have not purchased flood insurance\npolicies. And it is not going to help to have an insurance-\nproviding program if you do not have the people purchasing the\npolicies.\nI think as well, any aspects that you can have of overall\nprivate reinsurance capacity, the amount of private insurance\nthat it offered outside of TRIA is a really important marker of\nhow well the private market is responding and developing\ncapacity to deal with terrorism.\nChairman Crapo. All right. Thank you.\nI am going to move to you--is it ``Nageer'' or ``Nagger''?\nMr. Nageer. Nageer.\nChairman Crapo. OK. Nageer.\nIn terms of the objective of assuring that we achieve the\nbest possible protection of hitting a taxpayer bailout or a\ntaxpayer cost here, we need to understand how changes that we\nmake to the program can have an impact on both small and large\nparticipants, some insurers themselves.\nSo I guess the question I am asking is, Can you provide an\nindication of how smaller and larger insurers may be affected\nby changes in the coinsurance rate and the program trigger,\nrespectively, based on our historical evidence?\nMr. Nageer. Thank you for the question, Chairman Crapo.\nAs you know that in your original opening statement, there\nhave been a few levers that have been adjusted during the\ncourse of the lifecycle of TRIPRA currently, and the insurers\nwith adequate notice have been able to adjust to these\nincremental changes, either to the increased trigger levels or\nthe increased coinsurance between a loss being shared between\nthe Government as well as the private marketplace.\nSo in terms of having the ability and the capacity in the\nmarketplace to be able to respond and take up increases in\nthese different levers, the capacity does exist because there\nis adequate capital within the insurance and reinsurance market\nbase for these types of incremental changes, but I stress the\nword ``incremental,'' and I stress the word also with some good\nnotice as well. So you have got to give them some time to sort\nof prep for these changes and make it incremental so they can\nadjust their buying of reinsurance for example, or being able\nto plan ahead and structure their--the book of business that\nthey underwrite properly.\nIn terms of policyholders and insurers, who could be\nimpacted by this, the very large insurers, one of the triggers\nunder TRIPRA is the 20 percent insurer deductible, and how that\nworks is 20 percent of the insurer's prior year's direct TRIPRA\npremium is retained by them for any one loss, before the\nGovernment co-shares the risk, the loss with them.\nSo for the very larger insurers, 20 percent is a big\nnumber, but my colleagues at Guy Carpenter have measured the\npolicyholder surplus of insurers with less than $500 million of\npolicyholder surplus, which is basically reserves. And there\nare about 662 insurers who fall within that category.\nAnd a subset of that 662 is about 240 insurers who fall\nbetween the $100 million and $500 million of policyholder\nsurplus, and those are the insurers who could be more directly\nimpacted negatively with abrupt increases in the trigger\nlevels. And the trigger in 2020 is going to be $200 million. So\nif you increased that gradually over time, yes, they could\nadjust for that, but that bucket of insurers within that $1 to\n$500 million policyholder surplus range are the ones who will\nbe more impacted.\nChairman Crapo. All right. Thank you.\nDr. Kunreuther, you in your testimony, I think, endorsed a\nnotion of incentivizing mitigation, something which you\nindicated is not currently in TRIA; is that correct?\nMr. Kunreuther. That is correct.\nChairman Crapo. Could you describe that in a little more\ndetail what you are talking about there?\nMr. Kunreuther. I would be happy to.\nI think the reason that I think mitigation is not included,\nnumber one, is it is always a challenge to get measures, but I\nthink there is work that has been done.\nI will highlight just at least the fact that Pool Re in the\nUnited Kingdom have actually had a number of ideas in terms and\nthoughts that they are working closely with the U.K. government\nto incentivize firms to actually invest in mitigation.\nThe basic idea in terms of what we are proposing here is\nthat if you can spread the cost of the mitigation measure over\ntime, you will have a much better chance of getting a\nsuccessful investment in these measures because of the fact\nthat people will not say--firms will not say or consumers will\nnot say, which is the case certainly in the flood area, that\n``This is too costly for us. It is going to affect our bottom\nline tomorrow.''\nAnd when you have the opportunity of actually spreading\nthis with loans that could be made--and that has been done by\nFEMA, Federal Emergency Management Agency, for flood--it could\nbe done by banks and financial institutions, but it could be\nalso done by Treasury or by a Government agency to encourage\nthose investments. You then have the opportunity of actually\nmaking this attractive in the short run because insurers\nhopefully would then--actually reduce their premiums because\nthe claims that they are going to have to face would be lower\nthan they would be before, and the actual premium reduction\nwould be greater than the cost of the loan each year. So it\nwould be viewed attractive financially for firms to want to do\nthat, and this has been shown with consumers in investing in\nmitigation measures against natural hazards that they will want\nto do that.\nAnd that is the reason why we are suggesting it, to\novercome a myopia bias.\nChairman Crapo. All right. Well, thank you. That is very\ninteresting. I appreciate that.\nSenator Brown.\nSenator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nMr. Webel, I would like to start with you. Since the last\nreauthorization, there have been a number of tragic white\nsupremacist attacks on synagogues and other places of worship\nin California, Florida, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania,\nSouth Carolina, and Texas. No amount, of course, of insurance\nmoney can make up for the lives lost and families torn apart.\nRecently, the Jewish Federation of Cleveland has raised an\nissue about protecting thousands of people whom they serve each\nweek. As religiously affiliated nonprofit organizations try to\ntake action to protect their communities, they often find that\ninsurance for these kinds of threats is hard to come by and\nvery, very expensive. TRIA was implemented to make sure this\nkind of insurance was available.\nMy question is this: Do you think this situation, safety at\nhouses of worship and other religious institutions, which we\nhave been the target of threats and attacks, that that is the\nkind of problem TRIA was designed to address?\nMr. Webel. TRIA is designed to address terrorism, and it is\na broad swath. It does not specify.\nIn one of the previous reauthorizations, they removed the\nrequirement for it to be a foreign act of terrorism. So it does\nnot make any distinction between the different types of\nterrorism. It just is terrorism as certified by the Secretary\nof the Treasury.\nSenator Brown. If insurance is available but priced so high\nthat it is unaffordable, does that meet the spirit of Congress'\nintent?\nMr. Webel. The law is basically silent on that. It has a\n``make available'' provision, but it does not include\nspecifications on what that premium is supposed to cost.\nSenator Brown. Is not it sort of intuitive that if you\ncannot afford it, you really do not have access to it?\nMr. Webel. This is certainly an issue, and basically,\nimplicitly what the law provides is there are specifications in\nState insurance law that premiums are not supposed to be\nexcessive and so essentially above the cost of the risk.\nSo the TRIA essentially defaults to the State regulation of\ninsurance. It does not do it directly from the Federal level.\nSenator Brown. So if congressional intent is all terrorism,\nas you suggest, and it is not affordable because State\nregulators have not given the priority to make it accessible\nand affordable, then perhaps it is our obligation on this\nCommittee and in the House and Senate to pressure our State\nregulators to make it affordable?\nMr. Webel. That would be the lever that TRIA provides, yes,\nessentially.\nSenator Brown. Treasury used its discretion under the law\nto issue guidance clarifying TRIA's applicability to cyber-\nrelated risk. Do you think Treasury has the authority to make\nsure religious-affiliated institutions have real access to the\nTerrorism Risk Insurance Program?\nMr. Webel. I do not see under the statute, as currently\ndesigned, where Treasury would have a direct lever to do that.\nSenator Brown. Should it?\nMr. Webel. That is up to Congress.\nSenator Brown. Mr. Nageer, let me go through. Do you want\nto respond to that?\nMr. Nageer. If I could, if you do not mind. So, just to\nadd, the terrorism marketplace as we see it is quite\ncompetitive. There are lots of insurers, both on the property\nside, casualty side, and the terrorism side who have capacity\nto offer terrorism insurance for all ranges of motives, be it\nwhat you were just describing or what is conventionally known\nas acts of terrorism. So there is enough capacity within the\nmarketplace, and I think to be able to--and TRIA served--in its\ninitial creation of TRIA served to help create that vibrant\nmarketplace.\nSenator Brown. Well, there is competition in the healthcare\nmarketplace too, but to argue that it is always accessible----\nMr. Nageer. Right.\nSenator Brown.----is another question. OK. Thank you for\nthat.\nLet me ask the three of you and start with you, Mr. Nageer.\nI have a couple questions. As we look to move on a\nreauthorization bill, should we make the extension for a longer\nperiod, and how long should it actually be, Mr. Nageer?\nIf each of you would give me a brief answer on that.\nMr. Nageer. The last reauthorization was for 5 years.\nBefore that, it was for 7 years. The 7 years worked quite well.\nSo I think anywhere between 7 to 10 years would be a good\noutcome. It would allow the marketplace to adapt and grow,\nbuild capital, and be able to take on more of a trigger or a\ncoinsurance mechanism, however you want to----\nSenator Brown. I like the way you negotiate. You say the\nlast was 5, the one before was 7.\nMr. Nageer. Correct.\nSenator Brown. So we should make it 7 to 10. I like that.\nYes, go ahead. Your answer too. Do you want to answer too?\nMr. Kunreuther. I would be happy to.\nI think a longer period is always desirable, but I think\nthere are tradeoffs in doing that because when you have a\nlonger period, the question is, are there going to be changes\nor things that would require one to review this and whatnot? So\nto the extent that there are opportunities at least to have\nstudies done that would enable one to somehow say on the basis\nof possible changes, one would want to deal with this in a\ndifferent way, I think cyber is a very good example of that, by\nthe way, because there are some real challenges as to how one\nis going to deal with cyber. And that would not have been\nnecessarily true 5 or 10 years ago.\nSo I think I would favor, in general, a longer period of\ntime. How long, I think is something that Congress and the\nstakeholders would have to discuss, because it gives people and\ngives firms the opportunity to plan more extensively than\nknowing that somehow things might be changed. And so I would\nmove in that direction.\nThere is a saying--and I think TRIA exhibits it in a very\ngood way--that nothing is more permanent than the temporary,\nand so, in some sense, what was viewed as a temporary has\nbecome more permanent for very good reason. So that is one of\nthe reasons why we support the renewal very strongly.\nSenator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Kunreuther.\nMr. Webel?\nMr. Webel. We obviously do not have a position on the\nlength.\nI do think purely from the private-sector perspective,\ninsurers certainly would be able to deal better with things the\nlonger that it is, but I do think there is a very legitimate\npublic policy perspective that Dr. Kunreuther said of taking a\nlook at things more often to make sure that it is working.\nSenator Brown. Thank you.\nChairman Crapo. Senator Tillis.\nSenator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nGentlemen, thank you for being here.\nMr. Webel, I will not ask you this question because I know\nthe answer. It has to do with supporting the reauthorization.\nBoth of you all feel like we should reauthorize it, although,\nProfessor Kunreuther, you have made some comments that I wanted\nto drill down on, and it really has to do--and I think, Mr.\nNageer, you commented that the losses have been relatively low.\nSo how instructive are the current incidences to any sort\nof downward trend on risk premiums right now? I mean, are we\nseeing a downward trend based on the losses, or how do they\nproject out actuarially and determine how much they actually\nhave to collect to provide insurance at a reasonable price?\nMr. Nageer. In terms of the marketplace, yes, it is a bit\nof a downward trend for this because the insurers, like I said,\nhave all capitalized, and they have not had to pay major claims\nrecently, right?\nSenator Tillis. Yeah.\nDr. Kunreuther, if we were going to look at--first, I do\nnot believe we should have a permanent reauthorization because\nI do believe the world changes. The nature of the threats\nchange, and it is Congress' role to update and reauthorize\nthese programs.\nI do think that we should have a discussion about what a\nreasonable planning horizon is so that we can optimize the\nproducts that the private sector can offer.\nBut if you take a look at the recoupment, the current\nrecoupment policies, really the pyramid of how this program\ncomes together, do you have any insights into specific areas\nthat we should look at for any sort of modernization or\nreforms?\nMr. Kunreuther. Thank you for the question, Senator Tillis.\nI think that one of the challenges with respect to\nterrorism and events that are very, very hard to estimate the\nrisk is that when you have a recoupment, you are not pushing\nfor a premium to be set on these very catastrophic losses that\nthe Government would cover. And I think there are some real\nadvantages to that in the sense that you are then saying you\nwill have to pay it back with 140 percent in this particular\ncase. So I would favor that aspect of it.\nI think a real interesting question that needs to be put on\nthe table as a part of the discussion is, What kind of risk\ntransfer mechanisms are available in the form of reinsurance\nand catastrophe bonds, which are being used in other cases?\nSenator Tillis. That was going to be my next question.\nMr. Kunreuther. Oh, OK.\nSenator Tillis. No, that is a good one. Keep going.\nMr. Kunreuther. And how can that play an important role in\nproviding the kind of protection that firms would actually want\nto have, that insurers would want to have in terms of knowing\nthat they can cover it, and the Government might want to have?\nI think Pool Re, as I mentioned earlier, in the United\nKingdom has marketed a cat bond in order to be able to support\nvery unusual losses that they might suffer in the United\nKingdom, and that could be possibly considered by the Federal\nGovernment as well. And I think on that level, you could have a\ncombination of the recoupment as well as these other forms of\nrisk transfer, including private reinsurance.\nSenator Tillis. One of the questions, you brought up the\npoint of mitigation, which has really been a thorn in my side\non flood insurance program because we always talk about it, and\nwe never do anything about it----\nMr. Kunreuther. Challenge.\nSenator Tillis.----in terms of investing and for a lot of\nreasons, cost being one of them.\nBut when you take a look at the nature of the threat,\nreally the nature of the threat as it exists today versus 10\nyears ago, it would seem like there is only so much that we\ncould do with respect to mitigation. Can you enlighten me on\nsome of the concepts that are being discussed now?\nMr. Kunreuther. I think that is an excellent point in terms\nof saying that this is a real challenge with terrorism and on a\ncouple of levels. That might not be the case with flood, where\nyou can mitigate. You can elevate a structure.\nSenator Tillis. You know when the water is going to rise,\nand you can model that.\nMr. Kunreuther. Right.\nSenator Tillis. But you cannot necessarily model the next\nattempt to take down a building.\nMr. Kunreuther. I am not an expert at the moment but want\nto be more of an expert in the future. And I can comment that\nin the context of the United Kingdom, there are some\nsuggestions for mitigation that they are now pursuing with the\ngovernment, concrete structures, other ways to actually make\nthese structures safer against terrorist attacks. And they are\ngoing to be working with insurers as well as with the\ngovernment to try to deal with it.\nI think one of the reasons that this is so important is\nbecause we all want to reduce these losses, and to the extent\nthat you can do that, I think it might help.\nSenator Tillis. Well, I think that the more we become\nhardened, the fewer targets a terrorist would have. So I think\nit has a public safety benefit as well. It maybe takes out an\nentire tranche of either domestic or foreign terrorist. So, to\nme, it is a very interesting discussion to have as we move\nforward through the reauthorization to see if there is\nsomething as a matter of public policy that we should incent\nState, local, and private-sector entities to invest in, because\nat the end of the day, I think it could also reduce the Federal\nGovernment's downside risk.\nMr. Kunreuther. If I can make just one very quick point, it\ndoes also address the affordability issue.\nSenator Tillis. Yeah.\nMr. Kunreuther. If you then can have mitigation in place,\npremiums could come down, and some of the comments that were\nraised earlier could----\nSenator Tillis. And ultimately the cost of the mitigation\nitself----\nMr. Kunreuther. Yeah.\nSenator Tillis.----when you have a higher demand for it.\nThank you, Mr. Chair, and I look forward to us moving\nforward and getting the plan maybe modernized, but certainly\nreauthorized.\nMr. Nageer. Senator, if I could add something else to\nHoward.\nSo, as we move from these hardened target, you get more\nbetter protected against those targets. Softer targets appear,\nand what we have been seeing is the act of terrorism impacts\nnot only major cities, but it is also spread across the rest of\nthe country, smaller cities, more softer targets, where a\nperpetrator can actually get in and do some serious damage\nbecause they cannot get into these hardened targets.\nThe interest of terrorism, we see it as being a nationwide\nhard, soft, small-city, big-city issue well across the country.\nSenator Tillis. Thank you.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you.\nSenator Menendez.\nSenator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nAs a general matter, insurance markets in our country are\nprivate, and it is unusual to have any kind of Federal\nbackstop, unless we have a public interest or a breakdown in\nthe private market where a Government role is needed to restore\nfunctionality.\nIn the case of Terrorism Risk Insurance, in my view, we\nhave both. If terrorists attack our Country, the United States\nhas a national interest in minimizing the economic harm they\ninflict, and in terms of market functionality, private actors\nare inherently limited in the things they can do to evaluate\nand reduce their risk in this regard.\nInsurance companies, for example, should not start their\nown intelligence agencies to improve their predictive models,\nand commercial real estate owners should not conduct\ncounterterrorism operations to lower their premiums.\nSo I would like to ask our witnesses, if you can, to\nelaborate on what makes terrorism different from other risks\nand why a Federal backstop is, in fact, needed.\nMr. Kunreuther. I will be happy to start, and my colleagues\nwill chime in.\nI think one of the real challenges with terrorism is that\nit is so very difficult to estimate what the likelihood of a\nterrorist attack will be in the future. We have been very\nfortunate not to have had anything since 9/11, but the fact of\nthe matter is that prior to 9/11, the insurers were not worried\nabout this, and after 9/11, they became very worried, as we all\nknow. And that is one of the reasons why TRIA got passed, and I\nthink it was very important that it did get passed for the\nreasons you were mentioning, Representative Menendez. So I\nappreciate your question.\nI think the fact that catastrophic losses and the potential\nfor catastrophic losses will discover any private insurer from\nactually offering coverage, and TRIA does precisely that. It\nhas the backstop of actually providing the protection, with a\nrecoupment that I think is appropriate afterwards, for dealing\nwith these large losses.\nAnd then the insurers have now found, as Tarique has\nindicated with respect to his comments on the Marsh report,\nthat there are really a number of firms that are now willing to\nbuy coverage and all insurers are forced to offer it.\nSo I think this kind of partnership is the appropriate way.\nThere are changes that we can discuss.\nSenator Menendez. The one thing about terrorism, as someone\nwho offered all of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations into\nlaw when I was in the House of Representatives, is that we do\nnot know what the next form of terrorism is going to be or its\nmagnitude.\nWe never thought that an airplane, something used for\ncivilian travel, would become a weapon of mass destruction.\nWe never thought that maybe cargo coming into a port could\nultimately have a dirty bomb.\nWe never thought that an envelope laced with anthrax could\nbe a deadly weapon.\nSo the iterations of what this is is always beyond even as\nwe think ahead and try to prevent. It is a challenge. So I\nthink it is a very unique one.\nI mean, in order to obtain a real estate or commercial\nloan, banks often generally require clients to obtain terrorism\ncoverage. Without terrorism risk insurance, businesses lose out\non essential financing options, and I think allowing TRIA to\nlapse or injecting uncertainty in the process can have serious\neconomic consequences.\nMr. Nageer, what happened to the commercial lending in real\nestate markets in 2014 when Congress allowed TRIA to expire for\n12 days?\nMr. Nageer. Thank you for the question, Senator Menendez.\nSo before I answer that question, I just want to add one\nthing to the modeling, your question before that.\nTRIA--an act of terrorism is not like an act of nature,\nright? Someone actually has to decide, ``I am going to\nperpetrate this act of terrorism.'' So that is very difficult\nfor insurers to model, that uncertainty, that human element of\nit, and that is one of the issues.\nObviously, we have got a ton of data points on the\nreinsurance side for natural disasters. For catastrophic\nterrorism events, 9/11 is the key data point on the model, and\nit does not help. You cannot be predictable with that. You can\ndetermine the impact of these events, but you cannot predict\nthem. So this is why it is very difficult for insurers to model\nit.\nIn terms of what happened in 2014, the uncertainty, it was\nvery hectic. I was in the insurance market at that time, and\ninsurers on property policies as well as workers' compensation\npolicies, when they were considering policies which were going\nto go past December 31, 2014, started putting sunset provisions\non policies, and a sunset clause is essentially a clause which\nsays we elect--we reserve the right to change policies in terms\nof the limits, the coverages, and the prices for what we are\noffering you for terrorism insurance.\nSo once you got into the window of the TRIPRA potentially\nnot renewing at the end of 2014, we saw a preponderance of\nthese sunset classes on clients buying insurance, starting in\nJanuary 1st of 2013.\nAs you go into the next renewal of 2020, any policy which\nrenews comes into force on January 1, 2020, will expire January\n1, 2021, and those policies have a high possibility of having\nthese sunset clauses being put on it.\nSenator Menendez. Mr. Chairman, a final note.\nI assume that if you are having a financial instrument, a\nloan, a mortgage, whatever, that has multiple years and your\ninsurance is sunsetting within the context of that time period,\nthat is going to make the lending institution far less desirous\nof making that a reality.\nMr. Nageer. Absolutely.\nAnd the lender requirements on construction deals, long-\nterm construction deals, or clients with these lender\nrequirements make it quote onerous because that client then has\nto go purchase insurance in an alternative market, which is\ngoing to be added cost to their construction project or\nwhatever it may be. And that market is available, but maybe not\nto the extent to replace the limit the clients would have\ngotten on TRIA.\nSenator Menendez. Maybe so.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you.\nSenator Reed.\nSenator Reed. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nThank you, gentlemen.\nMr. Webel, could you please briefly describe how nuclear,\nbiological, chemical, radiological terrorism events are treated\nunder TRIA?\nMr. Webel. Sure. Thank you for the question.\nNBCR is treated essentially like any other mode of attack.\nThat is to say, it all works through the private insurance\npolicies.\nWhat is particular about NBCR is most private insurance\npolicies would exclude this damage, regardless of whether it\nwas an accidental event or whether it was a terrorist event,\nand if the private insurance policies exclude it, it is\neffectively excluded under TRIA.\nSo, for example, Senator Menendez just mentioned a dirty\nbomb or an anthrax attack. In reality, if a catastrophic attack\noccurred along those lines, it is entirely possible, if not\nlikely, that TRIA coverage would not actually kick in because\nthe private insurance policies that essentially underlie the\nTRIA coverage would not cover it.\nSenator Reed. In that context, as we reauthorize TRIA, do\nyou have any suggested changes with respect to these NBCR\npolicies?\nMr. Webel. It is difficult because the TRIA mechanism has\nworked really well through the private market and allowing the\nState regulators to do the things that they do, allowing the\nprivate insurance companies to do the things that they do.\nIt would certainly be possible from a generic perspective\nto put aspects of TRIA directly affecting those. In the\noriginal TRIA, there were terrorism exclusions that were\nnullified. So it is certainly within Congress' authority to do\nsomething like that with regard to NBCR.\nIt would also be possible to put more incentives,\nessentially, into it. There have been proposals in the past to\nlower the deductibles, lower the trigger, lower the co-shares\nfor an NBCR event, essentially incentivizing insurers to make\nthe coverage or perhaps a mixture of the two approaches.\nMr. Kunreuther. Could I just make one comment following up\non Mr. Webel's point?\nI think that TRIA always had the intent that if the private\ninsurers were not covering NBCR, then there would be some\ncoverage by the Federal Government, if there was an NBCR loss,\nbut it was sort of ambiguous in the sense that it was not\nreally explicitly stated.\nBut after the passage of TRIPRA in 2015, there was a\ncomment by Treasury that they would be doing that.\nI think if one explicitly had that in the legislation that\nthe Federal Government would cover that, it would avoid any of\nthe uncertainty as to what might happen if there was an NBCR\nattack.\nSenator Reed. Thank you.\nMr. Webel. But I think the question is what the mechanism\nwould be because the mechanism for covering losses all works\nthrough the private insurance policies. It is a reimbursement\nto private insurance companies that have sustained losses. If\nthey are not effectively sustaining losses because of the\nexclusion, how that mechanism would work is very unclear.\nMr. Kunreuther. And the only suggestion that I would make\non that is that there would be a recoupment----\nMr. Webel. Yes.\nMr. Kunreuther.----afterwards with respect to that, and\nthat would be explicitly stated.\nSenator Reed. The environment has obviously changed since\nwe first passed the TRIA Act, Mr. Webel. What things should we\ndo for this changing environment?\nI know, again, my colleague, Senator Menendez, was talking\nabout who would have thought of an envelope with anthrax, et\ncetera. Certainly, in the realm of cyber, who would have\nthought that and name the possible catastrophes? Is there any\nadvice about changes?\nMr. Webel. I think that cyber is the thing that people are\nlooking at as the new threat, and Treasury specifically came\nout in 2016 and said the newly created cyber liability line of\ninsurance would be covered under TRIA.\nSo to the extent the private policies are covering cyber,\nagain, it would do so, but I think that there is certainly the\npossibility of using the TRIA model or incentivizing or\nencouraging the market for cyber by explicitly including it in\nTRIA in some way because I think it is also a little unclear in\nterms of the damages that are being incurred in a cyber attack\nand whether that would meet triggers, whether that would meet\ndeductibles and the like. And that is, I think, a real issue.\nSenator Reed. Well, thank you all, gentlemen, for your\ntestimony. I appreciate it very much.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you, Senator Reed.\nAnd that concludes the questioning for today's hearing.\nFor Senators who wish to submit questions for the record,\nthose questions are due by Tuesday, June 25th.\nTo our witnesses, I suspect you may get a fair number of\nthose because, as you can see, there were a number of other\nhearings and other interruptions today that caused us to not\neven be able to get a quorum for our Executive Session. So I\nthink a lot of the Senators are probably going to submit some\nquestions to you. We ask that as you receive those questions\nthat you respond as promptly as you can.\nAgain, we want to thank you for your expertise and for\nsharing your wisdom as well as your research with us today, and\nthis hearing is adjourned.\n[Whereupon, at 11:33 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]\n[Prepared statements, responses to written questions, and\nadditional material supplied for the record follow:]\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN MIKE CRAPO\nToday, we are joined by three witnesses who have evaluated and\nwritten extensively on the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, including\nMr. Tarique Nageer, Terrorism Placement and Advisory Leader with Marsh;\nDr. Howard Kunreuther, Co-Director of the Wharton Risk Management and\nDecision Processes Center; and Mr. Baird Webel, Specialist in Financial\nEconomics with the Congressional Research Service.\nThe terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, devastated U.S.\ncitizens, households and businesses.\nIn the wake of those attacks, Congress passed and the President\nsigned into law the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 to establish\nthe Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or TRIP, and to stabilize the\nmarket for terrorism risk insurance.\nSince then, Congress has reauthorized the Program three different\ntimes in 2005, 2007, and 2015.\nMy goal in each reauthorization was to build on existing data to\nfind ways for the private insurance industry to absorb and cover the\nlosses for all but the largest acts of terror, ones in which the\nFederal Government would likely be forced to step in were the program\nnot there.\nCongress made several improvements to the Program during the 2015\nreauthorization. It increased the program trigger from $100 million to\n$200 million in increments of $20 million each year; increased the\nlevel below which insurers are subject to mandatory recoupment $2\nbillion each year to what is now a floating amount based on insurers'\ndeductibles; and decreased the coinsurance rate from 85 percent to 80\npercent in 1 percent increments each year.\nThat bill garnered overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate\nwith a vote of 93 to 4.\nThe Program is once again set to expire on December 31, 2020.\nWell ahead of that expiration date, the Banking Committee has\nalready started meeting with key stakeholders and is exploring whether\nthere are additional balanced reforms to improve the Program and reduce\ntaxpayer exposure without having a material negative effect on the cost\nand take-up rates for terrorism coverage.\nIn 2018, the Treasury Department issued a report on the Program's\neffectiveness, which also discussed key developments in the marketplace\nfor terrorism risk insurance.\nIn addition to Treasury concluding in the report that ``The Program\nhas accomplished its principle goals identified in TRIA,'' Treasury\nalso observed that ``Private reinsurance of terrorism risk has\nsignificantly increased under the Program, and there is now increased\nprivate reinsurance capacity for the exposures that remain wholly with\nthe private market under TRIP.''\nEach of today's witnesses has written extensively on the Program's\neffectiveness, structure and market developments.\nIn 2018, Dr. Kunreuther co-authored a report on the Program, which\nfound that ``Overall, TRIA has worked well. It has stabilized a very\ndisrupted market in the aftermath of 2001, making terrorism insurance\nwidely available and affordable. Take-up rates among enterprises small\nand large are rather high and premiums a few percentage points of what\nfirms pay for their property insurance, even though cost and take-up\nrates vary widely by size, industry, geography, and line of business.''\nIn its 2019 Terrorism Risk Insurance Report, Marsh discussed take-\nup rates, as well as cost, geographic and corporate trends in terrorism\nrisk insurance in the United States, as well as globally.\nMarsh emphasized in the report that `` . . . the Federal backstop\ncreated by TRIA and reauthorized as TRIPRA--along with similar public-\nprivate mechanisms that exist in other countries--remains crucial to\nthe continued stability and health of the property terrorism insurance\nmarket.''\nFinally, the Congressional Research Service has published numerous\nreports, including one as recently as April 2019, providing a\ncomprehensive overview of the Program, its history, statutory changes\nin past reauthorizations and key considerations for this Congress.\nDuring this hearing, I look forward to hearing more about: specific\nconsiderations in evaluating the Program's effectiveness; how the\nProgram has evolved over time; how the marketplace has responded to\nchanges to the Program made by Congress in previous reauthorizations;\nwhat additional room exists to further reduce taxpayer exposure; and\nhow different market participants may react to changes in different\nProgram levers.\nThank you all for joining us today to share your perspectives and\nresearch.\n______\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR SHERROD BROWN\nThank you Senator Crapo for holding the Committee's first hearing\non the reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program. While\nthe Program expires at the end of next year, after the lapse at the end\nof 2014 we all understand that we need to start early to make sure that\ndoes not happen again.\nThe Terrorism Risk Insurance Program is critical to keeping our\neconomy healthy. TRIA isn't just a program that helps in the event of a\nterrorist attack. Many businesses rely on this insurance in order to\nget access to credit, even in healthy economic times. Without\nGovernment assistance, the insurance market would be unable to provide\naffordable insurance to these businesses, including small businesses,\nacross the country.\nWhile TRIA was initially designed to be temporary after 9-11,\nRepublicans and Democrats have agreed several times since then that\nthere is value in keeping it. People may hear the word ``terrorism''\nand think this doesn't apply to their community, that only businesses\nin places like New York and Washington or big national landmarks would\nneed to worry about insuring against terrorism.\nBut unfortunately, terrorism isn't confined to big cities and the\ngroups perpetrating it don't only come from abroad. Ohio communities\nthat have faced threats from white supremacists groups know all too\nwell that this is a risk we all have to contend with.\nThat's why I'm glad we've been able to work on it in a bipartisan\nway. We all agree there are some issues that the free market just can't\nsolve on its own. This is one of them, and it's an example of the kind\nof successful Government intervention that is only possible when we\ncome together as a country.\nThere are some in Congress who would prefer the United States not\nmake these kinds of guarantees--whether it's for workers' pensions and\nSocial Security, for mortgages and affordable housing, for healthcare\nand food for low-income families, or for protections against economic\ndestruction after terrorist attacks. Some politicians just aren't\ninterested in coming together on behalf of Americans that live in\nMansfield or Cleveland or Chillicothe in Ohio, or in Boise or Idaho\nFalls from the Chairman's State.\nI disagree, and I think the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program is\nemblematic of our ability to use Government to make the economy work\nbetter for everybody, especially during the most difficult of times. As\nwe look at other issues on this Committee, I hope we will remember the\nsuccess of this program, and our capacity to use Government to solve\ntough problems when we work together.\nIn the last bipartisan authorization of the Program, we worked to\nstrike a balance, which seems to work well. By increasing the program\ntrigger to $200 million and gradually reducing the Government's share\nin the losses, we've made the program efficient without decreasing\naccess to coverage. We have an opportunity to make the program even\nstronger by creating certainty in the marketplace through a long-term\nextension of the program. I hope we can work together to do that.\nI look forward to hearing the witnesses' testimony today.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR MENENDEZ FROM TARIQUE\nNAGEER\nQ.1. TRIA reauthorization is particularly important to my home\nState of New Jersey, where there is a high population density,\nimportant cultural centers and landmarks, and major\ninfrastructure, including ports, rail, and highways.\nWhat are the consequences of letting TRIA expire for high\ntarget States like New Jersey?\nA.1. If TRIA is allowed to expire or is substantially changed,\nand the mandatory make-available provision is removed, insurers\nwould not be obliged to offer terrorism coverage. Additionally,\nthe TRIA premium charged by insurers without the backstop in\nplace is likely to be considerably higher. The United States is\nthe world's largest buyer of terrorism insurance, and U.S.-\nbased organizations continue to purchase coverage at a high\nrate. In 2018, the take-up rate for TRIPRA coverage embedded in\nU.S. property policies was 62 percent (see Figure 4). Take-up\nrates have remained close to 60 percent over the last several\nyears.\nPotentially, property reinsurance capacity and competition\ncould positively influence the supply of terrorism capacity;\nhowever, available coverage and limits would not be as readily\navailable in certain cities. In particular, this may impact\ncompanies that have substantial property exposures in central\nbusiness districts and where reinsurance capacity would be\ndiminished and insufficient to meet insurers' demands.\nAdditionally, some industries are susceptible to certain\ninsurance requirements, such as mortgage lender requirements\nwith real estate companies. Within TRIA's current structure,\nthe limits available for terrorism insurance are typically\nsufficient for real estate companies to meet their risk\ntransfer and lender requirement needs. A change in the Act's\nstructure could potentially cause a gap in demand and\navailability. This susceptibility is not limited to ``central\nbusiness districts'' or major cities.\nThe main alternative for a property terrorism risk transfer\nmechanism if TRIA is not reauthorized would be the standalone\nterrorism insurance market. As standalone capacity is finite,\nthe cost of this capacity likely would be considerably higher\nin areas or cities where demand is high, such as major\nmetropolitan areas, central business districts, iconic\nbuildings, ports/airports and even ``soft targets'' such as\nshopping malls.\nThis market dynamic varies considerably by location. In\ncertain high-risk cities--such as New York, San Francisco,\nChicago, Houston, Atlanta or Washington, D.C.--the cost of\nstandalone terrorism insurance capacity can be multiples of the\ncurrent pricing for TRIA embedded as part of property programs.\nOrganizations that employ captives also are likely to be\naffected in the event TRIA is allowed to expire or is\nsignificantly changed. Captives are widely used to supplement\nwhat is available in the commercial market, and, in some cases\ncaptive insurers are the only available option for certain\nlayers and/or perils. This is most common in areas of higher\nperceived risk, such as for property or employee-related\ncoverages in major cities. Generally speaking, since captives\nare best suited to primary operating layers, or as a mechanism\nfor accessing risk transfer solutions, it is very likely that,\nabsent TRIA, captive utilization for terrorism coverage would\nchange significantly.\nIn addition to property insurance, other coverage lines\nlikely will be impacted if TRIA expires or is significantly\nchanged, particularly workers' compensation insurance, as\nworkers' compensation insurers are not permitted to exclude\nterrorism from their policies. Insurers are concerned about\npotential aggregation of risk, which may impact the\navailability of workers' compensation insurance should TRIA\nmaterially change or expire. Where these insurers are also\noffering other lines of insurance, such as property, the\ncombined aggregate exposure likely will further limit their\nability or willingness to offer substantial property limits.\nLikely impacts that the absence of or a serious\nmodification of TRIA could have on the workers' compensation\nmarket are in the areas of pricing and capacity. It is expected\nthat the reinsurance market would likely increase pricing\nbecause of the increased potential exposure. This would, in\nturn, have a trickle-down effect on the primary workers'\ncompensation marketplace. Further, the ability of insurers to\nuse reinsurance capacity to manage their maximum tolerable\nlosses could prove more difficult, especially for the terrorism\nperils of NBCR events. This could significantly alter carriers'\nrisk appetites and their willingness to offer coverage to\nemployers with large employee accumulations.\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nQ.2. What are consequences of letting TRIA expire for\ncommunities around the country that are home to critical\ninfrastructure such as rail lines, power plants, highways,\nairports, or pipelines? If these investments become more\ncostly, doesn't that have a nationally adverse impact?\nA.2. There is insufficient standalone terrorism capacity to\ncost effectively replace TRIA. This will result in increased\nterrorism insurance costs and insurance market dislocation for\nrisks in the commercial real estate sector. This could result\nin negative economic impact for industries affected by this\ndislocation.\nThe main alternative for a property terrorism risk transfer\nmechanism if TRIA is not reauthorized would be the standalone\nterrorism insurance market. Since standalone capacity is\nfinite, the cost of this capacity likely would be considerably\nhigher in areas or cities where demand is high, such as major\nmetropolitan areas, central business districts, iconic\nbuildings, ports/airports for example.\nThe percentage of companies that purchased terrorism\ninsurance--and the amount they spent on terrorism insurance as\na portion of their overall premiums--varied significantly by\nindustry in 2018. Education institutions, media organizations,\nfinancial institutions, and real estate companies were the most\nfrequent buyers while transportation and hospitality and gaming\ncompanies spent the most on terrorism as a percentage of their\ntotal premium spend due to their perceived vulnerability (see\nFigure 5).\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nGlobal dedicated reinsurance capital is estimated to be\n$440 billion; dedicated reinsurance capital in North America is\nestimated to be between $120 billion and $140 billion.\nReinsurance capacity for terrorism, however, is dependent on a\nreinsurer's preference, appetite, expertise and aggregate\nconstraints.\nIt is not unforeseeable that changes to the backstop could\nresult in a withdrawal of smaller carriers away from the\nterrorism segment, while larger carriers may or may not\ncontinue to write--and absorb more--risk throughout the cycle\nof market dislocation. This would have an impact on the\nmarketplace with fewer options available for small businesses,\npotentially higher insurance expenses and less available for\ngrowth and investments.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR WARREN FROM TARIQUE\nNAGEER\nQ.1. Certain mass shootings, such as those that occurred in Las\nVegas, NV, Sutherland Springs, TX, and Newtown, CT, have not\nbeen certified by the Treasury Secretary as acts of terrorism.\nTherefore, these incidents have not been regarded as qualifying\nevents for terrorism risk insurance, in part, because those\nattacks did not meet current law's requirement of being ``part\nof an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United\nStates or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the\nUnited States Government by coercion.'' Given the high\nfrequency of mass shootings in the United States, is there a\npublic policy interest in certifying certain mass shootings\ncommitted by individuals as qualifying events for terrorism\nrisk insurance purposes, even if they are not demonstrably\nintended to coerce Americans or influence U.S. Government\npolicy? Please explain why or why not.\nA.1. Unfortunately, mass shootings are an important topic and,\nas such, there are policy initiatives underway to address them.\nThe private insurance market has developed forms of coverage to\nrespond to active assailant threats--helping organizations and\nindividuals victimized by such attacks to recover and mitigate\ntheir future risk. This insurance, active assailant coverage,\ncomplements the general liability and property coverage that\nmost businesses already purchase, offering another layer of\nprotection against the threat of assailants. Various active\nassailant insurance products available via commercial insurers\ntypically offer affirmative coverage that is triggered by\npremediated malicious physical attacks by active assailants who\nare physically present and armed. These policies can typically\noffer:\nA.  Property damage, business interruption, and extra expense\ncoverage;\nB.  Legal liability coverage;\nC.  Nonphysical damage coverage;\nD.  Loss of revenue and denial of access coverage;\nE.  Reimbursement for costs for public relations consulting,\ncrisis management, medical services, counseling and/or\npsychiatric care, hiring of additional staff and added\nsecurity.\nBeyond purchasing insurance coverage, it's vital that\nbusinesses carefully consider their potential risk and actively\nengage in\nprevention and response preparedness activities to help reduce\nthe\npotential loss of life, injuries, and damage to their and\nothers'\nproperty. The Department of Homeland Security offers various\nactive shooter preparation guidance on its website: https://\nwww.dhs.gov/cisa/active-shooter-preparedness.\nPlease see Addendum 1 for additional information on\ndedicated coverage for active assailant events.\nQ.2. According to Congressional Research Service (CRS)\nspecialist Baird Webel's written testimony, the current\nterrorism risk insurance program ``protect[s] consumers--by\nrequiring insurers that offer [Terrorism Risk Insurance Act]-\ncovered lines of insurance to make terrorism insurance\navailable prospectively to their commercial policyholders.''\nAre there other actions that Congress or Federal agencies could\ntake that would enhance protections for consumers in the\nterrorism risk insurance market?\nA.2. Terrorism insurance pools should continue to evolve their\nscope and scale to provide the requisite response and stability\nfor companies to operate securely.\nCertain market segments are required to provide coverage\n(e.g., workers' compensation, unlimited, and for all terror\nperils) versus having greater flexibility (e.g., property\nterrorism, particularly nuclear, biological, chemical and\nradiological terrorism coverage, where it can be excluded if\nthe insured does not elect to purchase the coverage).\nIt would be beneficial to investigate requiring elements of\nnuclear, biological, chemical and radiological terrorism\ncoverage that would allow the Federal Government to reduce its\nexposure to uninsured losses resulting from a NBCR loss\nscenario and further develop the private market appetite.\nAny actions should be reviewed with due consideration to\navoid insurers pulling out of specific coverage lines, which\nwould thus have a negative effect on policyholders due to\nreduced availability.\nQ.3. According to CRS specialist Baird Webel's written\ntestimony, ``Federal law does not limit what insurers can\ncharge for terrorism risk insurance, although State regulators\ntypically have the authority under State law to modify\nexcessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory rates.''\nWhile one of the original goals of the Terrorism Risk Insurance\nProgram is to preserve State regulation of insurance, is there\na public policy interest in developing a Federal limit on what\ninsurers can charge for terrorism risk insurance, or is the\ncurrent State-centric framework sufficient to prevent abusive\npractices in the market?\nA.3. In the current marketplace, terrorism price competition\namong insurers is driven in part by modeling the exposure and\nreviewing correlated risks across multiple terrorism exposed\nlines of business (e.g., those insuring both property and\nworkers' compensation for the same risk(s)).\nInsurers measure their accumulations of risk and price\ntheir business based on the physical address level of data and\ndifferentiates those insured(s) with different risk profiles\nwithin each covered line of business.\nThe action to minimize the negative market impact arising\nfrom the uncertainty around TRIA's future and serve the\nmarketplace well would be to provide clear guidance on how a\nreauthorization might look, as soon as possible. Subject\npolicies with effective dates on (and after) January 1, 2020,\nthat are issued with annual terms, are creating a potential\n(and unknown) increased net exposure to insurers post the\nscheduled December 31, 2020, expiration of TRIA.\nThe uncertainty with TRIA will cause insurance carriers to\nconsider issuing unilateral policy endorsement provisions that\nwill allow them to increase the price for terrorism coverage\nmid-term once it is known how TRIA will look going forward\n(either materially changed or nonrenewed) post its expiration.\nThis effectively pushes the uncertainty in the market to the\ncommercial insurance buyers and employers of all sizes.\nFurther, it leaves open for interpretation the definition of\n``materially changed'' and eliminates the ability for the\ninsurance buyer to maintain coverage and cost certainty.\nQ.4. On December 27, 2016, the Treasury Department issued\n``guidance regarding how insurance recently classified as\n`Cyber Liability' for purposes of reporting premiums and losses\nto State insurance regulators will be treated under TRIA and\nTreasury's regulations for the Program (Program regulations).''\nThat guidance ``confirms that stand-alone cyber insurance\npolicies reported under the `Cyber Liability' line are included\nin the definition of `property and casualty insurance' under\nTRIA and are thus subject to the disclosure requirements and\nother requirements in TRIA and the Program regulations[.]\nFurthermore, that guidance noted, ``Cyber risk insurance\nremains an evolving insurance market, both in terms of product\ndevelopment and regulatory oversight.'' Similarly, cyberspace\nremains a consistently evolving threat environment. At this\ntime, would you recommend any updates to the Treasury\nDepartment's guidance on cyber insurance policies? Please\nexplain why or why not.\nA.4. TRIA serves an essential role to the insurance market by\ninjecting stability into several terrorism-related lines of\ninsurance. With regard to cybersecurity, terrorism remains a\npresent and growing threat vector. That risk is typically\ncovered under cyber insurance policies, but may also impact\nother lines of coverage, including property or workers'\ncompensation.\nOne hurdle for using TRIA to address acts of cyberterrorism\ncould be the challenge of attribution. ``Attribution of attacks\ncan be difficult. This is usually dependent on technical means\nof attribution. In malicious cyber actions, spoofing or\nobfuscation of an identity most often occurs. It is not easy to\nknow who conducts malicious cyber activity.''\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ ``Strategies for Resolving the Cyber Attribution Challenge,''\nU.S. Air Force Research Institute (accessed at https://\nmedia.defense.gov/2017/May/11/2001745613/-1/-1/0/CPP_0001_yanna\nkogeorgos_cyber_ttribution_challenge.pdf).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCongress should consider whether the Secretary of the\nTreasury can declare a certified act of terrorism without\ncertain attribution. Potentially, the Secretary could have the\nflexibility to certify an act of terrorism based on factors\nsuch as the objective of the attack and the impact of the\nattack.\nGuidance on the Secretary's flexibility could potential be\naddressed in the report language that accompanies the passage\nof a reauthorization of TRIPRA.\nAddendum 1\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR JONES FROM TARIQUE\nNAGEER\nQ.1. Cyber attacks are gaining traction as a preferred method\nto terrorize individuals and organizations. In 2016, the\nTreasury Department issued guidance that clarified\ncyberterrorism is included in TRIA.\nSome believe that Russia interference in the 2016\nPresidential election by manipulating voters with fake\nsocial media accounts is considered cyberterrorism.\nThis type of cyber-\nterrorism has immeasurable consequences and affects\nAmericans that would not even participate in TRIA.\nAdditionally, the Port of Mobile keeps track of\ncontainers that are to be shipped across the country.\nThe Port of Mobile is an important part of Alabama's\neconomy. If an organization decided to pressure Alabama\ninto particular policy positions by attacking their\ncomputer system it would have dramatic effects on\nbusiness owners dependent on the Port to ship their\nmerchandise.\nWhat cyberterrorism looks like and the effects on\npeople is very different from physical terrorist\nattacks. How should TRIA adapt to the growing\nprevalence of cyber attacks that gives private\ninsurance a backstop but also provides policy holders\nwith protection?\nA.1. In 2016, the U.S. Department of the Treasury responded to\nthe growing risk of cyberterrorism by clarifying that losses\nincurred under cyber insurance policies would be eligible under\nTRIA.\nAccordingly, TRIA may already serve as a backstop for cyber\ninsurance carriers in the event of a certified act of\ncyberterrorism. Moreover, acts of terrorism, including acts of\ncyberterrorism, may not qualify for TRIA because the impacts of\nthose attacks fail to meet the statutory loss thresholds.\nAt this time, there is no basis to believe that TRIA should\nbe altered to provide further support to the cyber insurance\nindustry, or to support other covered lines of insurance for\ncyber perils. However, Congress may consider how systemic risks\nmay arise from cyber attacks that do not qualify as acts of\ncyberterrorism, and how well the Nation is prepared to respond\nto such systemic attacks.\nQ.2. Often TRIA is discussed with large cities in mind, but\nmany smaller communities can be targets of terrorist\nactivities. This is shown with the Charleston, South Carolina,\nchurch shooting when a white supremacist murdered nine people.\nSmall communities like this are likely to receive insurance\nfrom local agents.\nAlso, Alabama is home to two extremely popular\nfootball teams, University of Alabama and Auburn\nUniversity. The Iron Bowl is an annual game between\nAlabama and Auburn and draws large crowds from each\nschool. This could easily be a target for terrorist\norganizations.\nHow would reforms to TRIA affect smaller\ncommunities, particularly their premiums and the extent\nof their coverage?\nA.2. A change in the $200m industry loss may have an outsized\nimpact on small carriers if:\nA.  A loss occurs in a region/facility with few other insured\nstructures or employees in close proximity;\nB.  The carrier in question is liable for the majority\ninsured loss, i.e., this is not a subscription risk and\nis placed almost entirely with one market;\nC.  In a year with a ``swarm'' of small attacks, the insurer\nin question takes a loss from one or two small-to-\nmoderate size losses, but the total damage to the U.S.\nproperty/casualty industry is not significant and fails\nto qualify for certification.\nSmall carriers could surmount this challenge by managing\ndeployed limits and diversifying their footprints away from\nregions/locations of peak exposures. This could come at the\ncost of competitiveness or availability of capacity for\npolicyholders and have a negative short-term impact on the\ncarrier.\nOne way to mitigate the impact of these changes would be to\nphase in the aggregate increase over a defined period of time,\ne.g., $25m increase per year for a decade. This would allow for\nmore manageable budgeting and business planning, and mitigate\nmarket disruption.\nChanging the company deductible, however, would likely have\nan even more pronounced impact, especially on the small\ninsurers. For example, if the company deductible were to\nincrease by 10 points to 30 percent, a majority of small-to-\nmedium sized carriers who rely more on TRIA's existence, and\nwhose program deductible represents the largest percentage of\npolicyholder surplus, will have to re-strategize regarding the\ncompany's:\nA.  Defined per occurrence risk tolerance;\nB.  Reinsurance buying strategy;\nC.  Aggregate amount of limit deployed in the marketplace;\nD.  Pricing for terrorism risk;\nE.  Ratings agency scrutiny.\nRatings agency scrutiny is particularly important for small\nand mutual carriers. Carriers must submit annual assessments of\ntheir net-of-TRIPRA and reinsurance accumulations. An increase\nin the deductible mid-term could potentially lead to a gap in\nterrorism reinsurance coverage, and consequently, could lead to\na failed stress test. If this were to occur, it may damage the\nfirm's financial strength rating, and impede its ability to\nsecure new business.\nIn 2017, nearly 800 U.S.-based carriers wrote $215 billion\nin TRIPRA-eligible premium, with a combined policyholder\nsurplus (PHS) of $733 billion.\nConsidering the current 20 percent deductible requirement\nand PHS as a filter, Guy Carpenter's analysis concludes that\nsmall- to mid-size insurers could be substantially more\nvulnerable to the annual increases in the TRIPRA industry\ntrigger and their overall net retentions as a percentage of PHS\n(see Table 1).\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nInsurers with $1 billion in surplus and relatively larger\nTRIPRA deductibles (over $200 million) tend to manage their\nconventional terrorism exposures and accumulations rather than\nbe dependent on TRIPRA recoveries.\nInsurers with less than $500 million in surplus and\nrelatively more exposure to terrorism losses are more likely to\nfall under the widening ``TRIPRA coverage gap'' that exposes\nthem to a loss scenario where TRIPRA may not be industry\ntriggered, leaving private reinsurance as their only source of\nsurplus protection.\nIt is not unforeseeable that changes to the backstop could\nresult in a withdrawal of smaller carriers away from the\nterrorism segment, while larger carriers may or may not\ncontinue to write--and absorb more--risk throughout the cycle\nof market dislocation. This would have an impact on the\nmarketplace with fewer options available for small businesses,\npotentially higher insurance expenses and less capital\navailable for growth and investments.\nIf changes are considered, we would recommend gradually\nphasing in any increases in the deductible over a planned time\nhorizon. This would mitigate short-term market disruptions and\nallow smaller companies time to adequately capitalize\nthemselves to take on an increased share within the private\nmarket.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SINEMA FROM TARIQUE\nNAGEER\nQ.1. What types of uncertainty will the insurance market and\ninsured entities experience if Congress waits too long to\nconsider reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act\n(TRIA)? How will that timing affect entities seeking coverage\nor renewal of coverage?\nA.1. The uncertainty around the future of the Terrorism Risk\nInsurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA)--scheduled to\nexpire on December 31, 2020--can significantly affect the\nproperty/casualty insurance industry.\nIf TRIPRA is not renewed by Congress, the property\ninsurance industry will be left with no Federal backstop for\nlosses from certified acts of terrorism. As policies with\neffective dates after December 31, 2019, may extend beyond the\nexpiration date of the legislation, insurers must determine in\nadvance how to deal with their terrorism exposures as of that\ndate.\nProperty insurers may either accept the terrorism liability\non all in-force policies on a fully net basis or place sunset\nclauses on policies written after December 31, 2020. Such a\nclause would cancel the terrorism coverage effective December\n31, 2020, if legislation extending TRIPRA is not passed by\nCongress and signed by the President.\nIn addition to property insurance, other coverage lines\nlikely will be impacted if TRIA expires or is significantly\nchanged, particularly workers' compensation insurance, as\nworkers' compensation insurers are not permitted to exclude\nterrorism from their policies. Insurers are concerned about\npotential aggregation of risk, which may impact the\navailability of workers' compensation insurance should TRIA\nmaterially change or expire. Where these insurers are also\noffering other lines of insurance, such as property, the\ncombined aggregate exposure likely will further limit their\nability or willingness to offer substantial property limits.\nLikely impacts that the absence of or a serious\nmodification of TRIA could have on the workers' compensation\nmarket are in the areas of pricing and capacity. It is expected\nthat the reinsurance market would likely increase pricing\nbecause of the increased potential exposure. This would, in\nturn, have a trickle-down effect on the primary workers'\ncompensation marketplace. Further, the ability of insurers to\nuse reinsurance capacity to manage their maximum tolerable\nlosses could prove more difficult, especially for the terrorism\nperils of NBCR events. This could significantly alter carriers'\nrisk appetites and their willingness to offer coverage to\nemployers with large employee accumulations.\nQ.2. Should a lapse in terrorism coverage provided by TRIA\noccur, what effects do you foresee on the availability and\npricing of said coverage?\nA.2. If Congress does not extend or renew TRIPRA, the market\ndynamics for terrorism insurance will be further disrupted and\nmay result in increased pricing as capacity shrinks.\nIn the absence of a federally mandated offer of TRIA\nterrorism coverage, there remains the strong likelihood that\ninsurance and capital markets will choose not to offer\nterrorism coverage--using the premise that there is a higher\ncertainty of returns elsewhere.\nTRIA's expiration or substantial modification at extension\nwill\nalmost certainly affect embedded TRIA coverage, standalone\nterrorism pricing/demand for capacity and TRIA captive\nprograms. Terrorism insurance capacity may be difficult to\nacquire at reasonable cost for insureds with significant\nexposures in a central business district of a major (Tier 1)\ncity, or if the properties are\nperceived as potential targets for terrorism attacks, and/or\nwhere there have been instances of foiled plots.\nThe main alternative for a property terrorism risk transfer\nmechanism if TRIA is not reauthorized would be the standalone\nterrorism insurance market. As standalone capacity is finite,\nthe cost of this capacity likely would be considerably higher\nin areas or cities where demand is high, such as major\nmetropolitan areas,\ncentral business districts, iconic buildings, ports/airports,\nand even ``soft targets'' such as shopping malls.\nThis market dynamic varies considerably by location. In\ncertain high-risk cities--such as New York, San Francisco,\nChicago, Houston, Atlanta or Washington, D.C.--the cost of\nstandalone terrorism insurance capacity can be multiples of the\ncurrent pricing for TRIA embedded as part of property programs.\nOrganizations that employ captives also are likely to be\naffected in the event TRIA is allowed to expire or is\nsignificantly changed. Captives are widely used to supplement\nwhat is available in the commercial market, and, in some cases\ncaptive insurers are the only available option for certain\nlayers and/or perils. This is most common in areas of higher\nperceived risk, such as for property or employee-related\ncoverages in major cities. Generally speaking, since captives\nare best suited to primary operating layers, or as a mechanism\nfor accessing risk transfer solutions, it is very likely that,\nabsent TRIA, captive utilization for terrorism coverage would\nchange significantly.\nQ.3. In December 2016, the Department of the Treasury issued\nguidance which clarified that losses from cyber-terrorist\nattacks were to be treated the same as commercial property and\ncasualty losses. Do you think this guidance sufficiently covers\nall forms of cyber attacks?\nA.3. The December 2016 guidance from the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury addressed a unique issue related to TRIA's coverage of\ncyber perils.\nA core insuring agreement for cyber insurance is data asset\nrestoration. When malware encrypts, corrupts or destroys data,\na cyber insurance policy can reimburse the cost to restore or\nrecreate that data. This coverage may also include\nreimbursement for the cost of replacing servers, devices or\nother components that have been corrupted beyond repair, often\nreferred to as ``bricking.'' In addition to this coverage being\navailable in the cyber insurance market, some property carriers\nmay also offer this coverage. Other carriers, however, may\nexclude this coverage because the loss does not result from a\nphysical event, such as fire or explosion.\nPrior to December 2016, Treasury was silent on whether\ncyber insurance should be included or excluded from TRIA. As a\nresult, if a quickly replicating, data destroying malware\ncreated a widespread data corruption event and corresponding\nloss of revenue from business interruption, such as NotPetya,\nTRIA may have responded differently to losses under property\ninsurance policies and cyber insurance policies, even though\nthey responded to the same losses from the same peril.\nAccordingly, Treasury's guidance clarified that losses from\ncyber-terrorist attacks that were subject to the coverage of\ncyber insurance policies were to be treated the same as\ncommercial property and casualty losses.\nQ.4. How do insurers effectively measure and quantify loss from\ncyber attacks?\nA.4. One of Marsh's services as a trusted cyber-risk adviser is\nto help quantify the potential impact of a cyber attack and to\nhelp clients establish controls for ongoing assessment of cyber\nrisk. In some instances, such as data breaches, this can be\nbased on modeling from prior claims activity. In other\ninstances, such as losses from loss of revenues and extra\nexpense from malware events, the lack of claims history may\nrequire alternative means of quantification that involves\nassessment of clients' cyber assets, review of the client's\nprocess and procedures for protecting assets and proposing\nscenarios that could lead to large loss. With collaborative\nengagements by Marsh brokers and consultants, Marsh offers\nclients the opportunity to dispel the uncertainty of their\ncyber exposures and devote adequate resources with optimal\nresults.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR MENENDEZ FROM HOWARD\nKUNREUTHER\nQ.1. TRIA reauthorization is particularly important to my home\nState of New Jersey, where there is a high population density,\nimportant cultural centers and landmarks, and major\ninfrastructure, including ports, rail, and highways.\nWhat are the consequences of letting TRIA expire for high\ntarget States like New Jersey?\nA.1. The consequences of letting TRIA expire for high target\nStates like New Jersey could be highly significant because many\nprivate insurers will likely refuse to offer coverage against\nterrorism losses to commercial firms because of a concern with\nthe consequences of a catastrophic loss to their operations.\nThose insurers considering offering coverage will very likely\ncharge much higher premiums than if they are protected by TRIA.\nThe likelihood of a cyber-terrorist attack and its consequences\nare highly ambiguous so they will focus on worst case scenarios\nin specifying the price of terrorism coverage.\nQ.2. What are consequences of letting TRIA expire for\ncommunities around the country that are home to critical\ninfrastructure such as rail lines, power plants, highways,\nairports, or pipelines? If these investments become more\ncostly, doesn't that have a nationally adverse impact?\nA.2. If TRIA expires and critical infrastructure is uninsured\nand suffers a severe loss from a terrorist attack, this would\nhave a\nnationally adverse impact. The President might issue a disaster\ndeclaration so that Federal assistance could be provided.\nIncluding infrastructure losses as part of TRIA could encourage\ninvestments now in mitigating future losses through long-term\nloans and premium reductions, as noted in my testimony.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR WARREN FROM HOWARD\nKUNREUTHER\nQ.1. Certain mass shootings, such as those that occurred in Las\nVegas, NV, Sutherland Springs, TX, and Newtown, CT, have not\nbeen certified by the Treasury Secretary as acts of terrorism.\nTherefore, these incidents have not been regarded as qualifying\nevents for terrorism risk insurance, in part, because those\nattacks did not meet current law's requirement of being ``part\nof an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United\nStates or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the\nUnited States Government by coercion.'' Given the high\nfrequency of mass shootings in the United States, is there a\npublic policy interest in certifying certain mass shootings\ncommitted by individuals as qualifying events for terrorism\nrisk insurance purposes, even if they are not demonstrably\nintended to coerce Americans or influence U.S. Government\npolicy? Please explain why or why not.\nA.1. To address this important issue, the Department of the\nTreasury needs to interact with private insurers to determine\nwhether insurers now provide protection against mass shootings\nthat may not be caused by terrorists. If there is sufficient\nprivate insurance coverage then it may not be necessary to\ninclude these events under TRIA. If there is limited coverage\nagainst mass shootings, then it will be important to determine\nwho pays for the losses from these events and whether a case\ncan be made to consider including these events under TRIA when\nit is considered for renewal in 2020.\nQ.2. According to Congressional Research Service (CRS)\nspecialist Baird Webel's written testimony, the current\nterrorism risk insurance program ``protect[s] consumers--by\nrequiring insurers that offer [Terrorism Risk Insurance Act]-\ncovered lines of insurance to make terrorism insurance\navailable prospectively to their commercial policyholders.''\nAre there other actions that Congress or Federal agencies could\ntake that would enhance protections for consumers in the\nterrorism risk insurance market?\nA.2. No response provided.\nQ.3. According to CRS specialist Baird Webel's written\ntestimony, ``Federal law does not limit what insurers can\ncharge for terrorism risk insurance, although State regulators\ntypically have the authority under State law to modify\nexcessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory rates.''\nWhile one of the original goals of the Terrorism Risk Insurance\nProgram is to preserve State regulation of insurance, is there\na public policy interest in developing a Federal limit on what\ninsurers can charge for terrorism risk insurance, or is the\ncurrent State-centric framework sufficient to prevent abusive\npractices in the market?\nA.3. I feel that insurers should be able to charge premiums\nthat reflect their risks, so State regulators should not\nrestrict the premiums insurers can charge. It will be important\nfor State regulators to make sure that the premiums are high\nenough so that the insurers has a low chance of insolvency if\nit suffers a catastrophic loss. One of the important reasons\nfor renewing TRIA is to provide a Federal backstop if insurers'\ntotal losses exceed a certain amount. In my testimony I\nindicated that the Wharton Risk Center's study revealed that\ntotal insured losses from a terrorist attack would have to\nexceed $60 billion before the Federal Government would be\nresponsible for covering any insured losses.\nQ.4. On December 27, 2016, the Treasury Department issued\n``guidance regarding how insurance recently classified as\n`Cyber Liability' for purposes of reporting premiums and losses\nto State insurance regulators will be treated under TRIA and\nTreasury's regulations for the Program (Program regulations).''\nThat guidance ``confirms that stand-alone cyber insurance\npolicies reported under the `Cyber Liability' line are included\nin the definition of `property and casualty insurance' under\nTRIA and are thus subject to the disclosure requirements and\nother requirements in TRIA and the Program regulations[.]\nFurthermore, that guidance noted, ``Cyber risk insurance\nremains an evolving insurance market, both in terms of product\ndevelopment and regulatory oversight.'' Similarly, cyberspace\nremains a consistently evolving threat environment. At this\ntime, would you recommend any updates to the Treasury\nDepartment's guidance on cyber insurance policies? Please\nexplain why or why not.\nA.4. In my testimony I noted that cyberterrorism is an\ninterdependent risk where compromising one computer network can\ncause losses to many others in the interconnected system. The\nexistence of such interdependencies provides challenges to\ninsurers in determining whether to offer protection against\nthis risk in their terrorism coverage and if so what premium to\ncharge. For this reason I feel that it is important that the\nDepartment of the Treasury interact with private insurers to\ndetermine whether cyberterrorism should be included under the\nTRIA backstop. By including it in TRIA both private insurers\nand the Federal Government would form a private-public\npartnership to deal with a risk where the likelihood of a\ncyber-terrorist attack and its consequences are highly\nambiguous. With a backstop from the Federal Government if the\nlosses from a cyber terrorist were extremely large, insurers\nwould feel more comfortable insuring this risk and would\nconsider charging a lower premium than if they were fully\nresponsible for a catastrophic loss.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR JONES FROM HOWARD\nKUNREUTHER\nQ.1. Cyber attacks are gaining traction as a preferred method\nto terrorize individuals and organizations. In 2016, the\nTreasury Department issued guidance that clarified\ncyberterrorism is included in TRIA.\nSome believe that Russia interference in the 2016\nPresidential election by manipulating voters with fake social\nmedia accounts is considered cyberterrorism. This type of\ncyberterrorism has immeasurable consequences and effects\nAmericans that would not even participate in TRIA.\nAdditionally, the Port of Mobile keeps track of containers\nthat are to be shipped across the country. The Port of Mobile\nis an important part of Alabama's economy. If an organization\ndecided to pressure Alabama into particular policy positions by\nattacking their computer system it would have dramatic effects\non business owners dependent on the Port to ship their\nmerchandise.\nWhat cyberterrorism looks like and the effects on people is\nvery different from physical terrorist attacks. How should TRIA\nadapt to the growing prevalence of cyber attacks that gives\nprivate insurance a backstop but also provides policy holders\nwith protection?\nA.1. In my testimony I noted that cyberterrorism is an\ninterdependent risk, where compromising one computer network\ncan cause losses to many others in the interconnected system.\nThe existence of such interdependencies provides challenges to\ninsurers in determining whether to offer protection against\nthis risk in their terrorism coverage and, if so, what premium\nto charge. For this reason I feel that it is important that the\nDepartment of the\nTreasury interact with private insurers to determine whether\ncyberterrorism should be included under the TRIA backstop. By\nincluding it in TRIA, both private insurers and the Federal\nGovernment would form a private-public partnership to deal with\na risk where the likelihood of a cyber-terrorist attack and its\nconsequences are highly ambiguous. With a backstop from the\nFederal Government, if the losses from a cyber terrorist were\nextremely large, insurers would feel more comfortable insuring\nthis risk and would consider charging a lower premium than if\nthey were fully responsible for a catastrophic loss.\nQ.2. Often TRIA is discussed with large cities in mind, but\nmany smaller communities can be targets of terrorist\nactivities. This is shown with the Charleston, South Carolina,\nchurch shooting when a white supremacist murdered nine people.\nSmall communities like this are likely to receive insurance\nfrom local agents.\nAlso, Alabama is home to two extremely popular football\nteams, University of Alabama and Auburn University. The Iron\nBowl is an annual game between Alabama and Auburn and draws\nlarge crowds from each school. This could easily be a target\nfor terrorist organizations.\nHow would reforms to TRIA affect smaller communities,\nparticularly their premiums and the extent of their coverage?\nA.2. In setting premiums for terrorist coverage, insurers are\nconcerned with the size of the program trigger for TRIA. In\n2020 if a terrorist attack creates insured losses less than\n$200 million, then TRIA will not be triggered. In this case\nthere will be no Federal backstop. If insurers are concerned\nwith having to be responsible for the total losses from mass\nshootings or a terrorist attack in a small community, they are\nlikely to charge higher premiums and reduce their coverage.\nSome insurers may decide not to provide protection against mass\nshootings or to firms in smaller communities from losses from a\nterrorist attack. In considering the\nrenewal of TRIA, consideration should be given to the size of\nthe program trigger and whether losses from mass shootings from\nterrorists should be covered by TRIA even if the total insured\nlosses were lower than the TRIA program trigger. If losses from\nmass shootings would be covered by TRIA, insurers are likely to\ncharge lower premiums and provide more coverage against these\nterrorist-related disasters.\n------\nRESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION OF SENATOR SINEMA FROM HOWARD\nKUNREUTHER\nQ.1.

If these investments become more\ncostly, doesn't that have a nationally adverse impact?\nA.1. TRIA acts to lower the cost of terrorism insurance in two\nprimary ways. (1) It directly subsidizes terrorism insurance by\nproviding reinsurance coverage for no upfront premiums; and (2)\nit expands the supply of terrorism insurance through the\nrequirement that companies offer terrorism insurance to\ncommercial policyholders. TRIA expiration would remove both the\ndirect subsidy and the extra supply from the market and thus\nwould likely raise the cost of terrorism insurance. The impact\nof this would be felt to the greatest extent in high target\nStates as insurers would likely seek to reduce their overall\nexposure to such States. In addition, it would be in such\nStates that lenders would be most likely to require terrorism\ncoverage before providing loans for large commercial real\nestate projects. A similar dynamic would also come into play\nwith critical infrastructure, thus raising costs for such\nprojects and potentially having a nationally adverse impact as\ncritical infrastructure is necessary for the economy\nnationwide. If TRIA were to expire, however, Congress might\nalso consider redirecting the resources that are devoted to\nTRIA to some other use that could support critical\ninfrastructure.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR WARREN FROM BAIRD\nWEBEL\nQ.1. Certain mass shootings, such as those that occurred in Las\nVegas, NV, Sutherland Springs, TX, and Newtown, CT, have not\nbeen certified by the Treasury Secretary as acts of terrorism.\nTherefore, these incidents have not been regarded as qualifying\nevents for terrorism risk insurance, in part, because those\nattacks did not meet current law's requirement of being ``part\nof an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United\nStates or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the\nU.S. Government by coercion.'' Given the high frequency of mass\nshootings in the United States, is there a public policy\ninterest in certifying certain mass shootings committed by\nindividuals as qualifying events for terrorism risk insurance\npurposes, even if they are not demonstrably intended to coerce\nAmericans or influence U.S. Government policy? Please explain\nwhy or why not.\nA.1. TRIA requires the following for certification of a\nterrorist attack under the statute. An act must:\n(i)   to be an act of terrorism;\n(ii)  to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to----\n(I)    human life;\n(II)   property; or\n(III)   infrastructure;\n(iii)  to have resulted in damage within the United States,\nor outside of the United States in the case of----\n(I)   an air carrier or vessel described in paragraph\n(5)(B); or\n(II)   the premises of a United States mission; and\n(iv)  to have been committed by an individual or individuals,\nas part of an effort to coerce the civilian population\nof the United States or to influence the policy or\naffect the conduct of the U.S. Government by coercion.\nIn addition, the statute requires that the act of terrorism\ncause more than $5 million in aggregate property casualty\ninsurance losses in order to be certified. Losses incurred for\nin health or life insurance are not covered under TRIA.\nThe certification of an event as an act of terrorism under\nTRIA serves a relatively narrow statutory purpose. It solely\nrelates to potential sharing of insured losses by the Federal\nGovernment and is not referenced in other national security or\njudicial statutes. In past experience, particularly following\nthe 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, the President in a statement\nidentified an attack as an act of terror, but the relatively\nlow level of insured property casualty losses meant that, under\nthe TRIA criteria, it could not be certified regardless of the\nmotives involved. Due to the precise nature of terrorism\nexclusions in insurance policies covering some of the Boston\nbusinesses who suffered losses due to the bombing, TRIA\ncertification in that case would likely have resulted in\ncoverage gaps and less payments to insureds.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ See, for example, ``Mass. Regulator on Boston Bombing Claims,\nTRIA Reauthorization Effort,'' Insurance Journal, April 23, 2014, at\nhttps://www.insurancejournal.com/news/east/2014/04/23/327033.htm; and\n``Insurance Payout May Depend on Whether Boston Bombing Was `Terrorist\nAct,' '' ABC News, at https://abcnews.go.com/Business/boston-firms-\nwait-terrorism-certification-insurance-payout/story?id=19043385.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMany mass shooting events may fall into a similar category\nas the Marathon bombing. While they may inflict a tragic toll\non the life and health of those involved, mass shootings may\nnot cause losses in commercial property casualty insurance\nsufficient to meet the TRIA criteria for certification. In such\ncases, only addressing the TRIA criteria with regard to motives\nmay have relatively little effect on potential certification of\nmass shootings as terrorist events under TRIA. In addition,\ncertification is only the first threshold that must be crossed\nbefore the Government would share losses under TRIA. The\ncombination of the program trigger and the insurer deductible\nmake it unlikely that the certification of most mass shootings\nas eligible for coverage under TRIA would result in any actual\nloss sharing.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\2\\ For example, recent press reports suggest approximately $750\nmillion in insured damages for the Las Vegas shooting (``MGM Sees $800\nMillion Las Vegas Shooting Settlement; $751 Million Covered by\nInsurance,'' Insurance Journal, May 20, 2019). The primary insurer\nreported was Zurich American Insurance (``MGM Resorts Sues Zurich\nAmerican Insurance for Las Vegas Shooting Defense Costs,'' Insurance\nJournal, June 24, 2019). According to data supplied to CRS by the\nTreasury Department, Zurich's TRIA insurer deductible would be\napproximately $1.4 billion. Thus, if the press reports are accurate,\neven if the Las Vegas shooting were certified, no Federal loss sharing\nwould occur.\nQ.2. According to Congressional Research Service (CRS)\nspecialist Baird Webel's written testimony, the current\nterrorism risk insurance program ``protect[s] consumers--by\nrequiring insurers that offer [Terrorism Risk Insurance Act]-\ncovered lines of insurance to make terrorism insurance\navailable prospectively to their commercial policyholders.''\nAre there other actions that Congress or Federal agencies could\ntake that would enhance protections for consumers in the\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nterrorism risk insurance market?\nA.2. Beyond the ``make available'' provisions TRIA effectively\nleaves terrorism insurance consumer protection issues (such as\naffordability of terrorism insurance or the precise details of\nterrorism insurance policies) to the State insurance regulators\nas is the case in commercial insurance generally. This primacy\nof State insurance regulation is codified in the 1945 McCarran-\nFerguson Act.\\3\\ It is possible for Congress to revisit this\naspect of McCarran-Ferguson with regard to terrorism insurance,\nas was done to a degree in the original 2002 TRIA, which also\nnullified terrorism exclusions that previously had been\napproved by State insurance regulators at the time. Such\nincreased Federal oversight of terrorism insurance, however,\nwould require specific statutory change as the Federal agencies\nwho might provide such oversight, including the Department of\nthe Treasury, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the\nFederal Trade Commission, currently have little or no authority\nto oversee insurance.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\3\\ Codified at 15 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  1011-1015.\nQ.3. According to CRS specialist Baird Webel's written\ntestimony, ``Federal law does not limit what insurers can\ncharge for terrorism risk insurance, although State regulators\ntypically have the authority under State law to modify\nexcessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory rates.''\nWhile one of the original goals of the Terrorism Risk Insurance\nProgram is to preserve State regulation of insurance, is there\na public policy interest in developing a Federal limit on what\ninsurers can charge for terrorism risk insurance, or is the\ncurrent State-centric framework sufficient to prevent abusive\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\npractices in the market?\nA.3. The State regulatory system generally treats commercial\ninsurance lines, such as those covered under TRIA, to less\ndirect oversight on consumer protection grounds than personal\nlines, such as homeowners insurance or automobile insurance.\nThis is typically justified on the grounds that the businesses\npurchasing commercial lines are seen as sophisticated consumers\nwho are better able to understand insurance contracts and seek\nout the best prices.\\4\\ Thus, for example, there is little\ndirect rate regulation in commercial insurance compared to\npersonal insurance where some States require prior approval of\nrate changes, or have after-the-fact approval processes.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\4\\ Similar theories are present in financial regulation under\nFederal law, such as the concept of an ``accredited investor'' used by\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission. See CRS Report IF11278,\n``Accredited Investor Definition and Private Securities Markets,'' by\nEva Su.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRecent Treasury and private data on terrorism insurance\npricing has generally been interpreted as signaling no\nsignificant problems in the market; and CRS is unaware of any\nState departments of insurance taking public action against\ninsurers for excessive rates on terrorism insurance. Overall\naverage rates can, however, mask individual markets that may be\nfacing difficulties. It is within Congress' purview to\ninvestigate complaints of excessive rates and enact changes\naddressing any issues found. Since Congress has found the\navailability of terrorism insurance important enough on public\npolicy grounds to create and extend the TRIA program, this\nmight also be sufficient grounds to justify additional Federal\nattention to the affordability of terrorism insurance.\nQ.4. On December 27, 2016, the Treasury Department issued\n``guidance regarding how insurance recently classified as\n`Cyber Liability' for purposes of reporting premiums and losses\nto State insurance regulators will be treated under TRIA and\nTreasury's regulations for the Program (Program regulations).''\nThat guidance ``confirms that stand-alone cyber insurance\npolicies reported under the `Cyber Liability' line are included\nin the definition of `property and casualty insurance' under\nTRIA and are thus subject to the disclosure requirements and\nother requirements in TRIA and the Program regulations[.]\nFurthermore, that guidance noted, ``Cyber risk insurance\nremains an evolving insurance market, both in terms of product\ndevelopment and regulatory oversight.'' Similarly, cyberspace\nremains a consistently evolving threat environment. At this\ntime, would you recommend any updates to the Treasury\nDepartment's guidance on cyber insurance policies? Please\nexplain why or why not.\nA.4. The years since the Treasury guidance have not\nsubstantially altered the evolving and uncertain nature of\ncyber insurance. The combined public-private nature of TRIA,\nhowever, provides significant space for private insurers to\ninnovate in the coverages offered for cyber risk while still\nremaining under the reinsurance backstop provided by TRIA.\nTreasury's guidance seems clear that policies in the new cyber\nliability line of insurance are eligible for TRIA coverage.\nThis does not mean, however, that there might not be future\nissues relating to TRIA coverage in the case of a cyber-\nterrorist attack. For example, if the exact perpetrators are\nunknown, it may be difficult for Treasury to certify the attack\nunder the criteria contained in the TRIA statute. It is also\npossible that a substantial attack might occur but be under the\nvarious thresholds in the law that limit Federal sharing of\nterrorism losses. Addressing such issues, however, would be\nbeyond Treasury's authority to address in guidance and would\ninstead require amendments by Congress to the underlying\nstatute.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR JONES FROM BAIRD\nWEBEL\nQ.1. Cyber attacks are gaining traction as a preferred method\nto terrorize individuals and organizations. In 2016, the\nTreasury Department issued guidance that clarified\ncyberterrorism is included in TRIA.\nSome believe that Russia interference in the 2016\nPresidential election by manipulating voters with fake social\nmedia accounts is considered cyberterrorism. This type of\ncyberterrorism has immeasurable consequences and effects\nAmericans that would not even participate in TRIA.\nAdditionally, the Port of Mobile keeps track of containers\nthat are to be shipped across the country. The Port of Mobile\nis an important part of Alabama's economy. If an organization\ndecided to pressure Alabama into particular policy positions by\nattacking their computer system it would have dramatic effects\non business owners dependent on the Port to ship their\nmerchandise.\nWhat cyberterrorism looks like and the effects on people is\nvery different from physical terrorist attacks. How should TRIA\nadapt to the growing prevalence of cyber attacks that gives\nprivate insurance a backstop but also provides policy holders\nwith protection?\nA.1. While TRIA does not directly address cyberterrorism, the\nflexibility inherent in the combined public/private nature of\nthe program has allowed cyberterrorism to be covered by TRIA\nwithout specific statutory changes. As long as private\ninsurance policies are covering cyberterrorism, TRIA will as\nwell even if the effects of a cyber-terrorist attack may be\nsubstantially different than other forms of terrorism. The\npurchase of cyber insurance by businesses is growing, however\nit may not be reaching coverage levels that would be considered\noptimal from a public policy perspective. For example, higher\ncoverage levels could be desired since insurance often serves\nto mitigate damage through mechanisms like information sharing\non best practices.\nThere are some aspects of the TRIA design that may not be\noptimal if the desire is to promote the purchase of cyber\ninsurance and ensure that TRIA provides coverage for a\nterrorist attack via cyberspace. For example, the program\ntrigger, currently at $180 million and set to go to $200\nmillion, and the 20 percent insurer deductible are high enough\nthat the insured loss levels from many cyber attacks may not\ncross the thresholds and result in TRIA loss sharing. In\naddition, the definition of an act of terrorism in the statute\nrequires than an act be ``committed by an individual or\nindividuals, as part of an effort to coerce the civilian\npopulation of the United States or to influence the policy or\naffect the conduct of the U.S. Government by coercion.'' In the\ncase of a cyber attack, however, it may be difficult to even\nidentify perpetrators, let alone define what their intent might\nbe.\nQ.2. Often TRIA is discussed with large cities in mind, but\nmany smaller communities can be targets of terrorist\nactivities. This is shown with the Charleston, South Carolina,\nchurch shooting when a white supremacist murdered nine people.\nSmall communities like this are likely to receive insurance\nfrom local agents.\nAlso, Alabama is home to two extremely popular football\nteams, University of Alabama and Auburn University. The Iron\nBowl is an annual game between Alabama and Auburn and draws\nlarge crowds from each school. This could easily be a target\nfor terrorist organizations.\nHow would reforms to TRIA affect smaller communities,\nparticularly their premiums and the extent of their coverage?\nA.2. The TRIA program does not contain differential application\nprocesses or metrics for different-sized communities. However,\nthe thresholds in the Act (i.e., the program trigger, the\ninsurer deductible, and the $5 million loss threshold for\ncertification) may have a differential effect simply due to the\ncost differences between larger and smaller cities. For\nexample, an identical building is much more expensive to build\nin Manhattan than Mobile, thus, an otherwise identical\nterrorist attack will likely cause lower insured damages and be\nless likely to clear the thresholds for TRIA coverage. Thus, if\nthe TRIA dollar thresholds are raised, this would have in\nrelative terms, a larger effect on these less expensive\ncommunities as TRIA coverage would be less likely to be\ntriggered. In practical terms, however, the impact on premiums\nwill be somewhat reduced as the overall cost of insurance in\nsuch communities is lower and the risk of a terrorist attack,\nand thus the premiums for terrorism insurance, is seen as\nlower.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SINEMA FROM BAIRD\nWEBEL\nQ.1. In December 2016, the Department of the Treasury issued\nguidance which clarified that losses from cyber-terrorist\nattacks were to be treated the same as commercial property and\ncasualty losses. Do you think this guidance sufficiently covers\nall forms of cyber attacks?\nA.1. The Treasury guidance does not overrule the statutory\nlanguage that is in place, particularly the exemption of\nspecific lines of insurance from the TRIA program. In 2016, the\nState insurance regulators introduced a new cyber liability\nline of insurance for regulatory purposes. Prior to this,\npolicies covering cyber risk were reported in different lines\nof insurance, including in some cases lines of insurance that\nwere specifically exempted from TRIA. This new cyber liability\nline of insurance largely prompted the Treasury guidance. It is\nnot clear whether some of the coverage for cyber risk is still\nbeing covered under an exempted line, but to the extent that\ndamage from a cyber attack still is covered under these\nexempted lines, TRIA would not cover such an attack. This may\nvery well have less of an impact over time as more future cyber\ncoverage likely will be provided under the cyber-specific line\nof insurance that is being covered under TRIA.\nThe guidance also does not affect all of the other\nstatutory aspects of the program, such as the certification\nrequirements and the various monetary thresholds. To the extent\nthat a cyber-terrorist attack might interact differently with\nthese statutory requirements compared to a noncyber attack,\\1\\\nTreasury would be limited in its ability to provide coverage\nunder TRIA for such an attack as any guidance cannot contradict\nthe statute upon which it is based.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ For example, it seems more likely that a cyber attack might be\ncarried out without immediate attribution to the perpetrating party,\nthus making it difficult to discern the motive that is necessary for\ncertification.\nQ.2. How do insurers effectively measure and quantify loss from\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\ncyber attacks?\nA.2. Measuring and quantifying loss from cyber attacks is\ndifficult and the insurance coverage for such attacks is still\nimmature compared to more established lines of insurance where\nthe industry might have decades, or even centuries, of data to\ndraw upon. The insurance rating agency AM Best describes the\nsituation as follows:\nCyber risk modeling is still in its infancy, as events\nand threat vectors are still evolving. To simulate the\nevent sets and fit them into traditional statistical\ndistribution forms is the first challenge. Cataloging\nthe exposure in an insurer's portfolio to these events\nand how the losses vary depending on the severity of\nthe attack and estimating the financial damage are all\ncomplicated problems that cyber modeling firms are\ntackling. These models are improving and may provide\ndirectional input into relative rankings of risk but\nneed to be complimented with stress testing and\nanalytical, experience-based judgment for pricing,\ncapital consumption, and allocation.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\2\\ AM Best, ``Cyber Insurers Are Profitable Today, but Wary of\nTomorrow's Risks,'' June 17, 2019, p. 11.\nA frequent insurer response to the uncertainty reportedly has\nbeen to use certain policy provisions, such as exclusions and\nlimits as well as reinsurance purchases to reduce exposure to\nlarge losses.\\3\\ Policy provisions such as exclusions and\nlimits tend to reduce the utility of cyber insurance to\nconsumers and may lead to consumer confusion.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\3\\ See ``Data Deficit Remains Key Challenge for Cyber Insurance\nUnderwriters,'' Insurance Journal, June 18, 2019, at https://\nwww.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2019/06/18/529663.htm.\n\\4\\ See ``Businesses Believe Cyber Insurance Covers More Than It\nDoes: Survey,'' Insurance Journal, July 31, 2019, at https://\nwww.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2019/07/31/534394.htm.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional Material Supplied for the Record\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]",

Marco Rubio,\nChairman of the Committee, presiding.\nPresent: Senators Rubio, Risch, Scott, Ernst, Young,\nRomney, Hawley, Cardin, Cantwell, and Hirono.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARCO RUBIO, CHAIRMAN, A U.S. SENATOR\nFROM FLORIDA\nChairman Rubio. Today's hearing on the Senate Committee on\nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship will come to order. Thank\nyou for your patience. We have six votes and we made a wise\ndecision, I believe, the Ranking Member and I, that it would be\nbetter to just ride through the six than to try to do the back-\nand-forth, and I think we probably saved time in the long run.\nSo I want to thank you for being here and for your patience.\nFor small businesses and entrepreneurs around the country,\nsecuring a contract with the Federal Government can mean\ninstant growth in the marketplace. In 2018, the Federal\nGovernment obligated $560 billion in contracts for goods,\nservices, research, and development. More than $100 billion of\nthat total went to small business contractors.\nThe Contracting Office at the SBA administers several\ntargeted programs, authorized by Congress, that seeks to help\nentrepreneurs access these procurement opportunities with the\nFederal Government, a Federal Government, by the way, which is\nrequired to spend 23 percent of all Federal contracting dollars\nwith small businesses.\nThe four primary programs which are the focus of today's\nhearing provide participants with access to compete within a\nsmaller pool of contracts that are set aside for small\nbusinesses. The first, the Small Business and Capital Ownership\nDevelopment Program, which is commonly referred to as 8(a)\nbecause of its location within the Small Business Act, also\nprovides small businesses with procurement training, technical\nassistance, and the ability to be paired with a mentor\nbusiness.\nIn addition to the classic small businesses that\nparticipate in this program, for up to nine years before they\ngraduate out, 8(a) also gives businesses that are communally\nowned, by Alaska Native corporations, Native Hawaiian\norganizations, Indian tribes, or community development\ncorporations the ability to participate in the program\nindefinitely.\nThe Historically Underutilized Business Zone program, or\nHUBZone, which works to stimulate economic development and\ncreate jobs in the areas of the country that need it the most,\nwas created in 1997. The program uses set-aside contracts and a\nprice preference to bring opportunity to distressed inner\ncities and rural communities where joblessness is often\nrampant.\nThe Women-Owned Small Business Program and Service-Disabled\nVeteran-Owned Small Business Program give two very important\nsmall business groups the chance to compete for set-aside\ncontracts.\nIn addition to the government-wide goal of awarding 23\npercent of contracts to small businesses, Congress has set\ngoals of 5 percent each for 8(a) and women-owned businesses,\nand 3 percent for service-disabled veteran-owned small\nbusinesses and HUBZone-certified businesses.\nThe Federal Government, by the way, could easily exceed\nthese goals if small businesses were given more guidance on the\ndifficult and complex world of Federal procurement, and if\nagency contracting specialists were better informed on how to\nmake compliant set-aside and sole-source awards to small\nbusinesses.\nUnfortunately, as a result of fraud across the board in the\nSBA programs, as reported from multiple government\naccountability office investigations, businesses that do not\nqualify, or should not be qualifying for these specific\ncategory programs are often taking the contracts that are\nintended for these groups.\nFor example, a 2018 audit by the Office of Inspector\nGeneral looked at 56 sole-source awards made to firms in the\nWomen-Owned Small Business Program and it found that 18\ncontracts, valued at $11.7 million, were awarded to firms that\nhad no documentation; 32 contracts, valued at $40.5 million,\nwere awarded to firms with incomplete documentation; and 50\ncontracts, valued at $52.2 million, were not awarded in\ncompliance with Federal regulations. The 2019 GAO study of this\nprogram showed that the SBA still had not developed a process\nto identify when ineligible awards were made under this\nprogram.\nToo many agency contracting officers also do not know how\nto work with the contracting programs. A 2018 GAO study found\nthe SBA's procurement scorecard to assess agency compliance\nwith small business contracting was not effectively measuring\nagency performance or promoting opportunities for small\nbusinesses.\nThe facts are simple. The small businesses' contracting\ngoals are aspirational and unenforceable, so if we do not make\ncontracting with small businesses easy for Federal agencies it\nis not going to happen. The SBA should be an ally for small\nbusiness contractors, not an additional and frustrating hurdle\nto overcome. The disparities amongst the prime contracting\nprograms have made it difficult for small businesses to even\nknow where to start. Each program is an entirely different\nsystem, even for the initial certification process, not to\nmention the different forms of training, types of awards, award\namounts, price preferences that are made available to each\ngroup.\nIn 2015, Congress passed a law requiring that the SBA set\nup a certification process for the then self-certified Women-\nOwned Small Business Program. Unfortunately, four years later,\nthe SBA has yet to comply with that law. In 2018, Congress\npassed a law to measure a business revenue for five years,\ninstead of three, when determining if that business is small\nand if they can compete for set-aside contracts. But the SBA\nhas frankly refused to comply with that law.\nWhile the prime contracting programs are the most well-\nknown parts of the SBA Contracting Office, the subcontracting\nprogram is increasingly important, as the government moves\ntowards consolidated purchasing and larger, multi-award\ncontracts.\nIt is important that we find ways for small businesses to\ncontinue to work with the government, even as the government is\nchanging its purchasing habits to rightfully use taxpayer money\nmore efficiently. Innovations and unique solutions from small\nbusinesses in the private sector help to support our soldiers,\nprotect our national security, enhance government operations,\nand make the Federal bureaucracy more efficient.\nTo keep this contracting cycle going we must reduce fraud,\nstreamlining the Contracting Office at the SBA, and provide\nmore opportunities for small businesses to grow and prosper,\nand I look forward to discussing ways to accomplish these goals\ntoday.\nWith that I turn it over to you, the Ranking Member.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN, RANKING MEMBER, A\nU.S. SENATOR FROM MARYLAND\nSenator Cardin. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman,\nand I thank you for convening this hearing. This is our sixth\nhearing on the reauthorization of the Small Business Act, and\ntoday we will focus on the contracting programs with SBA that\nhelp level the playing field for starkly disadvantaged business\nowners. These programs include the 8(a) Business Development\nProgram, the Women-Owned Small Business Program, Service-\nDisabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Program, and the\nHistorically Underutilized Business Zones, HUBZones, program.\nThe motivation behind my commitment to ensuring a fair\nFederal contracting process is twofold. First, the Federal\nGovernment is the largest consumer of goods and services on the\nplanet, and Federal contracting is a vital part of the economy\nin my home State of Maryland. In fact, Federal Government\ncontracting spending accounts for about 8 percent of Maryland's\nannual GDP, and supports thousands of jobs that help the\nfamilies and bolster the middle class.\nSecond, Congress passed the Small Business Act to ensure\nthe preservation and expansion of opportunities for small\nbusinesses because doing so is basic not only to the economic\nwell-being but the security of our country. Those words were\ntrue 65 years ago when the law was passed and it is even more\ntrue today.\nThe Small Business Act sets a goal for Federal Government\nto spend 23 percent of all contracting dollars with small\nbusinesses. While I am pleased that we are meeting this goal, I\nam troubled that the data shows that we have a shrinking base\nof contractors rather than an expanding base of contractors. A\nrecent report by Bloomberg Government found that the number of\nFederal contractors working on unclassified, prime contracts is\nat a 10-year low, despite a steady rise in government contract\nspending over the same period.\nThis means that while contracts are getting bigger and\nbigger, we are creating an insular club with fewer and fewer\nbusinesses successfully competing for government contracts,\ncreating a less-competitive marketplace and reducing\nopportunities in the process, and that is contrary to what\nthese set-asides and programs are all about, and that is\nencouraging new small businesses that can bring innovation and\njob growth to our economy and help our Nation.\nThis trend is being driven by the largest agency. Since\nfiscal year 2009, the number of companies working on contracts\nwith the Department of Defense has declined by 24,000.\nSimilarly, the General Services Administration has seen an\n8,000-company decline. The Department of Veterans Affairs and\nInterior are both contracted with 13,600 fewer companies. These\nare very troubling figures. Predictably, our Nation's small\nbusinesses are bearing the brunt of this decline. According to\nthe same Bloomberg report, the Federal Government did business\nwith 32 percent fewer small vendors in fiscal year 2018 than it\ndid in fiscal year 2009. For comparison, the number of large\nvendors fell by only 4 percent.\nThis trend is a cause of great concern in my home State of\nMaryland, where the Federal Government spent $33 billion in\nFederal contract dollars in fiscal year 2018, including $11\nbillion to small businesses. We want to create contracting\nwhere small, innovative businesses are encouraged, not shut\nout.\nSo today I am looking forward to speaking with our\nwitnesses from SBA and GAO about how we can improve\nopportunities for our Nation's small businesses to contract\nwith the Federal Government. I am also looking forward to\nhearing from small business owners here today about the support\nthey need from the Federal Government to remain competitive and\ncompete in the marketplace.\nI want to thank all of our witnesses for joining us and I\nlook forward to hearing your testimony and innovative ideas for\nimproving the SBA contracting programs and the Federal\nGovernment small business contracting procedures.\nChairman Rubio. All right. We will move to our first panel.\nRobb Wong is the Associate Administrator of the Office of\nGovernment Contracting and Business Development at the SBA, and\nMr. William Shear is the Director of Financial Markets and\nCommunity Investment at the U.S. Government Accountability\nOffice.\nMr. Wong, thank you for being here. We will start with you.\nSTATEMENT OF ROBB WONG, ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR, OFFICE OF\nGOVERNMENT CONTRACTING AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, U.S. SMALL\nBUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, WASHINGTON, DC\nMr. Wong. Good afternoon, and thank you for the opportunity\nto testify and talk about the contracting and business\ndevelopment programs provided by SBA.\nSince March 2017, I have served as the Associate\nAdministrator for the Office of Government Contracting and\nBusiness Development. This is my second time at SBA, previously\nhaving worked before in the agency's Office of General Counsel,\nwhere I wrote many of the rules and regulations in the previous\nstate.\nIn my current role, I administer programs and services that\nassist small businesses in meeting the requirements to receive\ngovernment contracts. The Federal Government spends nearly $500\nbillion a year on goods and services through contracting, and\nthere are government-wide goals for awards to small businesses\nthat the SBA helps to foster and support.\nSince rejoining the agency over two years ago, my focus has\nbeen on Federal contracting officers across the Federal\nGovernment, and my goal has been simple--to make SBA-certified\ncompanies a better option for the contracting officer so that\nthey will increase the supply of government contracts to small\nbusiness.\nWe have looked at barriers that contracting officers may\nface in hitting their percentage goals. We want to grow the\necosystems by increasing the number of companies in that\nsystem, and we want to improve the quality of contracts. Again,\nit will help the contract officer to continue to award\ncontracts to small business.\nAs a foundation, SBA established and continues to refine\nour online platform, Certify.gov. Working with our CIO, Maria\nRoat, we brought the governance of the platform in-house. Our\nnext steps are to improve its functionality and interactivity,\nnot only for the public but also for our SBA analysts and\nstaff. This should help create a reliable tool to support the\ntransition of the women-owned small business certifications as\nwell as for any future considerations with certifying service-\ndisabled veteran-owned small businesses.\nRight now, the agency certifies over 10,000 companies in\nour 8(a) and HUBZone programs. The woman-owned and service-\ndisabled certifications total over 20,000. Adding that amount\nof volume and responsibility to our existing staff, without\nadditional funding, is something the agency continues to\nwrestle with.\nAdding to these challenges are aspects of the self-\ncertification process that my GAO colleague, Mr. Shear, has\nhighlighted. We have also been testing a unified application\nprocess to help standardize the way that the public applies and\nalso how SBA reviews both eligibility and continuing\neligibility. All of this must occur before we add the volume of\nnew cases from the WOSB Program, Women-Owned Small Business\nProgram. Excuse me.\nNext, let me update you on an issue that I know is of\ninterest to the members of the Committee. In late December, SBA\nreleased an information notice to stakeholders regarding the\nRunway Extension Act. Since then, we have worked to develop a\nrule which was sent to the Federal Register on Monday. When\npublished, this will further advise stakeholders and will begin\na public comment period to receive their input.\nI wanted to close by mentioning a few items that our\nprogram office continues to assess and that might lead to\nfurther discussion with the Committee.\nWe continue to look at the Federal appropriations cycle and\nany effect it may have on contracting officers. We continue to\nreview category management and whether it is hurting contract\navailability. We also continue to assess sole-source thresholds\nand whether they need to be adjusted.\nI connect these items back to my main goal, to help the\ncontracting officers and to make small businesses a better\noption for them. In my view, these items impair the\ngovernment's mission, as well as those people who help to\naccomplish it. These are all important factors in keeping small\nbusinesses in our Federal contracting programs, as every time a\nsmall business drops out it hurts our industrial base.\nThank you again for the opportunity to testify, and I look\nforward to working with you.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Wong follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nChairman Rubio. Thank you. Mr. Shear.\nSTATEMENT OF WILLIAM SHEAR, DIRECTOR, FINANCIAL MARKETS AND\nCOMMUNITY INVESTMENT, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE,\nWASHINGTON, DC\nMr. Shear. Chairman Rubio, Ranking Member Cardin, and\nmembers of the Committee, I am pleased to be here this\nafternoon to discuss our recent work on SBA's contracting\nprograms and SBA's progress in implementing our\nrecommendations.\nMy testimony today is based primarily on three reports we\nissued between September 2018 and March 2019, and also a report\nwe issued in October of 2014. I will discuss SBA's progress on\nimplementing our prior recommendations on first, its women's\nprocurement program, second, its HUBZone program in Puerto\nRico, and third, SBA's Procurement Scorecard. In the interest\nof time, I will largely focus on our work on the women's\nprocurement program in my oral statement.\nSBA has not fully addressed deficiencies we have previously\nidentified for the women's procurement program, and these\ndeficiencies are affected by SBA's ongoing implementation of\nchanges to the program authorized by the National Defense\nAuthorization Act of 2015. SBA implemented one of the three\nchanges to the program authorized in the 2015 NDAA when it\npublished a final rule to implement sole-source authority,\nwhich became effective October 2015. The two other changes,\nauthorizing SBA to implement its own certification process, and\nrequiring SBA to eliminate the option for firms to self-certify\nthat they are eligible for the program, have not been\nimplemented.\nIn addition, SBA has not fully addressed program oversight\ndeficiencies described in our March 2019 report, and first\nidentified in our October 2014 report. We recommended that SBA\nestablish comprehensive procedures to monitor and assess the\nperformance of the third-party certifiers in accordance with\ntheir agreements with SBA and program regulations.\nSBA conducted a compliance review of certifiers in 2016,\nbut SBA officials said, in June 2018, that SBA had no plans to\nconduct further compliance reviews until the final rule\nimplementing the new certification process was completed. SBA\nalso has not fully addressed deficiencies related to\neligibility exams. The exams identified high rates of\npotentially ineligible businesses. SBA does not collect\nreliable information on the results of its annual eligibility\nexams and continues to have no mechanism to look across exams\nfor common eligibility issues to inform the program.\nWith respect to SBA's HUBZone program, we have a large body\nof work over a period of time addressing the program. In our\nSeptember 2018 report, that focused on Puerto Rico, we\nidentified internal control deficiencies related to the\ncertification and recertification process that were generally\nconsistent with the deficiencies identified in previous work.\nWe are awaiting documentation from SBA related to the agency's\nplanned changes to the certification and recertification\nprocess.\nFinally, SBA has taken some steps to address recommendation\nof our September 2018 report about its Procurement Scorecard.\nSBA made revisions to address requirements specified in the\nNDAA for fiscal year 2016. Among other actions in response to\nour recommendations, SBA has proposed a two-phase program\nevaluation of the scorecard.\nPhase 1 would include a report to Congress, planned to be\nissued in September 2019, on the impact of the small business\nprocurement goal program for Chief Financial Officers Act\nagencies and to provide a recommendation on continuing,\nmodifying, expanding, or terminating the scorecard program. In\nPhase 2, SBA plans to conduct a program evaluation that\ninvestigates the effectiveness of the Small Business\nContracting Scorecard on Federal agencies, small business\ncontracting goal achievement.\nChairman Rubio, Ranking Member Cardin, and members of the\nCommittee, this completes my prepared statement. I look forward\nto your questions.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Shear follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nChairman Rubio. Thank you. I will just start with--in the\ninterest of time and for our members that have other places as\nwell, because we started late, so I am just going to ask two\nquestions and they are related.\nMr. Wong, in 2015, Congress passed that law requiring the\nSBA to set up the certification program for the Women-Owned\nSmall Business Programs. It has been four years. They have yet\nto comply. What authority does the SBA have not to comply with\nlaw, and why has it not complied?\nMr. Wong. The answer to your first question, we do not have\nthat authority to not comply, and the reason that we have not\ncomplied was certainly brought to my attention, and it is\nsomething I have worked on since the first month that I have\nbeen here. I am a lawyer by trade, so being out of compliance\nwith the law is absolutely unacceptable.\nThe challenge we have had, sir, is basically this. We have\nan ecosystem that we have looked at, that we have certain\nresponsibilities with our certifications to make sure that the\nright companies get into our program that are qualified, but\nthen we also have to make sure, before they get a contract, we\nhold the public trust to make sure that anyone who is awarded a\ncontract with an SBA certification is actually eligible to\nreceive it. Then we have to make the process easier to make\nsure that we can help the contracting officer with the supply\nof contracts.\nAs you noted in your statement earlier, we are dealing with\na system where we had, for 8(a) and for HUBZone, and then\npotentially WOSB--excuse me, Women-Owned Small Businesses--we\nhad three different silos. So literally what happened was if\nyou--we--if you gave the element of ownership to three\ndifferent people, they had three different systems on how to\nevaluate this program. That is unacceptable as well.\nSo when we were looking at WOSB, one of the first things I\nlooked at was I realized that when I looked at the volume of\napplications we had and the number of existing companies that\nwe had, we realized that we had three times the volume for the\npotential WOSB program that we had for any of our other\nprograms, particular the 8(a) program, which has been around\nfor 30 years.\nChairman Rubio. Just on this topic, I know you have been\nthere a month so you are trying to comply now. Correct?\nMr. Wong. Yes. Absolutely.\nChairman Rubio. Do you have any explanation? In the month\nthat you have been there, have you discovered why nothing has\nhappened in the last four years?\nMr. Wong. Yes. So--and just to clarify, I have been here a\nlittle bit over two years, but within one month of me being\nthere, two years ago, I tried to get a handle on what was going\non.\nThe short version of what we are trying to do is we should\nbe processing all of our applications the same way, to the\nextent possible. So what we have done is we have re-engineered\nall of these processes to match. In short, we have 8(a), which\nis our historically best program. We broke that down into\nelements of eligibility, which there are 11. Then we realized\nwith HUBZone there are six. And then we even went into each\nelement of eligibility and we determined the process of how you\nactually determine if someone is qualified under each----\nChairman Rubio. What I am just trying to wrap my mind\naround----\nMr. Wong. Yes, sir.\nChairman Rubio [continuing]. You have been there two years.\nWithin a month of getting there you started looking at this.\nMr. Wong. Yes.\nChairman Rubio. You have now been there for over two\nyears----\nMr. Wong. Yes.\nChairman Rubio [continuing]. And you are still going\nthrough this process of trying to organize it so you can\naddress it.\nMr. Wong. Yes. Originally, what we had done was we had come\nback to Congress----\nChairman Rubio. It does not take two years to do that, and\nit has not yet happened.\nMr. Wong. Yes, because we had to try three times now to\ncome up with a solution that we thought would be palatable for\nCongress. Yes, sir.\nChairman Rubio. Okay. Well, let me--Mr. Shear, let me ask\nyou. You have seen--well, the--they failed to implement the\nmandates from the 2015 NDAA on the Women-Owned Small Business\nProgram. Will the new proposed rule really fix the\ncertification program?\nMr. Shear. A new rule, whether the one proposed or another\nrule, is not going to fix the problem. The question is how does\nSBA implement this? We have seen a situation where SBA is not\nvigilant on either overseeing third-party certifiers or of\ncollecting accurate information when there are businesses that\ndo not seem to be eligible participating in the program, and\nfollowing up and looking for the underlying reasons.\nWe have made recommendations to SBA in a self-certified\nenvironment that we think not only are relevant for the self-\ncertified environment but the environment that would be created\nby a new certification process. We also think that our\nrecommendations would help inform that process.\nSo our concern----\nChairman Rubio. Are those recommendations reflected in the\nproposed rule?\nMr. Shear. In the proposed rule, the proposed rule which I\ndo not want to get into, third-party certifiers versus the use\nof SBA on its own, but what they all have in common is that\nthere is a lack of understanding and a lack of focus, like on\nfollowing up.\nIn 2016, there was a review of third-party certifiers,\nwhich not only could inform what job are they doing but could\nhelp inform what makes for good certification process. They had\na recommendation having to do with eligibility exams, where\nthey seemed to be starting, in 2016, to start looking at the\nunderlying causes. But both of those seem to have been\nsuspended for a rulemaking and we really cannot understand why.\nAnd it is also a mystery to us, just as I think it is\nsomething that you raised, which is a very good point. Why has\nit taken so long to--you know, without getting into the merits\nof the proposed rule, why has it taken so long to get this\nproposed rule out? We really do not understand. When we first\nasked for a timeline, a project plan for how they were going to\nget from A to B, they have never been able to produce that. So\nthat raises another concern for us.\nChairman Rubio. Well, the concern that I have is all those\nwomen-owned small businesses that should have qualified and\ncould have qualified but were bumped out of the queue by the\nones that should not have, because of the inaction that has\ntaken so long to get even to this point.\nRanking Member.\nSenator Cardin. Quite frankly, this is not acceptable. We\nhave a certification process right now for the 8(a) program and\nHUBZone, so it is not like SBA does not know how to do\ncertifications. It is hard for us to understand why the women-\nowned small businesses have not progressed. So do we have a\ntarget date when we are going to--when you are going to be able\nto give us something specific on this, when that date is?\nMr. Wong. The target--it should be contemporaneous with the\nWOSB rule. I misstated this in the hearing we had a couple of\nweeks ago, as 2021, but it should be contemporaneous with the\nrule in July 1st of 2020.\nSenator Cardin. Okay. So it will be another year.\nMr. Wong. Yes, but that--the rule is about as far as we can\npush it, but we want to make sure. What I have told our staff\nis we need to make sure that----\nSenator Cardin. That is not really--that is not acceptable.\nSo we will look at what we can do to--you know, it is\nchallenging for us. We passed a statute and we expect it to be\nimplemented.\nMr. Wong. I agree.\nSenator Cardin. And I think what the Chairman said is\nabsolutely accurate. These are extremely important programs. We\nwant to make sure that qualified companies can benefit from it.\nI think we all agree that SBA certification is where we need to\nbe----\nMr. Wong. Yes.\nSenator Cardin [continuing]. And we are not there. So it\nis--it remains a matter of frustration.\nWe will look at whether we cannot give you a little bit\nmore directive way to speed this up. I understand rulemaking\ntakes time. Believe me I do. But this is unacceptable.\nI want to get to the point in my opening statement on the\nnumber of small businesses and the decline in the number of\nsmall businesses participating, and talk a little bit about why\nwe do not have a larger supply base, why SBA has not encouraged\nthat. We have category management, as I understand it, on\nprocurement, which aims at larger contracts, which is a\ndisadvantage for small companies, particularly if their only\nentry is through subcontracting.\nSo what strategies can be deployed to get new small\ncompanies involved in government procurement to counter the\ntrends that we have seen over the last several years?\nMr. Wong. In my opinion, sir, there are two things that we\ncould do. If we could exempt small business programs from\ncategory management--if you look at what we do, we represent\nthe underserved. We represent 23 percent. We fight every year\nto make 23 percent.\nSenator Cardin. I am sorry. I was listening. I was just\ntelling my staff to--whether you need legislative authority to\nexempt from category management?\nMr. Wong. Probably.\nSenator Cardin. Well, why don't we find out whether you\nneed statutory authority or whether you can do that\nadministratively.\nMr. Wong. Even still, the specter of category management I\nthink is a good idea. Efficiency is always important. However,\nthe way that it is being applied now to small businesses has a\ndeleterious effect. The MAC report that came out even proves\nthat we are losing small businesses on both ends for two\ndifferent reasons, in my opinion.\nWhat happens is that we just have, even as recently as last\nFriday, we get calls from small businesses, for example, in our\n8(a) program. With our 8(a) program you get a certification,\nbut we tell you that you have to do your own marketing and that\nwill determine the success of your own business. Well, we have\npeople that are relying on that and they are working really\nhard, and they win these contracts, and they win these large\ncontracts and then they call us and they say, ``The government\nis taking our contract away, putting it into a category\nmanagement vehicle, and we do not qualify for that vehicle. So\nwe worked hard to get this exactly like you said and now you\ntook it away from us.''\nAnd for the small businesses, a lot of small businesses--\nand I have been a small business owner for 20 years before\nthis, and I have worked with is industry for at least 30 years.\nThey do not have lots of contracts to replace that with, and\noften if that is their mainstay contract they lose faith in the\nprogram, they lose faith in government contracting, so they\nquit. So we lose people from----\nSenator Cardin. I understand what you are saying. I might\nalso say the Army Futures Command in procurement also raises an\nissue whether that is going to be another hurdle that works to\nthe disadvantage of small companies. I want to explore the\nexemption issues that you are talking about, because I think\nthat does not make some sense.\nI also would hope that we could work on reporting\ninformation on prime and subcontracting so that we have a\nbetter understanding of how we can get direct business for\nsmaller companies rather than having to work as prime\ncontractors.\nMr. Wong. Absolutely.\nSenator Cardin. And one last point, and that is the Small\nBusiness Roadway Extension Act. You mentioned that a rule is\nbeing promulgated, I think today or yesterday, in your\ntestimony. That is already late. I would urge you to make sure\nthat is implemented as quickly as you are able to do it. It\ndoes not seem that complicated, quite frankly, and we want to\nmake sure that the intent of our statute is carried out.\nMr. Wong. Yes, sir. You know, two--may I address that\nissue?\nChairman Rubio. Yes.\nMr. Wong. Okay. So I also talk to people in Maryland. I\nlive in Maryland.\nSenator Cardin. If I knew that ahead of time I would not\nhave given you a hard time.\n[Laughter.]\nMr. Wong. I had an Asian dad, sir. That is not hard. It is\nokay.\nBut, sir, here is what happened. When we got the Runway\nExtension Act, okay, we understood what the intent was with\nCongress. And I tried to be helpful, I tried to be proactive,\nand I said, you know, we took a look at it, and what happened\nwas we got calls from people, and here is what was interesting.\nWe got calls from small businesses that this would help. It\nsays if we can count five years instead of three years, we can\nstill remain small. What is surprising is that we also got\ncalls that said, if this is active now, we have had some bad\nyears, so if we include five years it will actually hurt us.\nSo between the program office and between the attorneys, we\ntook a look at it, and we determined that the question about\nwhether or not--which contracts would be affected, was a\nlegitimate question. And so we decided that despite--instead of\nwaiting we would do what we could do, as much as we could do.\nSo we started with rulemaking to make sure that the intent of\nthe Runway Extension Act, to affect the small business programs\nat our agency and every agency, was affected. The most power\nthat we had, though, was to do it through a rule, and we have\ndone that as quickly as possible. That one should be commencing\naround January of 2020.\nWe also understand that there is another track that\nCongress is taking, but at the end of the day we are both\ntrying as quickly as we can to make sure that Congress' intent\nwas fulfilled. We tried to do it collaboratively and\ncooperatively, as quickly as we could.\nSenator Cardin. Thank you.\nChairman Rubio. Senator Ernst.\nSenator Ernst. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you to\nthe witnesses for being here today.\nThe SBA's contracting programs role in ensuring small\nbusinesses have opportunities to compete as Federal contractors\nis of significant importance, and I will address some of the\nissues I am really concerned about. I am glad that we have an\nopportunity to discuss ways to improve these programs, so\nagain, thank you for being here.\nAnd, Mr. Wong, I will start with you. In March, Senator\nTammy Duckworth and I introduced a bill called the Expanding\nContracting Opportunities for Small Businesses Act, and it\neliminates a discrepancy that puts women and service-disabled\nveterans who own small businesses at a disadvantage when\ncompeting for contracts by setting the contract manufacturing\nthreshold at $7 million for businesses certified under each\nprogram.\nCan you speak to the impact that you think this would have\nand what further steps we could do to support women and\nveteran-owned small businesses? Any ideas that you have would\nbe welcomed.\nMr. Wong. So I will caveat that the suggestions that I have\nare my own, having been a small business owner.\nWhat I would suggest is the 8(a) program, if you look at\nthis, this has been the backbone of our agency and it has been\nthe favorite contract vehicle of contracting officers for\nyears, particularly if you look at things where we have been\noperating in an environment where we work with continued\nresolutions.\nSenator Ernst. Right.\nMr. Wong. I talk to everyone as much as we can. And if you\nlook at, sometimes, a lot of these agencies, they have 55\npercent of their spending is done after April, in some of these\nyears. That is not enough time to run competitions, okay? So\nthat is why 8(a) is such a great vehicle. If we want to spur\nmore small business growth into this ecosystem, my suggestion\nwould be this, several things. First and foremost, we fix\nHUBZone, which we are trying to do, because I think that\nprogram could be just as powerful as 8(a). Next, what I think\nwe should do--the suggestion would be is to increase the\ncapacity or increase the thresholds. Because of category\nmanagement and consolidation you are getting larger contracts\nand more complex contracts. The problem is that the thresholds\nhave been set 20 years ago, in 1990. They have been set a while\nago, and that might be more than 20.\nSo the problem is that, you know, the joke that I say to\npeople is what do you have that is 30 years old today, other\nthan your spouse, that is just as good today as it was 30 years\nago? Well, we need to update the SBA limits for 2019 and\nbeyond, particularly because we have things like category\nmanagement, which is compressing things.\nSo right now, as an example, if you look at the way current\nthresholds work, we have a limit on a basic 8(a) company of $4\nmillion, divided by the number of option years. Four million\ndivided by 5, people tell me, is $800,000 a year. Right now,\nthough, the basic contracts, for a contracting officer, that is\nnot very much help to a contracting officer. That becomes like\nif they have a big pile of sand, of trying to get it off the\ndesk with a teaspoon.\nI want to turn that teaspoon into a shovel, and the way we\ndo that, to--you know, at the end of the day, if we fix that\nfor the contracting officer, they are the guardians of the\nsupply of government contracts. If you can increase the\ncapacity at which--or the thresholds at which these sole-source\nawards are awarded, the government contracting officer will\nlove that. I have learned that anecdotally through\nconversations with them.\nSo finally what we do, if we can exempt category\nmanagement--or small business from category management, here is\nanother thing. If you take the added capacity, now, if you look\nat what is going into category management, these are all large\ncontracts. They are over $1 million. But if you give the\ncapacity to the contracting officer, with up to $4 million a\nyear, as an example, for each of the 8(a)s, the government\ncontracting officer has two weapons in its arsenal. They can\nmake that award, they can allow the small business to\nparticipate because a lot of the contracting officers like\nthose contracts. So when those contracts are removed into\ncategory management we have many disappointed parties.\nSo if you increase the threshold for that, the government\ncan keep those contracts working with small businesses, and\neven with--we have worked with OMB, or OFPP. They have a\ndirective on category management. They kept something in there\nin footnote 31 that says meeting a small business goal is\njustification not to use category management. So if we can do\nthat.\nAnd the final thing that I personally would recommend is\nthat we give the contracting officer, and say to him or her\nthat if you have missed one of your socioeconomic goals in the\nprevious year, SBA will temporarily give you 8(a)-like sole-\nsource direct authority for every socioeconomic category you\nhave missed. And I think that what that will do is that will\nkeep--excuse me. Last important thing, sorry. As long as you\nhit your 8(a) goal first.\nSo what I think that will do, from an ecosystem point of\nview, you are going to have government procurement hitting that\n8(a) goal first. It is still special because it operates\ndifferently than the other programs, but it will also make it\ncapable, and it will make it more attractive for women-owned,\nfor HUBZones, and for service-disabled to use our products. We\nwill bring people into the ecosystem, reward them because they\nhave higher capacity, and it will be able to abut some of the\nproblems that we have with category management.\nIf we remove small businesses from category management, at\nleast temporarily, learn how that works efficiently with the\nother 77 percent. So when you take a large contract from a\nlarge company they have more. But when you take it from a small\nbusiness that only has that, they quit. And even if you are one\nof the lucky ones that gets into category management, for a\nsmall business, you make so much money you size out, and so you\ndo not quit but you have to leave.\nSenator Ernst. Yes, no. I think it is very good and I\nappreciate it. I am sorry. We have gone over time. But it was\nreally great information and I do think we need to look at\nthese for the 8(a)s.\nAnd just a comment that I think there is only one program\nthat actually teaches people how to do government contracting,\nand so that is something that we need to focus on as well, so\nthat we do have more women business owners, more minority\nbusiness owners, more of those service-connected disabled\nveterans that are engaging in this area as well.\nSo thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nMr. Wong. Ma'am, to your point, Stanley Jones, Jr. is in\nthe audience with us. He is responsible for that. He had a\ngreat idea that instead of delivering one-on-one capability to\npeople we are trying to do one-to-all. The directive we are\ntrying to do has become more relevant to the 30 million small\nbusinesses out there. So what we are trying to do is come up\nwith modules that teach all businesses how to identify, pursue,\ncapture, and execute business opportunities, whether it is\ngovernment or not. But that is a great suggestion.\nChairman Rubio. Senator Shaheen.\nSenator Shaheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you\nboth for being here.\nMr. Shear, do you think what Mr. Wong is proposing is a\ngood idea?\nMr. Shear. When it comes to statutory changes we do not\nhave work that provides a basis to comment on those. But let me\ngo to looking at the issue, concerns with category management,\nfor example. Let me start with that.\nSenator Shaheen. Okay. Why don't you start with explaining\nwhat category management is.\nMr. Shear. Thank you. With category management, the idea is\nthat you have aggregation of different types of procurements so\nthat you are limiting the number of businesses that compete. So\nit tends to lead to kind of larger, you know, larger\nprocurements, and this can have an adverse effect on small\nbusinesses.\nSo what I am going to----\nSenator Shaheen. Give me an example.\nMr. Shear. It has been used, for example--I am trying to\nremember what the eagle program is called that GSA had, but it\ncomes down to it can be as simple as providing office products\nper se, that you are limiting the number of firms that can\ncompete to provide through those vehicles. So it can lead to a\nsmaller number of small businesses that might be able to\nparticipate.\nSo let me start with category management, if you can take--\nI am sorry my definition is not more specific than that--but\nlet me take that as an example. We now are initiating, on a\nlarge engagement, looking at category management, including\nimpacts on small businesses, but in doing that we are going to\njump back, as a starting point, what the processor was,\nstrategic sourcing a number of years ago. And what we find,\nwith these types of vehicles, that there are certain provisions\nof the Small Business Act that become even more important in\nensuring that small businesses really have the opportunities\nthey should be having.\nSo, for example, we have the Offices of Small and\nDisadvantaged Business Utilization. We have done work that\nshows many agencies are not in compliance with the requirements\nto make sure that what are called the OSDBUs really have the\nstature in the agency and the roles in the agency that are\nnecessary for them to represent small business interests. And\nwhen we look back at strategic sourcing we saw a definite\ndistinction between agencies where the OSDBUs really had a seat\nat the table and those where they did not.\nSo looking at those Small Business Act provisions through\nthe roles of the OSDBUs, you know, the procurement center\nrepresentatives at SBA, it becomes more important to try to\nidentify how, in this environment, we can still provide\ncontracting opportunities for small businesses. So I wanted to\ndraw attention to that.\nJust on the other thing, on women's procurement and\nservice-disabled veteran-owned small business, SBA has talked\nfor years about trying to bring technology into its oversight\nof the program and technology to try to make these programs\nmore user-friendly for contract officers and for the firms that\nare participating in it. And so we certainly--our\nrecommendations are very much geared toward the idea of\nbringing that type of technology, as far as a solution, to try\nto not only make sure ineligible firms are not participating\nbut that these programs become more accessible for contract\nagencies.\nSenator Shaheen. So is there anybody that you would cite\nwho is doing this well, that either you or Mr. Wong would cite,\nany agencies within the Federal Government that you think are\ndoing a good job?\nMr. Shear. The agency that stands out for me, in terms of\nthe role of the OSDBU director, in terms of identifying, you\nknow, opportunities for set-asides and other things, in this\nenvironment where we have, let's say, strategic sourcing, which\nwe have looked at, and category management we have looked at,\nwould be the Department of Homeland Security.\nSenator Shaheen. And how about with women-owned small\nbusinesses, and what are they doing that makes them stand out?\nHow are they doing a good job?\nMr. Shear. With women-owned small businesses, I think,\nreally, the ball is in SBA's court to come up with a system\nthat contract officers can really use, where the certification\nreally means something that has some confidence for them, that\nthey feel confident in using, you know, women-owned small\nbusiness set-asides.\nSenator Shaheen. So you--neither of you can recommend any\nagency within the Federal Government that is doing a good job\nwith contracting out to women-owned small businesses, that is\nmeeting their--the 5 percent target regularly, that has\npractices in place that you think are good at reaching out to\nthose businesses?\nMr. Wong. I think--I think that there--sorry.\nMr. Shear. No. go ahead.\nMr. Wong. I think that there are several. DHS is certainly\none of those.\nSo I had an opportunity, for example, to talk to Kevin\nBoshears, who is actually retiring next week. Maybe you could\ncall him and tell him not to.\nSenator Shaheen. Um, so----\nMr. Wong. But they do it by looking at every single\nprocurement. They work with their procurement shop to do that.\nIt is to their credit, however, the system that they have is\nvery different than other agencies. And there are other\nagencies that do hit their women target sporadically. I could\nget you a list. I do not have that off the top of my head.\nBut----\nSenator Shaheen. Is there a list posted on the website of\nthe SBA?\nMr. Wong. I do not think that there is a historical one,\nbut I can get you everything that you need.\nSenator Shaheen. Well, I am out of time, but just a follow-\nup. Is the issue having an individual in that position who is\ncommitted to it and who does a good job, or is the issue having\na process in place that actually makes it happen?\nMr. Shear. You have to have an agency that is willing to\ngive the stature to their director. So, I mean, you have two\npeople--you know, you have a director that is involved and you\nhave an agency, but you have certain agencies that have\nfacilitated this more complete role. Now, you know, both of us\nknow Kevin Boshears well. He is one that has been given that\nstature and he has earned that stature, so it goes hand-in-\nhand.\nSenator Shaheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Rubio. Senator Cantwell.\nSenator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you\nfor holding this important hearing on SBA's contracting\nprograms.\nI wanted to ask about an important issue for continuing to\ngive women access to Federal contracts. The current law\nprovides that women-owned businesses must have unconditional\nownership by women of 51 percent interest in their company to\nmaintain that SBA certification. I will just note that the\nFederal Government never met its 5 percent goal until we\nchanged the sole-source contracting element, so when we changed\nthat in 2015, we made our goals. We may have slipped, but I\njust think we have to keep peeling back the issues that are\nprohibiting us. And, obviously, with 50 percent of the society\ncoming up with ideas we definitely want to make sure that they\nare getting access to capital to do so.\nSo one thing I am working with Chairman Rubio on, and I\nappreciate his attention to this and I am happy to work with\nhim on this, is to make sure women-owned businesses can get\nequity investments that they need to grow and still be able to\ncompete for those government contracts. This is an important\naspect of their business and also important for winning\ncontracts.\nSo do either of you have any concern or opposition about\nthat language, making sure that women-owned businesses are not\npenalized from investment from venture capitalists at all?\nMr. Wong. Ma'am, the only challenge we might have is that\ngenerally we--the issue we have that is in the 8(a) program is\na control issue, okay. But assuming that we can make sure that\nthe ownership is there and that the control rests with women-\nowned companies, I have no problem with that. I mean, we are a\ndifferent--you know, when these rules came out, venture capital\nwas not--that was something that only elite companies did. Now\neverybody is doing it.\nSo I think that if we set our minds to it--and this is my\npersonal opinion--that, you know, investment at certain ages is\nalmost a necessary prerequisite, or at least an avenue. At the\nend of the day, I think that investment makes a better company.\nIf they are a better company, they have better quality. If they\nhave better quality, then that goes hand-in-hand, because that\nis how we make awards. We want stronger companies. So I like\nthat idea.\nSenator Cantwell. Okay.\nMr. Shear.\nMr. Shear. We have not done work analyzing that issue to\nopine one way or the other.\nSenator Cantwell. Okay. Well, I thank the Chairman for his\nleadership on this, and I think it just--you know, when we are\nlooking at this issue of why we do not have more success in\nwomen-owned businesses, we have to look at what are the\nstumbling blocks, and I would consider this one of the\nstumbling blocks, and we should just proceed and knock it down,\nand allow women to have more investment and still have these\ngovernment contracts.\nSo thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Rubio. Thanks for the work you have done, and\nthe--fixed the VC investments are a key part. You cannot, in\nthe 21st century, in any century, really, but you cannot really\nprosper as a business if you do not have access to investment,\nwhich is increasingly steering away from small business writ\nlarge, but in particular, among those owned by minorities and\nthose owned by women. So I am grateful for all the work you\nhave put in.\nSenator Hirono. You can use this time, as well, to announce\nour Hawaii party at five today.\nSenator Hirono. Yes. All of you are invited to Hawaii--a\nTaste of Hawaii on the Hill, consisting mainly of small\nbusinesses from Hawaii.\nA lot of us are very supportive of the socioeconomic groups\nthat we want to have awarded these huge--well, not the huge,\nbut their share of government contracts. So with regard to the\nDepartment of Defense, which has a lot of contracts, the so-\ncalled Section 809--this is for Mr. Wong--809 Panel released\nrecommendations to eliminate most small business set-asides at\nthe Department of Defense.\nSo I have heard from small businesses in Hawaii, including\nour Native Hawaiian-owned businesses, who are seriously\nconcerned about what these recommendations, if implemented,\nwould mean for small businesses in the United States. And, of\ncourse, set-asides have been an important tool for Federal\nGovernment departments and agencies like DoD to meet their\nsmall business contracting goals, especially for small,\ndisadvantages businesses, women-owned small businesses,\nservice-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, Native\nHawaiian small businesses, and others.\nSo, Mr. Wong, can you elaborate on the importance of small\nbusiness set-asides for Federal Government departments and\nagencies in meeting their contracting goals?\nMr. Wong. Yes, ma'am, I can. If you want to talk--in terms\nof the--you were talking about the Native programs,\nparticularly in Hawaii----\nSenator Hirono. Well, the concern has been raised by the\nNative Hawaiian-owned businesses because a number of them did\ncontract with the Department of Defense and suddenly that\nnumber has plummeted.\nMr. Wong. We heard about that on Friday. Yep, I absolutely\nagree.\nYour first point, the 809 Panel is certainly an efficient\npanel, but, by the same token, it is diametrically opposed to\nour mission.\nSenator Hirono. Yes.\nMr. Wong. We are all about, and we support the mission of\nmaximum practicable opportunity for small business.\nSenator Hirono. Yes. I share that.\nMr. Wong. Small businesses, by their nature, are not the\nmost efficient, but they are important, and they are important\nto develop--to our industrial base.\nSenator Hirono. Mm-hmm.\nMr. Wong. What I like about the Native companies,\nparticularly the Hawaiian companies as well----\nSenator Hirono. Mm-hmm.\nMr. Wong [continuing]. Is that they are power users with\n8(a). They allow, again, this shovel for a contracting officer\nto help them to deliver the work.\nThe other thing that I think that is noble about the Native\ncompanies is that they have a responsibility that is much\ngreater than just running a small business. You know, as you\nknow, and as we have discussed, they have to take care of past,\npresent, and future generations, and that is a concern that\nalmost no other business in the United States has.\nSenator Hirono. Yes. They have, basically, like a social\npublic good kind of a requirement for them that is not applied\nto any other small business.\nMr. Wong. That is correct. And so I think that when the 809\nPanel, when they are talking about reducing set-asides, I\nabsolutely would not agree with that.\nSenator Hirono. So has SBA voiced their concerns?\nMr. Wong. Absolutely. I went----\nSenator Hirono. And what has been the reaction?\nMr. Wong. So when I first got there I went over with Ken\nDodds, who is also in our audience right now, and when we were\nthere--we went over there, I think, for the third time, and I\nthink it was Mr. Drabkin, who was the head of this, said, ``Mr.\nWong, you look like a nice fellow, but we are not aligned.''\nBut he says that, so--he says, ``That is okay, but our job is\nto make these recommendations.''\nThe 809 Panel, similar to category management, in my\nopinion, has the effect of destroying the industrial base. If\nyou look at SBA, our history, our creation was founded on\nreplenishing and strengthening that industrial base. That is\nwhy our mission of maximum practicable opportunity is there.\nSenator Hirono. And, by the way, you know, I sit on the\nArmed Services Committee, and for so many of our large\ncontractors they need a huge, thousands of people in their\nsupply chain. And if this recommendation by the Section 809\nPanel disrupts that chain and starts to--and if it starts to\nresult in thousands of the people who are in the chain go out\nof business, that is bad----\nMr. Wong. It hurts our country.\nSenator Hirono [continuing]. For our large contractors\nalso. So what can we all do? Can this Committee weigh in? Is\nthere something we can do to say, ``Wait a minute. This is not\nthe way to go, DoD?''\nMr. Wong. If we could work collaboratively, I would love to\nwork collaboratively with you to help raise our voice with the\n809 Panel and with Congress. But I think we should fight this.\nSenator Hirono. I hope that this is something, Mr.\nChairman, that we can pursue.\nSo I do have some other concerns. Yeah, I hear the concerns\nregarding the support for women-owned businesses, because we\nare not hitting our goals. Can you clarify something for me?\nDoes every Federal department have to reach these--the 20\npercent contracting goals? Every department--DoD, Homeland\nSecurity, everybody?\nMr. Wong. So the technical answer is no, but the way I\nwould like to describe it is, if you have a pie that represents\n100, we have to eat 23 percent, and we have to go to each of\nthe agencies, who, if some can eat more in certain portions\nthen they eat more, and we negotiate that with them.\nSenator Hirono. So it would seem that we are not going to\nrequire every department to meet these goals, because some can\nexceed those goals. Why don't we make every department meet\nthese goals?\nMr. Wong. Because I think that for some--depending on how\nyou look at the buys--the short version is that every agency\ndoes not treat--does not buy from the same sources for the\nthings that they need, so we are mindful of that.\nSenator Hirono. Do you think that kind of approach still is\nreasonable now, or have there not been some changes?\nMr. Wong. My personal feeling is that--and I will give you\na lawyer's answer; we are both lawyers--is under the rules that\nwe have we have exceeded that 23 percent for the sixth year in\na row, but more importantly, in terms of number of dollars,\nwhich translate directly into jobs, no matter who gets those\ncontracts, we have increased this market by about 21 percent.\nSo despite the misgivings that we have, we are hitting the\ngoals that we have, but this is also why, when we are talking,\nyou know, one of the things that is inherent to me is that when\nthe government hits a goal and we task somebody specifically in\nthe government to achieve it, they tend to achieve it. And the\nperson and people who are responsible, in this case for\ngovernment contracts, is the contracting officer. They have the\nmost power to do that, because they are the ones that are\ndelegated by their leadership--you have got to hit these goals,\nright?\nSo that is why I am generally saying make it easier for\nthem, using SBA programs, and they will hit that goal.\nSenator Hirono. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for letting me go\nover.\nChairman Rubio. Just as a point of information, I believe\nSenator Duckworth has filed a Sense of the Senate to the NDAA\nbill----\nSenator Hirono. Oh, thank you.\nChairman Rubio [continuing]. That would add--that would\noppose the recommendation to remove the DoD set-aside. I think\nthe Armed Services Committee has a different opinion, so we\nwill see how that plays itself out.\nSenator Romney, you would be next. You just arrived. I\ncan--I am going to buy some time, or--I can ask a question,\nactually.\nSenator Romney. Why don't you go ahead and let me take a--\n--\nChairman Rubio. It is a short question.\nSenator Romney. Okay.\nChairman Rubio. Just on the issue that you talked about,\nMr. Wong, and that is the importance of small business to our\nindustrial base, do you think that, when it comes to government\ncontracting it is an enormous customer, particularly in the\nDepartment of Defense field but across the board. And this is\nmore of a 50,000-foot-level question, but is it your sense that\nin addition to having laws in place that require certain\nbehavior that there is an opening here to also have a broader\nnational conversation about the importance of a domestic\nsubcontractor and/or manufacturing supply chain that is capable\nof delivering certain steps along the process?\nSo obviously, in the realm of DoD, it is a little different\nbecause of the security elements that are built into these\ncontracts, but there are plenty of industries now in which we\nbelieve that large multinationals who are headquartered in the\nUnited States dominate a field without any sort of national\nrecognition of the fact that many of the subcontracts and\ncomponent activities underneath that big umbrella are\noftentimes having to be outsourced to other countries, because\nwe no longer have the domestic capacity to do certain things.\nAnd this becomes concerning when you begin to realize that,\nin many of these fields, that are outside the realm of DoD, but\nwhether it is telecommunications or any of these other critical\nindustries, for our future, we are not engaged in a business-\nto-business competition. These have become national\ncompetitions, oftentimes in the case of China, against\ncompanies fully backed by a large and powerful government.\nSo it appears to me that that sort of notion needs to find\nitself into this conversation as well.\nMr. Wong. Yes, sir, I agree. You did mention China, and so\nI would just simply say that one of the phenomena that they\nhave is they could be sitting in a room, they come up with an\nidea that makes sense, they can implement it in a matter of\nweeks. Our rules and regulations still require months, years.\nSo I think that if there is a way to entertain that\nconversation, absolutely. If you could include us in that we\nwould be happy to work with you on that.\nChairman Rubio. Senator Romney.\nSenator Romney. Thank you, Senator. I must begin by saying\nI am not a hostile questioner, but partially so in that I do\nnot like the idea of set-asides generally, or requirements that\npeople purchase, or that the government purchases from\ninstitutions that are either high cost or less efficient. It\nstrikes me that small businesses that have the best prospects\ncome out with better products at lower cost, and that the world\nwould beat a path to their door. But that requiring the\ngovernment to acquire products based upon other requirements\nother than the quality, price, and efficiency of the product\nbeing sold is a mistake.\nI will put that comment aside for a moment and turn to\nsomething else which is the--with regards to the program\nassociated with the net worth limit, particularly for those\nprograms helping disadvantaged women. The net worth has to be\nless than $750,000, as I understand it, and given the fact that\nthe median net worth in the country is $97,000, it strikes me\nthat if you are an individual with a net worth of $750,000,\nexcluding your home, you are probably in the top 1 percent of\nthe country. This hardly strikes me as being a program for\nunderprivileged individuals.\nShould we not reconsider what net worth is appropriate to\njustify investment in such a small enterprise owned by a person\nof that nature?\nMr. Wong. Senator, thank you for the question. If I could\nclarify, the $750,000 is a ceiling. It is not a floor. And so\nwhat we do is we limit people, that if they get into business\nand then they get up to a certain level then we kick them out.\nSenator Romney. Right. Right. But kicking them out--\n$750,000 is well above what I would consider a person that is\ndisadvantaged and needs help. If the number were $50,000 or\n$100,000 I might not, in my head. But the median in the country\nis $97,000. Why would a number like $97,000 not be the better\nnumber to use, or half that? But to say that a person can have\n$700,000 in personal net worth, excluding their home, that is\ngoing to be a relatively small cohort of individuals who would\nhave a net worth at that level.\nMr. Wong. So, anecdotally, this is my opinion. I think\nthat--and I have dealt with many businesses over the last 30\nyears, and I have run 16 of them. I think that people with\n$97,000 of personal net worth do not tend to hire many people.\nAnd so with somebody--you know, if somebody has $750,000, I\nagree, it is a higher number than the average national net\nworth, but it has been something that we have been using with\nthe 8(a) program for over 30 years. We have created a lot of\njobs. We have created a lot of businesses with that program,\nsir, and I think that it works.\nSenator Romney. I would suggest that you are not creating\nthe jobs, that people who begin those enterprises are creating\nthe jobs, their potential to find capital from other sources.\nIf they have got a great business idea and a net worth of\n$700,000, they are going to be able to begin that business and\ncreate the jobs without the help of the government. So having\nFederal dollars, having average taxpayers in America provide\nsubsidy, in effect, to individuals who have a net worth of as\nmuch as $750,000, excluding their home, strikes me as being\nexcessive and not really targeted to the people we are focused\non helping, which are people of very modest or disadvantaged\ncircumstances.\nI guess I will stop there, Mr. Chairman, other than to say\nthat I think with regards to each of these programs, we need to\nre-evaluate whether we are really helping people who could not\nget help from the private sector, and whether we are wise to\ndirect the government, in its purchasing process, to favor the\npurchase from an enterprise that is not as competitive as the\nalternatives.\nChairman Rubio. Great. Thank you very much.\nThank you both for being here. Do we have anything else?\nThank you both for being here. I am going to call up the second\npanel. Thank you for your time and for your patience, given the\nvote schedule and the delay in our start.\nMr. Shear. Thank you very much.\nChairman Rubio. So as we kind of accommodate the transition\nhere in the panel, let me introduce them, give them a few\nseconds.\nAll right. I want to introduce our second panel.\nVicki Marino is the Founder and President of Kenmar General\nContracting, in Key West, Florida. She started Kenmar in 2002.\nShe became the first female licensed general contractor in\nMonroe County, Florida. For those of you not familiar with\nMonroe County, Florida, that is the world-famous Florida Keys.\nDelali Dzirasa is the Founder and President--is that\ncorrect? Did I say that, Dzirasa?--Dzirasa is the Founder and\nPresident of Fearless, a digital services firm in Baltimore,\nMaryland, with a HUBZone certification.\nAnd Laurie Sayles is the Founder and CEO of Civility\nManagement Solutions in Hyattsville, Maryland. Her company\nprovides professional consulting services and is certified as\nan 8(a), Women-Owned, Economically Disadvantaged, Women-Owned,\nand Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business. She spent\nseven years of active duty in the Marine Corps and is the first\nfemale veteran officer on the Veteran Entrepreneurial Task\nForce.\nThank you, all three, for being here. Ms. Marino, we will\nbegin with you.\nTESTIMONY OF VICKI MARINO, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, KENMAR\nGENERAL CONTRACTING, KEY WEST, FL\nMs. Marino. Good afternoon, Chairman Rubio, Ranking Member\nCardin, and members of the Committee. My name is Vicki Marino.\nI own Kenmar General Contracting in Key West, Florida, and am\ntestifying on behalf of Women Impacting Public Policy, a\nnational, nonpartisan organization advocating on behalf of\nwomen entrepreneurs. My company is 8(a) certified, as well as\nEDWOSB certified. Thank you for inviting me to testify today.\nIn 2011, I landed my first Federal contract after success\nin the commercial marketplace as the first licensed woman\ngeneral contractor in Monroe County, Florida. Working with SBA\nand a large company, through the SBA Mentor Protege Program,\nafforded me access to the resources necessary to build past\nperformance and become a successful Federal contractor.\nI want to take a moment to give a special shout-out to a\ncontracting officer, Paula Claudio. Paula shepherded my\ncompany's WOSB, sole-source award through SOUTHCOM, making it\none of the first to be awarded to a woman-owned construction\ncompany. I cannot tell you how important this action was to\nfurther our Federal presence and to potentially earn another\nexceptional past performance rating. Due to this effort, I am\nin the process of opening an office in Puerto Rico to help with\nthe rebuilding effort.\nDespite working as hard as I could to make my 8(a)\ncertification productive, it took me all of nine years to hit\nmy stride as a Federal contractor. Had it not been for WIPP's\nprocurement expertise, receptive contracting officers, and\nsupport from the SBA, I would not have been able to get much\ntraction. I would like to share a few recommendations and\nobservations which I hope the Committee will find helpful.\nGiven the complexity of Federal contracting and the length\nof time it takes to build a CPARS exceptional evaluation\nrating, I recommended adding a transition time for 8(a) firms,\nas we transition to competing in a larger pool of small\nbusinesses. SBA's contracting resources should also be expanded\nto include support for businesses at this stage.\nWe encourage this Committee to look at changing\nsocioeconomic programs to better reflect the trends in Federal\nbuying and overcome the reluctance of agencies to use these\nprograms. WIPP members tell us that contracting officers do not\nunderstand the WOSB/EDWOSB program, requiring the WOSB small\nbusiness owners to come armed with specific instructions on how\nto use the program. We recommend streamlining small business\nprograms and requiring education for contracting officers.\nFurther, we suggest changing sole-source rules to make them\nuniform. For example, while 8(a) companies can obtain sole-\nsource contracts at $4 million or $6.5 million, without market\nresearch or justification, women-owned small businesses,\nHUBZones, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses\nrequire that a contracting officer must justify, through market\nresearch, that not two or more offers at a reasonable price are\nexpected, leading to exceedingly few sole-source awards. WIPP\nrecommends Congress put all socioeconomic contracting programs\non equal footing.\nCertification for the WOSB/EDWOSB programs should be\nstreamlined. In addition, all WOSBs who are willing to\nparticipate in the Federal market should be certified, even if\nthey do not intend to utilize the set-aside program. Certifying\nto SBA would discourage fraudulent behavior. A critical\ncomponent of certification is a site visit, so we suggest\nutilizing third-party certifiers.\nWith respect to what qualifies a woman as EDWOSB, we urge\nthe Committee to change the definition of ``net worth.'' Before\nthe age of 59\\1/2\\, retirement accounts do not count toward net\nworth calculation. If the retirement account has early\nwithdrawal penalties, it does not count toward asset total.\nHowever, retirement funds lift those penalties at age 59\\1/2\\.\nWomen who are above this age must count retirement funds, often\nresulting in disqualification for EDWOSB status, putting older\nfemale entrepreneurs at a disadvantage.\nIn addition, the current definition of what constitutes a\nwoman-owned or a minority-owned firm includes a requirement\nthat ownership must be unconditional, leading to a lack of\nequity investment in these firms. Given the size of contracts,\nthis is a barrier to growth that should be removed.\nLastly, I want to thank this Committee for passing the\nRunway Extension Act last year. This new law will greatly\nassist businesses experiencing growth in the Federal\nmarketplace. WIPP urges the Committee to continue holding SBA\naccountable as they begin the rulemaking process to expedite\nimplementation.\nIn conclusion, small business contracting programs are\ncritical to the ability for small companies like mine to obtain\nFederal contracts, but they need revamping to meet today's\nbuying realities. In addition, we should be taking what is\nworking from each program and apply it to all the other\nprograms.\nI urge you to take steps that will increase Federal buying\nfrom small businesses so that the government can meet the\nmodest goals set for women, veterans, 8(a), and HUBZone\ncertified companies.\nThis concludes my testimony and I am happy to answer any of\nyour questions. Thank you.\n[The prepared statement of Ms. Marino follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nChairman Rubio. Thank you.\nMr. Dzirasa.\nTESTIMONY OF DELALI DZIRASA, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, FEARLESS\nSOLUTIONS, BALTIMORE, MD\nMr. Dzirasa. I got a text from a friend earlier and it said\n``be sure not to embarrass the family, friends, or the\ncountry,'' so I will do my best today.\nChairman Rubio, Ranking Member Cardin, and members of the\nCommittee, thank you for your time and opportunity to testify\ntoday. My name is Delali Dzirasa and I have a confession to\nmake, that I do not belong here. You know, this was not\nsupposed to be my path and my role, so how did I end up here? I\nhad a mother that really invested in work ethic, and taught us\nas young boys you had to work hard and accomplish your dreams.\nAnd what she said was she believed in the power of human\npotential, that the power of tomorrow--that tomorrow can always\nbe better than it is today.\nAnd my dad had some lessons to learn also. We had a\nsoftware company. We worked for him as kids, and learned two\nthings. One, I love technology, and two, that I would never,\nabsolutely ever work for my dad again.\nSo based on those lessons learned, I started a company. I\nfounded Fearless in 2009. We are a digital services firm, and\nwe say our mission is to build software with a soul. And we\nreally envision a world where good software ought to power\nthings that matter, and so all of that commercial innovation\nthat you see, we want to have the power harvest within the\nFederal Government to be a benefit to the American people at\nlarge.\nGrowing up as a kid, I watched my father grow a small\nbusiness. Today, my small business powers SBA.gov, the digital\nface of the Small Business Administration, where millions of\nAmericans can grow and start their businesses and obtain\nfunding.\nI watched my mother as she cared for aging individuals.\nToday, CMS uses our technology to allow every Medicare\nbeneficiary in the country to better share patient records\nsecurely and easily.\nFearless also powers Login.gov and Search.gov, the Federal\nGovernment's search engine.\nThese lessons along the way taught me in the belief of\npotential, but I also needed an opportunity, and the SBA\nprograms provided that opportunity for me. So I am here\ntestifying on behalf of the HUBZone Council, a nonprofit trade\norganization that supports the HUBZone program, because I got\nthat opportunity, and the Council would like to thank the\nCommittee for their commitment to small businesses across the\ncountry.\nOur relationship with the HUBZone program is a bit unique.\nI heard about the program early on in our history and it was\nabout economic development communities and neighborhoods that\nneeded it. We were passionate about it, excited about it, so\nmuch so that I moved our family from the suburbs into\nBaltimore. Baltimore is a tale often of two cities, right, one\nwhere there is plenty of opportunity but also where almost a\nquarter of the population lives below the Federal poverty line.\nAs I walk to work from day to day, I see individuals,\nwhether laying on the street, and recently, a couple of weeks\nago, there was a kid that was struck by a car, one of the\n``Squeegee boys'' they call them, washing windshields, trying\nto make a couple of bucks on the way to school. These are the\nvery people the HUBZone program was meant to support, and so\nyou can imagine how I was completely heartbroken to know that\nthe HUBZone program has not met its goal, ever, in the history\nof the program. And so all of that funding, we calculated, was\nover $7 billion that were ineligible for these communities that\nneed it most were not getting there.\nSo we took it as a labor of love to figure out why and how\nwe could fix the problem. So on one end you had $7 billion. On\nthe other hand you had lots of people unemployed, that were\nlooking for opportunities, not handouts, to get jobs.\nSo that is the map at that point. We realized technology\nneeded some updates. We realized there were two major issues--\ntechnology and policy. On the tech side, we are a software\ncompany, so what did we do? We ended up taking SBA's data--the\nmap was dated, reporting the wrong information. We scraped it\non our own. We built our own map, and what we thought the map\nought to be. That eventually got the attention of SBA, which\nthen called us and awarded us a contract to modernize all of\nthe HUBZone technology nationwide.\nSo we are here to testify to say we have helped to support\nand fix some of the technology, and now we are here because we\nneed support to fix the policy.\nOn the policy side, we think there are lots of incremental\nchanges that can be made within the program, but above\nincremental changes, we think big, bold changes are needed, and\nthe bold changes that also were included in how these\ncertification programs began in the first place, are needed at\nthis time.\nThe HUBZone program is unique in how it provides and\nsupports communities, and so we ask for two things. One, we\nhave heard streamline the sole-source opportunities for HUBZone\ncompanies and all the certification programs to be on parity\nwith the 8(a) program, and two, up the small business goal, in\ngeneral, across the board. Small businesses are often called\nthe backbone of the economy, and so it is odd that they control\nand create the majority of the jobs, but yet they are a\nfraction of the percentage of revenue that goes out.\nAnd why is this important now? You have recently passed\nlegislation around opportunity zones, and so investment is\ngoing into a lot of these same communities. And so if you pair\nit with the Jobs Creation Act through the HUBZone program, we\nthink we can multiply the effect.\nSo we live in a city where the ZIP code might determine as\nmuch as a 20-year discrepancy in life expectancy, and so we\nneed bold change now. And so if today is not the chance, the\ntime for that bold change, the question really is when, and\nwhen is it going to be right?\nThank you for the opportunity and the time for my\ntestimony.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Dzirasa follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nChairman Rubio. Thank you.\nMs. Sayles.\nTESTIMONY OF LAURIE SAYLES, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CIVILITY\nMANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS, GREENBELT, MD\nMs. Sayles. Good afternoon, Chairman Rubio, Ranking Member\nCardin, and members of the Committee. My name is Laurie Sayles.\nI am a veteran who served 10 years in the United States Marine\nCorps and am now the founder and owner of Civility Management\nSolutions, a professional consulting firm working within both\nthe government and commercial space, and located in Greenbelt,\nMaryland. I am a member of Women Impacting Public Policy and\nVET-Force, both organizations who have assisted in my growth.\nCivility provides program, project, financial, and grants\nmanagement, training, conference logistics, call center, and\nadministrative support for several Federal agencies to include\nsubcontracts.\nI am passionate to testify because my company was able to\nobtain such clients due to Small Business Administration's\ncertification program. I am certified economically\ndisadvantaged and woman-owned small business, VA-verified\nservice-disabled veteran-owned, and certified 8(a)\nheadquartered in a HUBZone office. Like others, I have\nexperienced this with SBA and the Department of Veterans\nAffairs to acquire certifications.\nMy testimony today will address these contract programs\nwith the hope of providing recommendations to the Committee\nthat will assist during the reauthorization process, as well as\nenable the SBA to increase assistance to veteran and women\nsmall business owners.\nI have always been an entrepreneur. As a Marine,\nleadership, integrity, teamwork, and persistence became a way\nof life, which is essential in business. I earned the respect\nas an African-American woman in a man's world, and now am an\noutspoken advocate for veterans as I was elected as the first\nwoman officer on the VET-Force Committee. In this role, I\nlisten to many veteran small business owners on their\nfrustrations to ascertain VA certifications and opportunities\nwithin the VA.\nReturning to civilian life can be difficult. It is a\nprocess, it takes to adjust, and working with government\nagencies can become frustrating, especially understanding the\nmany regulations and rules. While a change in the 2017 NDAA\nmade much-needed improvements to the verification of veterans,\nsignificant issues of concern still remain. They are detailed\nin my written statement, but to name a few they are the\nrequirements around military spouse participation and veterans\nnot being located within a reasonable commute from job sites.\nThere is a rebuttal presumption that he or she does not control\nthe firm. However, I am very grateful for the VIP program in\nMaryland that trains military veterans in government\ncontracting which Barbara Ashe spearheaded.\nWhile I am also a woman-owned business, my fellow panelists\nalready touched on this program, so I will use the remaining\ntime to talk about the 8(a) business development program.\nCivility obtained the 8(a) certification after being in\nbusiness for four years. I utilized my local SCORE chapter for\nsupport. Do note, though, that the SBA Office of the Inspector\nGeneral reported that since 2010, there has been a consistent\ndecline in the number of small business owners participating in\nthe 8(a) program. There are many potential reasons for the\ndecrease in participation, but I would like to highlight a few\nchanges that would help.\nThe first is the requirement of the administrator to\napprove the sale of an 8(a) firm, or transfer of 8(a) contracts\nto another eligible 8(a) concern. This should be removed.\nObtaining the administrator's approval seems burdensome and\nunnecessary. Unfamiliarity and--my apologies.\nRecently, Civility was accepted in a pilot program referred\nto as the 8(a) Accelerator, that was established by the Bowie\nBIC University in Prince George's County, Maryland, to help\ntrain up 8(a) firms, and the SBA Washington District office\ncollaborated in its development. The Business Opportunity\nSpecialists can only provide procurement assistance to 8(a)\nfirms, and Congress should explore expanding their portfolios\nto include all SBA certifications, and the government would see\ntangible results.\nI lost a page and I am going to have to just move on.\nCreating a pathway forward for all certified companies to\nthrive in their businesses is important. However,\naccountability and proper implementation of SBA's contracting\nprograms is necessary, and to ensure a level playing field. The\ngovernment met its 5 percent goal of contracting with women\nonce, and has never met its HUBZone goals. I urge the Committee\nto think big when it comes to reauthorizing contracting\nprograms in order to strengthen small business growth.\nThis concludes my testimony and I am happy to answer any\nquestions.\n[The prepared statement of Ms. Sayles follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nChairman Rubio. Thank you. I am going to defer to the\nRanking Member.\nSenator Cardin. Let me thank all of our witnesses. Very,\nvery helpful. I am glad that you are here, by the way. You\nbelong here. I had a chance to be with Fearless Solutions and\nthe work that you do in helping SBA with the HUBZones is an\nimportant contribution, and it is great to see a small business\nowner doing that.\nAnd it is good to see a graduate from the VIP program that\nis here. One of the things that we talk about, Mr. Chairman, is\nproviding the technical help and assistance so that, whether it\nis a veteran-owned business or whether it is a women-owned\nbusiness or whether it is a disadvantaged 8(a) business, that\nthey have the technical help in order to understand how\nentrepreneurship can work to their advantage and they can get\ncontracts. The VIP program, which started in Montgomery County,\nby the Chamber, in which Ms. Sayles is a graduate, has been\nnow, I think, a national model, and the SBA is working with\nthem to be able to give that type of technical assistance to\nveterans so that they understand how they can use the tools\nthat are available under the SBA.\nBut I want to get to the issues that all three of you have\nraised, one way or the other, and that is how these programs\nare working. The rule of two, which does not apply to 8(a) but\ndoes apply to the women-owned small businesses, HUBZones, and\nto the veteran businesses, Ms. Marino, I think you said that is\na real impediment to the programs that require the rule of two.\nAre you all finding that to be the case, that because of the\nrequirements of having at least two businesses that it prevents\nsole-source from really working for its intended purpose?\nMr. Sayles. I would like to speak on this, sir. When I\nstarted Civility Management Solutions I had managed 128\nemployees, about $11.5 million, through seven different\nagencies. I had great relationships. They knew that I brought\ngreat work, that I could manage staff. However, as a woman-\nowned small business that had no added value for me. It took me\nto obtain, actually, the 8(a) program, of certified within four\nyears, that opened up the door, because they could not get to\nme, even though there was the opportunity through the Woman-\nOwned Small Business with a sole source. But yet I did not have\nthe past performance to compete, so that is when the\nopportunity actually opened, was when I got 8(a), not because I\nwas woman-owned.\nMr. Dzirasa. I would like to echo that sentiment as well.\nSaying we are HUBZone, both HUBZone and 8(a), received our\nHUBZone certification prior to our 8(a) certification, we have\nhad the same issue, where 8(a) just becomes the easy path,\nright. When there is a requirement and they need to get a\nrequirement done very quickly, it becomes a very fast way for\nthem to get the requirement awarded. And so even with the\nHUBZone, people still, in lieu of that, would do the 8(a) award\nand then double-count and get credit for both the 8(a) and\nHUBZone, but not doing the HUBZone direct.\nMs. Marino. I was awarded a rather good-sized sole-source\ncontract from the U.S. Army out of the 410 Contracting Command\nout of San Antonio, Texas, for SOUTHCOM. It was a $1.8 million\nsole-source project. And the only reason that I was awarded\nthat is because I brought information to the contracting\nofficer, and taught her what the FAR allowed her to do, and I\nwas the only company that could perform, because I live in Key\nWest and my company is in Key West, from Key West to Miami.\nThere were no other companies that could meet this requirement.\nIt was a mechanical contract, air conditioning.\nAnd she had pushback from her command in San Antonio, you\nknow, telling her that she could not award this sole source to\na woman-owned small business. And she said, ``Yes, I can. Here\nis the FAR and I am going to do it.'' And so she really had to\neducate her command on the regulations that she had the\nauthority to do this, and they agreed, and she did award it.\nBut had there been another woman-owned mechanical company with\nthe same capacity and past performance that I had in my town,\nthen she probably would not have been able to award it to me on\na sole-source basis.\nSo, yeah, there isn't one because we are a small town, but\nthat would hurt.\nSenator Cardin. And under the set-aside, the sole source\nunder 8(a) does not have that same burden.\nMs. Marino. That is correct. That is correct. She has the\nauthority.\nSenator Cardin. So when you say you want uniformity, I take\nit you would like uniformity based upon the 8(a) rules on----\nMs. Marino. Well, for all of the socioeconomic set-aside.\nSenator Cardin. Right.\nMs. Marino. Why are they different?\nSenator Cardin. But you want us to comply to the standard\n8(a) on sole source. Is that----\nMs. Marino. Yes. That is what we are saying, and that would\nhelp with certification too. It is already there. It would\nstreamline everything. We all agree.\nSenator Cardin. And another matter we are looking at is\nincreasing the dollar thresholds and to remove the option years\nin the calculation. Do you find that to be an impediment in\nregards to the benefits of these programs?\nMs. Marino. Can you--I do not understand the question.\nSenator Cardin. The thresholds that are there----\nMs. Marino. Right.\nSenator Cardin [continuing]. Apply to each year and the\noption years, so, therefore, if you have a five-year potential\ncontract the threshold is actually one-fifth of the full\namount. There is interest in increasing that threshold because\nof the dollar amounts of these contracts. I did not know if\nthat affected any of your businesses or not.\nMr. Dzirasa. I think so. We have seen that particular\nissue, where obviously 8(a)s are easier to award. And if they\ncan stretch them out then they just have to go back and\ncontinue to renew option after option after option. And so the\nability to have a larger threshold allows them to give more\nroom and more capacity on particular contracts.\nWe have found, in some cases, they just say the ceiling\njust is not large enough. We have to put it on a different\nvehicle, or we have to compete it, and so that delays their\nprocess. So I do think it would greatly help with the increase\nof capacity and the value of contracts.\nSenator Cardin. I would think there might also be a problem\nwith a smaller number of year contract in order to comply with\nthe cap, whereas if the option years do not count towards the\ncap you do have the predictability of a longer-term commitment\nwithout being penalized, because of the dollar amount.\nThank you all very much.\nMs. Marino. Thank you.\nChairman Rubio. Thank you. All right. Ms. Marino, let me\nask you. I understand you were the person to be awarded a sole-\nsource contract under the Women-Owned Program.\nMs. Marino. Well, out of the U.S. Army, from SOUTHCOM. I do\nnot think it was the first sole-source contract ever awarded,\nbut for that agency and that contracting command it was.\nChairman Rubio. How were you able to win that award, and\nwhat can SBA or Federal agencies do to help more women-owned\nbusinesses win these types of awards?\nMs. Marino. Well, I had to educate the contracting officer\nas to the clauses in the FAR that allowed her the authority to\nsole-source this to my firm, and I got that information from\nbeing a member of WIPP. They supported all the women-owned\nsmall businesses, gave us basically instructions on what to\ntell the contracting officer and show them their authority in\nthe FAR. So the contracting officer was not really aware of it,\nso education, I think, for the contracting officers would be\nhelpful.\nThere was pushback, as I mentioned before, from the\ncommand, the contracting command. Even they did not realize\nthat there was sole-source authority for the contracting\nofficer. So they did not realize it either.\nI think it would also be helpful, not only education for\nthe contracting officers but also reward for the contracting\nofficers for achieving the goals, the Federal goals. There does\nnot seem to be any way to recognize contracting officers that\nare doing a great job and hitting all the goals. There is\njust--it is sort of--it does not seem to be any system of\nrewarding that contracting officer for doing a good job.\nChairman Rubio. I think it just touches on something we\nmentioned earlier, is that the contracting officers of the\nvarious agencies and Federal entities are not even aware----\nMs. Marino. Right.\nChairman Rubio [continuing]. Of the opportunity to do this,\nwhich is obviously an impediment to the program moving forward.\nI think, more broadly, I guess just as a broad question,\nyou know, why is it important to be certified--for you, for\nyour business to have been certified in these two women-owned\nsmall business categories? I think you have already answered\nthis somewhat in describing this opportunity, but did it\nincrease contracting opportunities or unique resources?\nMs. Marino. Being certified 8(a) opened up a world of\nopportunity for me through the Small Business Administration.\nSmall Business Administration guaranteed my loans. The Small\nBusiness Administration helped me with guaranteeing my bonds,\nwhich is required in construction contracting. They provided\ntraining. There was so much that I got from the SBA by being an\n8(a) contractor.\nI think it is important that WOSB contractors are also\ncertified by the SBA to not only get SBA support, which is just\ncritical for growth and for success, but also it eliminates\nfraud. I think that the same sort of rigorous background check\nthat the woman is really running the company, working day-to-\nday, signing the contracts, signing the checks, getting in the\nfield, doing the work is critical. It is not just a front for\nanother business. So I think certification is really critical.\nChairman Rubio. Mr. Dzirasa, we have talked in this\nCommittee, in previous hearings, about deficiencies in\ntechnology broadly hampering the SBA's ability to manage\nprograms, but in particular the HUBZone program. In 2004, the\nGAO found that the HUBZone map, the SBA's primary way of\ncommunicating HUBZone locations to the public, was out of date.\nIt was inaccurate. In 2013, the inspector general also found\ndiscrepancies in the historical map data, which the SBA keeps\non a series of Excel spreadsheets. So think about that for a\nmoment.\nI just ask, how were you able to figure out that you were\nlocated in a HUBZone?\nMr. Dzirasa. Yeah. So interestingly enough, when we were\nfirst certified the map was reporting bad data in that\nparticular case as well. The pin was on the wrong side of the\nstreet, and we knew it was a HUBZone. So we had to go justify--\n--\nChairman Rubio. The pin was on the wrong side?\nMr. Dzirasa. Yeah. So it would show that it was not, but we\nknew that it was----\nChairman Rubio. The pin, like an actual pin?\nMr. Dzirasa. Yes, on the legacy map, did not show that--so\nthe address was--there is a HUBZone kind of a square, and the\nbuilding was clearly in there, but the pin when you put in the\naddress would put it here and say you are not qualified, and it\nwould not allow you to move forward within the process.\nThat has been fixed, so we actually know that well. We were\none of the things that helped to fix that for SBA. But at that\npoint it was difficult. I mean, you had to push back.\nChairman Rubio. You had to go find whoever was in charge of\nthe pins and----\nMr. Dzirasa [continuing]. And move the pin. That is right.\nYeah. We had to get the pin moved.\nChairman Rubio. Our work here is done then.\n[Laughter.]\nMr. Dzirasa. But in that particular case, right, if you do\nnot push back, the system would not allow you to move forward,\nand it would not even allow you to start the application at\nthat time. And that has been cleaned up. It has taken, well,\nobviously from 2004, that you mentioned, to we were awarded a\ncontract in 2016, and by 2017, in six months, we had the first\nmodernization MVP out the door. And so I think some of those\nthings are starting to trend in the right direction.\nChairman Rubio. Yeah. And Ms. Sayles, within the four prime\ncontracting programs at SBA there are different processes for\nbecoming certified for participation, as we have talked about.\nYou are in a unique experience of having--you have had\nexperiences with three of these four programs.\nMr. Sayles. Yes, sir.\nChairman Rubio. I am curious to know which of the three did\nyou find to be the easiest and which one was the hardest?\nMr. Sayles. Actually, the Department of Veterans Affairs\nhas improved theirs, because they are also online, but the\nCertify.SBA.gov site has been fabulous. And as an 8(a) firm,\neven going in and doing the self-certification for the woman-\nowned and economically woman-owned small business, they are\nable to pull that information that is already in the system\nfrom me being an 8(a) certified company and apply it to the\nprocess.\nSo some of the questions were ``Are you an 8(a) firm?''\nYes. And based off of that I answered less questions to get\nthrough that certification process.\nSo, yes, and may I add that a lot of veteran service\norganizations are in agreement with the VA certification going\nover to the SBA office, so that they are all housed within the\nsame place, which should also add more simplification to the\ncertification process.\nChairman Rubio. We talked also, earlier in the hearing,\nabout the statutory award goal of 23 percent of contracts to\nsmall businesses. The Scorecard is supposed to measure how well\nagencies are complying with this goal, but as you may have\nheard and seen and probably knew before, GAO reports found some\nissues with this. In your opinion, having experience with\nthese, what does the Scorecard get right and what needs\nimprovement?\nMr. Sayles. Are you speaking to me, sir? My apologies.\nActually, I am not as well versed. I just do know that a lot of\ncommunity, as a whole, in the small business, do question\nwhether or not the Small Business Administration Scorecard is\naccurate.\nChairman Rubio. Based on their interaction with these\nagencies and in terms of knowing what they know about the way\nthese agencies perform----\nMr. Sayles. That is correct, and how the data is collected\nand how it is produced for us all to review it. There are a lot\nof entities of businesses, as well as organizations, that do\nquestion whether or not the data is correct.\nMr. Dzirasa. Yeah. I would like to echo. I also think there\nare questions about the double counting. So if you award a\ncontract to a particular entity that has multiple\ncertifications, they are allowed to count that they have\nreceived credit for all of them, and so it is not clear. If\nsomeone is woman-owned, HUBZone, and 8(a) and they do an 8(a)\nsole-source, they get a triple count. So I am unclear if that\nthen bubbles up into all of those numbers, as far as them\nmeeting the goals or not. So it is unclear how factual that\ndata might be.\nChairman Rubio. And you are not in, obviously, a great\nposition to see every contract that is going out, but I know\nthat there is skepticism among many in the small business\ncommunity about whether, in fact, the numbers that are being\nreflected are the ones that these agencies are meeting. And as\nyou have heard here in the testimony today, because that is a\nholistic number. So if some agency is doing 33, then somebody\nelse can do less, and it often times depends on the types of\ncontracts they are awarding.\nBut I know we have heard great skepticism across that, that\neven some of the reported numbers are not accurate, which is\nwhy the transparency part of the Scorecard is important, so\npeople have confidence that these are the sort of priorities\nthat are being met and addressed.\nSenator Risch, did you have questions?\nSenator Risch. No, I did not. Thank you for holding this\nhearing. It is an important hearing, and I know there are\nissues being raised. I appreciate you doing this so we can\nexplore them. Thank you.\nChairman Rubio. I did want to ask one more question of Ms.\nMarino. You are a participant in the 8(a) program. You have\naccess to--you have talked about this a little bit, all the\ndifferent components on the bonding capacity and so forth that\nhave made you eligible for. You also have access to training,\ntechnical assistance, in addition to being able to compete for\nthe set-aside.\nSince you are active in the small business community as\nwell, would this same type of training, in your view--on the\ntraining part of it, which you may or may not have availed\nyourself of heavily, but, I do not know. Maybe you did. But\nwould that be useful to other contractors that you know from\nFlorida or through the Women Impacting Public Policy?\nMs. Marino. So I did participate in 7(j) training, webinar-\nbased training that the SBA provides at no charge, and I found\nthat that training was sort of elementary. And really what\nhelped me move forward in my career and really gain contracts,\nwhich is the object, right, was really more one-on-one\ntraining, and, in particular, the Mentor Protege Program was\nreally, really helpful to me. I was in the program for two\nyears with a large Federal contractor, and in that two-year\nperiod I learned what to do and what not to do, as a Federal\ncontractor, and I gained from them all sorts of documentation\nthat I needed moving forward, to be a successful Federal\ncontractor.\nAnd the SBA really held my mentor's feet to the fire, to\nmake absolutely sure that they were giving me the tools that I\nneeded and really training me and bringing me along so that I\ncould succeed. And after two years in the program, sort of\nlittle by little I started to fly on my own with small job--\n$50,000, $100,000--that just sort of grew over time. It took a\nlong time but that meant the protege program was really the\nbest education for me, as a Federal contractor.\nChairman Rubio. And I would also imagine that these\ncontracts have a cumulative effect, in essence, each time you\ncomplete one it sort of opens the door to other ones----\nMs. Marino. Yes.\nChairman Rubio [continuing]. Either by reputation on the\ncommercial side, outside of the government contracting----\nMs. Marino. Yes.\nChairman Rubio [continuing]. The building capacity, or the\nability to gain the confidence of those awarding these\ncontracts that you can actually do the work.\nMs. Marino. Exactly. If you do a good job----\nChairman Rubio. I think that is probably true for all of\nyou.\nMs. Marino. Yeah. Good evaluations are everything.\nChairman Rubio. Well, I want to thank you guys for being\nhere and for your patience. We had votes today and we made the\ndecision to ride it out until 3:00 p.m. Otherwise, you would\nhave seen people running in and out all the time. But we are--\nis this our last hearing or do we have another reauthorization?\nWe have two more. Lucky me.\n[Laughter.]\nAnd you do not have to come to those. You can watch. It is\non like C-SPAN 14, whatever. But as we work through this\nreauthorization it has really also been very educational to\nkind of get into the structure of the agency and all of its\ndifferent programs, and find what it does well, hear these\nstories about how these programs are making a difference, but\nalso to identify deficiencies and look for ways to authorize\nthem.\nIn a time when obviously there are a lot divisive issues in\nAmerican politics, small business is one that is not, and I\nhope you sense from the questions here today and some of the\ncomments that I think we have a unique opportunity to do\nsomething here that can actually pass, because it does not\nreally have a partisan component to it, or even an ideological\none. And it is something that the vast majority of Americans,\ncertainly members of the Senate, are supportive of. Everybody\nhas a small business in their state, more than one, obviously,\nand many come from small business backgrounds as well. So I am\ngrateful for your input today because it will make a\ndifference.\nThe hearing record for this will remain open for two weeks.\nAny statements or questions for the record should be submitted\nby Wednesday, June 26th, at 5:00 p.m. It is possible that some\nof the members that were not here or had to leave early might\nhave a written question. If you can answer it, it would be\ngreat. It could be part of our record, and we can point back to\nit as we do our work. Thank you so much.\nWith that the hearing is adjourned.\n[Whereupon, at 4:58 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]\nAPPENDIX MATERIAL SUBMITTED\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]",

CHAD F. WOLF\n----------\nWEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2020\nU.S. Senate,\nCommittee on Homeland Security\nand Governmental Affairs,\nWashington, DC.\nThe Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:03 a.m., in\nroom SD-342, Senate Dirksen Building, Hon. Ron Johnson,\nChairman of the Committee, presiding.\nPresent: Senators Johnson, Portman, Lankford, Romney,\nScott, Hawley, Peters, Carper, Hassan, Sinema, and Rosen.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN JOHNSON\nChairman Johnson. This hearing will come to order. Let me\nfirst apologize for not being there in person. I came in close\ncontact with somebody last Monday that tested positive. That\nindividual is doing very well, with very mild symptoms. I have\nhad no symptoms and tested negative this Monday as well. But I\nam here in Oshkosh and having to do this remotely so I\napologize for that.\nToday we are meeting to consider the nomination of Acting\nSecretary of Homeland Security, Chad Wolf, to be the confirmed\nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which\nis an enormous task. I have stated this in the past. I truly\nappreciate anybody who is willing to undertake such an enormous\nresponsibility.\nI would ask that my written opening remarks be entered into\nthe record.\\1\\ Without objection we will do that.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The prepared statement of Senator Johnson appears in the\nAppendix on page 37.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI will keep it short because I know we have time\nconstraints here. But a quick description of what an enormous\nchallenge this is. The Secretary of Homeland Security manages\n240,000 people in the Department. The responsibilities for\nHomeland Security are vast. I will start with Federal Emergency\nManagement Agency (FEMA), that has to deal with hurricanes and\nwildfire and now coronavirus disease (COVID), amongst many\nother responsibilities. Border security, a huge issue. We have\nnot fixed that problem, not by a long stretch. But this\nadministration has done a pretty good job of stopping the out-\nof-control, illegal entry that we were experiencing over a year\nago.\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).\nThis Department is concerned about cybersecurity, election\nsecurity, security over our critical infrastructure. As we\nwitnessed with some of the protests that have sprung into\nriots, also protecting our Federal buildings, and, of course,\nwe tragically lost David Patrick Underwood in Oakland,\nCalifornia, a member of the Federal Protection Services (FPS).\nAgain, the responsibilities are enormous. I do not envy any\nSecretary of Homeland Security's task. I truly appreciate\nanybody willing to serve in this capacity.\nOne quick word. I do want to talk about, from my\nstandpoint, what an extraordinary job DHS and, quite honestly,\nthis administration has done in dealing with COVID. I know that\nis not the narrative in the mainstream media, and from many of\nmy colleagues, but the fact of the matter is I come from a\nmanufacturing background. I understand a difficult situation.\nCOVID is an act of God, and if you think back to the\nbeginning of this, when we were concerned about running out of\nventilators, we did not. The President invoked the Defense\nProduction Act and we have produced ventilators at a record\npace, and nobody ran out.\nPersonal protective equipment (PPE). I know it was not\nperfect. I know people did not get everything they wanted. But\nagain, nobody ran out, and that was dealing with a very\ndifficult situation where demand outstripped supply by two to\nthree times. We heard that in testimony before this Committee.\nI know the Acting Secretary. I know Pete Gaynor. I know the\nmen and women throughout the Federal agencies that are dealing\nwith COVID. They have been working 24/7, and from my standpoint\nthey have done a pretty extraordinary job dealing with a very\ndifficult situation.\nWhat is unfortunate, someone like Acting Secretary Wolf, I\nsaid the exact same thing with Louis DeJoy in a hearing with\nthe Postmaster General. Not only is it a thankless task but it\nis a task that unfortunately opens you up to character\nassassination as well. I find that very unfortunate.\nPersonally, I want to thank you and the men and women that\nserve with you in the Department for working tirelessly to try\nand keep our homeland secure, keep this nation safe, and\ndealing with all these enormous issues that you are dealing\nwith, day in and day out, like I said, 24/7.\nAgain, Acting Secretary Wolf, thank you for your past\nservice. Thank you for your willingness to serve in this\ncapacity as well, and I welcome you and any guests that you\nmight have brought to the hearing room. If you did, I hope you\ncan introduce some of your family members.\nWith that I will turn it over to Senator Peters.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR PETERS\\1\\\nSenator Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you,\nActing Secretary Wolf, for being here and for your willingness\nto serve. Today we are considering the nomination of Chad Wolf\nto be the Secretary of Homeland Security, and under this\nadministration we have seen, unfortunately, an unprecedented\nwillingness to abandon the norms of Senate-confirmed Cabinet\nofficials. This has been a particular problem at the Department\nof Homeland Security, the country's third-largest agency and an\nabsolute critical part of safeguarding our national security.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The prepared statement of Senator Peters appear in the Appendix\non page 39.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVacancies and acting officials are part of every\nadministration, but they should be rare. This administration\nhas abused vacancies to the detriment of this Department. The\nPresident refused to formally nominate a leader for the DHS for\nmore than 500 days, a move that was not only legally\nquestionable but created chaos and confusion at the agency\ncharged with addressing numerous threats to our national\nsecurity.\nThe Department cannot successfully tackle the serious\nchallenges it faces without strong, steady, and independent\nleadership. While Mr. Wolf has experience at the Department,\nprimarily as a chief of staff but also as an Under Secretary\nand now Acting Secretary, he has been involved in some of the\nmost controversial and concerning decisions the Department has\nmade. These decisions warrant a critical review of Mr. Wolf's\nrecord and call into question whether he is the right person\nfor this critical role.\nUnder Mr. Wolf's leadership, the Department has faced\ndaunting challenges, asylum seekers at our Southern border, the\npandemic, civil unrest, and deadly wildfires and hurricanes.\nWhile these challenges would strain even the most prepared\nstaff, I am concerned by reports of slow decisionmaking and the\nsidelining of experts, reports that raise serious questions\nabout the judgment and independence of agency leaders.\nI am also concerned by how the Department has failed to\nadequately address the rise of domestic terrorism and white\nsupremacist violence.\nAs you can see, I have a graph\\1\\ here behind me. As you\ncan see from this graph, the data shows that extremism based in\nwhite nationalism, anti-Semitism, and other ideologies account\nfor more than 77 percent of domestic terror murders in the\nUnited States. Yet recent reports and statements from former\nDHS employees have indicated that the White House, in\ncooperation with Mr. Wolf, have downplayed this threat in\npublic risk assessments. Rhetoric and political ideology cannot\ndrive intelligence reports, and it should not predetermine the\nactions of any Federal department.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The graph referenced by Senator Peters appear in the Appendix\non page 414.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhile the threat of domestic terror is not new, the\nDepartment's necessary shift from focusing mainly on the\nforeign threats that have dominated the Department's origins,\nor since the Department's origins, it has been 18 years since\nCongress passed legislation to establish this massive agency,\nand so much has certainly changed since then.\nOur country faces persistent threats, both longstanding and\nnew, including foreign and domestic terrorism, election\nsecurity, natural disasters, cyber attacks, and now a pandemic.\nIt is this Committee's responsibility to ensure that any\nnominee to lead this colossal Department has the experience,\ntemperament, and leadership to address these threats head-on to\nprotect the American people.\nBefore I wrap up my remarks I want to take a moment to\nacknowledge the severe toll that the pandemic has taken on the\nDepartment of Homeland Security. Hundreds of frontline\npersonnel have been infected while working every day to keep us\nsafe. We have also tragically lost six Transportation Security\nAdministration (TSA) officials to the pandemic. Our hearts go\nout to all of those who have suffered because of this terrible\ndisease.\nI would also like to recognize a Border Patrol agent who is\nfighting for his life now, after being attacked in Arizona\nwhile on duty Monday night. I wish him a speedy recovery, and I\nthank him and his fellow Border Patrol agents for the work that\nthey do each and every day to keep us safe.\nAgain, Mr. Wolf, thank you for your willingness to serve\nand for being here today to answer our questions. I look\nforward to having a thorough discussion about the many pressing\nissues that face the Department and our country, so welcome.\nMr. Chairman, I would also like to ask unanimous consent\n(UC) to enter a letter received yesterday from House Homeland\nSecurity Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson,\\3\\ outlining his\nconcerns with Acting Secretary Wolf's lack of compliance with\nrequests for information.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The letter referenced by Senator Peters appear in the Appendix\non page 298.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChairman Johnson. Without objection.\nSenator Peters. Thank you.\nChairman Johnson. Thank you, Senator Peters. Now it is our\npleasure to have Senator Ted Cruz, who is going to introduce\nMr. Wolf. Senator Cruz.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR TED CRUZ\\2\\\nSenator Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the\nCommittee for welcoming me here. I have to say, Mr. Chairman,\nas you self-isolate from home this may actually be an historic\nmoment in that this may be the first Senate committee hearing\never with a pool table in the background, as I can see you have\na lovely pool table in your living room. I will say, at this\ntime of deep and contentious division, perhaps if the Senate\ngathered around the pool table with a beer we might be able to\nget more done than sitting in hearing rooms yelling at each\nother. But that may not be happening today.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\2\\ The prepared statement of Senator Cruz appear in the Appendix\non page 41.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWith that it is a real pleasure to introduce Chad Wolf, who\nis a fellow Texan and a dedicated public servant. He is an\nindividual that I believe is eminently qualified to be the next\nSecretary of Homeland Security.\nChad was born in Jackson, Mississippi, but he very quickly\nmade his way to the great State of Texas, and he grew up in\nPlano, Texas. He earned a degree in American history from\nSouthern Methodist University and began his career working for\nnot one but two Texas Senators, Phil Gramm and my predecessor,\nKay Bailey Hutchison.\nChad left the Hill after the September 11 attacks to serve\nour country and to protect us from terrorist threats, going to\nwork at the newly created Transportation Security\nAdministration in 2002. He became an early leader at the TSA,\nfinishing out his first run of service there in 2005 as\nAssistant Administrator for Transportation Security Policy.\nAfter over a decade in the private sector, Chad returned to\nthe TSA as Chief of Staff in 2017, before becoming Deputy Chief\nof Staff and eventually Chief of Staff at the full Department\nof Homeland Security. He has been Acting Secretary of Homeland\nSecurity since November 2019, and in that role he has shown\nstrong leadership. That leadership, I believe, has been tested,\nin particular, by the protests that became riots and the\nviolence that we have seen across the country. Nowhere was that\nviolence, were those riots worse than in Portland, Oregon,\nwhere night after night thousands of angry protesters\nphysically assaulted Federal law enforcement officers (FLEO),\nattacked the Federal courthouse, threw fire bombs, attempted to\nwreak havoc.\nMr. Wolf took his responsibility to protect Federal\nfacilities and to protect Federal personnel with the gravest\nseriousness. He did so at a time when political divisions in\nthis country made it much more difficult to do so. He did so at\na time when the mayor of Portland and the Governor of Oregon\nboth told him to, in no uncertain terms, get the hell out.\nMr. Wolf was not cowed by political pressure. He was not\ncowed by the partisan anger of the moment. He was not willing\nto abandon a Federal courthouse which was still hearing cases,\nwas still in operation. He was not willing simply to hand the\ncourthouse over to the mob and allow them to burn the\ncourthouse to the ground, nor was he willing to abandon the men\nand women who he has been entrusted to lead.\nFederal law enforcement officers faced hundreds of violent\nphysical attacks in Portland, having rocks thrown at them,\nwater bottles thrown at them, having industrial-grade lasers\nfired in their eyes, resulting in numerous serious eye\ninjuries. Having commercial fireworks thrown at them. Having\nfire bombs thrown at them. Protesters armed with guns, with\nknives, night after night after night attacking Federal law\nenforcement officers in a profoundly politicized context.\nI will tell you, I have been impressed by Acting Secretary\nWolf's steadfast commitment to do his job, to follow the law,\nto protect the Federal facilities he was charged to protect,\nand to stand with the men and women, the law enforcement\nofficers who were risking their lives to do their job. I\nbelieve that record, in addition to his long history and\nexperience, qualifies him well to be confirmed as Secretary of\nHomeland Security, and I am proud to introduce a fellow Texan.\nChairman Johnson. Thank you, Senator Cruz, for that\nintroduction and your really powerful opening statement.\nIt is the tradition of this Committee to swear witnesses\nin, so Acting Secretary Wolf, if you will stand and raise your\nright hand.\nDo you swear the testimony you will give before this\nCommittee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but\nthe truth, so help you, God?\nMr. Wolf. I do.\nChairman Johnson. Thank you. Please be seated.\nThe Honorable Chad Wolf is the Acting Secretary of the\nDepartment of Homeland Security. Mr. Wolf was appointed to the\nActing Secretary position following his confirmation as Under\nSecretary for the Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans in\nNovember 2019. While serving as the senior official overseeing\nthe Department's policymaking process, Mr. Wolf led the\ndevelopment and coordination of strategies and policies to\nadvance the Department's homeland security mission.\nMr. Wolf previously held numerous senior leadership roles\nin the Department, including serving as the Chief of Staff for\nthe Department. Prior to joining the administration, Mr. Wolf\nserved as Vice President and Senior Director at Wexler &\nWalker, a bipartisan public policy consulting firm. Mr. Wolf.\nTESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE CHAD F. WOLF\\1\\ TO BE SECRETARY,\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\nMr. Wolf. Good morning Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member\nPeters and other distinguished Members of the Committee. It is\ncertainly an honor to appear before you today as the\nPresident's nominee to be the Secretary of Homeland Security. I\nam grateful to the President for the faith and trust that he\nhas placed in me to serve the tremendous men and women of the\nDepartment, whose mission is now more important and more\ncritical to the safety and security of the homeland than ever\nbefore.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The prepared statement of Mr. Wolf appears in the Appendix on\npage 43.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAgain, I would like to thank Senator Cruz for being here\ntoday to introduce me and for his kind words, but more\nimportantly for his continued support for the Department and\nour mission.\nAs each of you personally understand, service to one's\ncountry means dedication, hard work, and commitment. That\ndedication often means less personal time with family and loved\nones, which is a sacrifice felt by all of us in public service.\nFor many years, my family has made tremendous sacrifices so\nthat I could serve our Nation. I would like to take this time\nto recognize them for their ongoing encouragement, patience,\nand support as I continue my journey at the Department.\nPlease allow me to introduce my wife of 16 years, Hope. She\nis my rock and without her I would not be here today. I would\nalso like to acknowledge our two children, Tucker and Preston,\nwho keep me grounded and focused on the important things in\nlife like Little League. Without their support, I would not be\nhere today.\nI would like to recognize my parents, Jim and Cinda, who\nare unable to travel to D.C. today, but who are proudly\nwatching these proceedings in real time. From an early age they\ninstilled in me a sense of service and commitment and they have\nbeen immensely supportive of my desire to pursue public service\nthroughout my career.\nI would also like to thank the Members of this committee\nand their staffs for the important work that you do each day. I\nhave had the privilege to meet many of you throughout the past\nseveral years, and if confirmed I look forward to the\nopportunity of continuing to work closely together to advance\nthe mission of the Department.\nFinally, I would like to thank the DHS workforce for what\nthey do every day keeping the homeland safe and secure. Most\nAmericans do not understand the sacrifices they make, the\nunfair criticism that they endure, and the complexities of\ntheir job. But from one employee to another I say thank you for\nyour service.\nLike many Americans, my personal call to service began on\nSeptember 11th, when I was congressional staffer here on\nCapitol Hill. At that time, I had no idea that the events of\nthat morning would forever shape my future as well as the\nfuture of our Nation.\nHeeding the call to service, I joined, again, as Senator\nCruz indicated, the Transportation Security Administration, the\nvery agency tasked with securing our airways and for ensuring\nthat another event like 9/11 never happened again. I was proud\nto serve at TSA during its inception as well as its integration\ninto the larger Department.\nOver the past several years, I have held several positions\nat DHS, including, among others, as the Department's Chief of\nStaff, Assistant Secretary, and Under Secretary position, as\nwell as the current Acting Secretary position.\nOver the past 10 months, while serving as the Acting\nSecretary, our nation and the Department has experienced some\nof the most difficult challenges of our lifetime, but I could\nnot be prouder of the accomplishments we have achieved. We have\nfaced a global pandemic head-on and led the Federal\nGovernment's unprecedented response efforts to include the\ncoordinated distribution of billions of items of life-saving\nPPE.\nWe have aggressively pushed back against malign foreign\nactors and nation-states who have sought to interfere in our\nelections, and we have worked together with all 50 States and\nterritories to protect our election infrastructure. We have\nbeen tireless in our efforts because we believe that free and\nfair elections are the foundation of our democracy.\nWe have taken extraordinary measures to protect the\nAmerican people from a broad array of threats, to include\nhomegrown violent extremists (HVE), domestic violent\nextremists, human traffickers, transnational organized crime\n(TOC), illegal narcotics, COVID-19 fraud, and more.\nWe have stood firm against civil unrest and violence, much\nof which had been directed toward our nation's Federal\nproperties and law enforcement officers themselves. The\nDepartment has surged resources as needed, provided mutual aid\nto State and local partners as appropriate, and has done so\nwith the respect and professionalism I have come to expect from\nthe dedicated men and women of DHS law enforcement.\nFinally, we are supporting our State and local partners as\nthey continue to combat historic wildfires and prepare and\nrecover from numerous hurricanes.\nAgainst each of these challenges, the Department has\nmarshaled our assets, exercised our authorities, and unified\nour efforts to safeguard the American people and our way of\nlife. But despite the challenges of today, our eyes are\nremaining firmly on the horizon. As the strategies of our\nenemies evolve, DHS will adapt at every turn to defeat those\nwho seek to do our nation harm.\nAs the men and women of DHS can attest, our mission is\nanything but simple or easy. It is one that is increasingly\ncomplex and expansive, one that transcends borders, mission\nsets, and threat streams. Answering the call, often in the most\narduous of environments and difficult of circumstances, has\nbeen my sole focus since day one.\nIt has been the greatest honor of my life to serve\nalongside the 240,000 men and women of the Department, and if I\nam fortunate enough to be confirmed, I look forward to\ncontinuing our progress to secure and protect the lives of all\nAmericans. Thank you.\nChairman Johnson. Thank you, Acting Secretary Wolf, and\nagain, thank you for your service. I also want to express my\nsincere gratitude to your wife and your children. I am sure\nthey do not see you a whole lot, particularly not since you\nstarted serving this role. Thank you very much.\nThere are three questions the Committee asks of every\nnominee, for the record, so let me ask you to respond to each\none.\nNo. 1, is there anything you are aware of in your\nbackground that might present a conflict of interest with the\nduties of the office to which you have been nominated?\nMr. Wolf. No.\nChairman Johnson. Do you know of anything, personal or\notherwise, that would in any way prevent you from fully and\nhonorably discharging the responsibilities of the office to\nwhich you have been nominated?\nMr. Wolf. No.\nChairman Johnson. Do you agree, without reservation, to\ncomply with any request or summons to appear and testify before\nany duly constituted committee of Congress if you are\nconfirmed?\nMr. Wolf. Yes.\nChairman Johnson. Frequently I will reserve my time and\npass the questioning, but maybe it is because I have been the\ntarget of a number of false allegations here over the last few\nweeks and months, I know you are having to endure many charges\nas well. I am going to basically give you my time to address\nfour current attacks against you or your office. I will list\nthem and then you can respond to each of the four.\nFirst, if you would respond to the allegations about the\norder of succession issue, if you could respond to some charges\nabout events occurring at an U.S. Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement (ICE) detention facility, if you could respond to a\nwhistleblower complaint from Brian Murphy, the former Acting\nUnder Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis (I&A), and then\njust today a brand new charge about contracts that were let out\nby DHS to your wife's firm.\nIf you can just take your time, take as much time as you\nwant, and just address these for the Committee, please.\nMr. Wolf. Thank you, Chairman. I will take those in order.\nWe are certainly aware of the Government Accountability Office\n(GAO's) opinion regarding the order of succession at the\nDepartment. I will say that we very strongly disagree with that\nopinion. I will continue to say I respect the role that GAO\nplays, but that, again, does not dismiss the fact that we\nbelieve they have a faulty decision, and the legal logic that\nthey used is very inaccurate.\nWe will continue to talk about that. That is a nonbinding\ndecision that the GAO has made. Again, we will continue to\nstate our position. We have stated it pretty emphatically,\nabout that, and so we will continue to operate as we have,\nusing our existing authorities, using our authorities under the\nHomeland Security Act (HSA) to designate successors. The\nDepartment has unique authority to do that. We did that, in\nthis case, not under the Vacancy Reform Act but under the HSA,\nwhich, again, GAO did not comment on. That is the first one.\nThe ICE whistleblower complain, let me just say at the\noutside whether it is the ICE whistleblower complaint or any\nwhistleblower complaint, we take whistleblowers very seriously.\nThey have certain right, and we are going to certainly make\nsure that those investigations by the Office of Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) are played out, and we will be fully cooperative\nwith that.\nRegarding the ICE whistleblower complaint, it is my\nunderstanding that the OIG has individuals on the ground in\nthat facility in Georgia. They will be talking with those\nindividuals today and tomorrow. I look forward to that\ninvestigation. Some of what we have seen thus far on some of\nthe most, I would say, dramatic allegations in that complaint\nregarding certain medical procedures, some of the facts on the\nground and the facts that we have seen do not back up those\nallegations. But again, I am going to let the OIG process play\nout.\nBut if there is a kernel of truth to any of that, you can\nguarantee that I will hold those accountable and will take very\ndecisive action. But at this point they are allegations and we\nneed to make sure that we fully investigate them so that all\nsides have a chance to be heard.\nRegarding the intelligence and analysis whistleblower\ncomplaint from Mr. Murphy, it is patently false. It is a\nfabrication, completely. I reject any claim that I attempted to\ninfluence or retaliate against any individual at DHS, but\nspecifically Mr. Murphy. I removed or reassigned Mr. Murphy at\nthe beginning of August for a very specific reason, that I\nissued a statement on it, I talked about it in the media. It\nwas very clear.\nBecause I had received credible allegations that he abused\nhis position, he abused his authority, and possibly violated\nnumerous legal requirements when he personally directed the\ncollection of information on U.S. journalists. I have referred\nthat to the OIG. There is an OIG investigation. I told him at\nthe time that I needed to reassign him to ensure that that\nprocess, that investigation could go on through I&A without any\nappearance of influence by him leading that organization.\nObviously he disagreed with that, and we see what is occurring\nat the time.\nFor me it was a bright line. If there was even any\nindication that information was being collected on journalists\nI had to take that action before any type of investigation was\ncompleted. I will continue to talk about everything that I have\ndone with I&A, the conversations I have had with Mr. Murphy. I\nam happy to go in further on that as well.\nMr. Wolf. Then, of course, just recently, I think\novernight, there was a news story about some contract that DHS\nawarded to my wife's firm. I guess it was in 2018. I just found\nout about it last night, when the media inquiry came in.\nWhether I was Chief of Staff, whether I was the Acting\nSecretary, the Under Secretary, or any other position at the\nDepartment, I have no role in procurements. I do not even see\nprocurements until they are released, until they are in the\nnews and on the street. If I was involved in procurements,\nwhich I am not, I have recusals in place to not only include\nher firm but also clients that I had before arriving at the\nDepartment.\nSo again, fabricated story. There is obviously no evidence\nof anything, but that is not going to stop folks.\nI appreciate the opportunity to address each of those,\nChairman.\nChairman Johnson. Thank you, Acting Secretary Wolf. Senator\nPeters, I will reserve the balance of my time. Senator Peters.\nSenator Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Wolf, as we\nlearned from the faulty intelligence related to the search for\nweapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in Iraq following 9/11,\nusing intelligence to confirm preconceived beliefs or biases\ncan clearly have some devastating consequences. Trust in\ninstitutions is especially essential when you are dealing with\nnational security issues. It takes years to cultivate trust and\nonly one error of judgment for all of that trust to go away.\nMr. Wolf, my question is, would you agree that accurate\nintelligence reports are absolutely crucial for law enforcement\nand other stakeholders to effectively address and counter\nthreats to our nation?\nMr. Wolf. Yes.\nSenator Peters. Is it true that in July you personally\nwithheld from release an intelligence bulleting calling out a\nRussian attack on Vice President Biden's mental health?\nMr. Wolf. No.\nSenator Peters. You did not withhold it?\nMr. Wolf. I did not withhold it. I asked for the product to\nbe improved, which they did over a period of time, and then\nthat product was released at the beginning of September.\nSenator Peters. It was held for a time. In fact, how long\nwas it withheld before the product was improved?\nMr. Wolf. I saw that product at the beginning of July. I\noutlined my concerns, not with the underlying intelligence. The\nintelligence I agreed with. The intelligence has been backed up\nfrom the intelligence community (IC) and others. It was the\nquality of the product itself that was lacking. Again, any\nproduct that comes out of the Department I am very specific on\nmaking sure that that is a professional document.\nWhen I brought this to the attention of career officials at\nI&A they agreed with me. They had not seen that product before\nit was about to go out. They agreed that it could be improved.\nI asked them to improve that, and then it came back as a better\ndocument, at the beginning of September. Underlying\nintelligence remained the same. It was better sourced, better\nput in context for our State and local partners, and then it\nwas issued, I believe, on September 4th.\nIt took a couple of months for it to--you looked at it for\nit to basically come out. Does it normally take about close to\n2 months for you to bring a two-page intelligence report up to\nthe quality standards that you think are necessary? Does it\nreally require that much time?\nMr. Wolf. No, it does not. Again, I had sent it back to\nI&A, and relied on them to improve the product. At that time we\ndid have a leadership change at the beginning of August. This\nis back to my earlier comments about Mr. Murphy being\nreassigned. There was a leadership change. We had new acting\nleadership that has come into that office that was reviewing\nthat office and reviewing a number of their reports. It was\npart of that process----\nSenator Peters. But you are saying it does not normally\ntake 2 months for a normal two-page report to go through, or\ndoes it take 2 months for it to go through? You are saying that\ndoesn't----\nMr. Wolf. I cannot comment on how long it takes I&A to\nproduce each of their documents. What I asked them to do was\nimprove upon that product. It went from essentially a page and\na half to about 3\\1/2\\ page, and it was again, better context\nand a better product at the end of the day. But I think the\nimportant part is the underlying intelligence did not change. I\ndid not direct them to change it.\nI was focused on the quality of the product itself.\nSenator Peters. I understand that, Mr. Wolf. It just seems\nto be a real long time to do that kind of change, and it is\ncurious that the report was only issued after news broke about\nit. So here we go. A couple-page report does not get out. News\nbreaks that there is an issue, and then suddenly it comes\nforward.\nMy understanding is that there have been a number of\npotentially problematic products coming from I&A. You and I\nhave spoken about that in the past. But is it possible that\nyour staff chose to elevate this particular report to you--\nbecause there are a lot of reports that come out--is it\npossible that your staff elevated this report, that you\nwithheld from release for some time, because it was about the\nPresident's opponent?\nMr. Wolf. No.\nSenator Peters. Not possible. How many intelligence reports\nhave you reviewed and put a hold on?\nMr. Wolf. I have reviewed--again, they do not come to me\nfor approval. We make sure of that. I want to see those as they\nare released to our State and local partners, and I have\nprobably reviewed a half a dozen to a dozen of I&A's products,\nagain, as they are going out the door, to make sure that I\nunderstand what they are, make sure they are up to my\nstandards. Then as we have talked, this one has not. I asked\nthem to look at a number of those reports, this one\nspecifically, to improve on the product. Again, not the\nunderlying intelligence but the product itself.\nSenator Peters. But still, it sounds like a relatively\nsmall number coming to your attention. Will you commit to\nsharing those held reports, including pre-released drafts that\nyou reviewed with the Committee?\nMr. Wolf. Previously released drafts of----\nSenator Peters. Of the other reports that you said you have\nreviewed.\nMr. Wolf. I can go back and see which ones that they have\nsent up.\nSenator Peters. So you will provide those to the Committee\nthat we can take a look at?\nMr. Wolf. Sure.\nSenator Peters. I appreciate it.\nTo your knowledge, has Mr. Cuccinelli ever directed or\nencouraged staff at the Department to withhold, issue, or alter\nintelligence reports to align with the White House's messaging\nand rhetoric?\nMr. Wolf. No.\nSenator Peters. Mr. Wolf, I sent you a letter last week\nasking that you and any staff named in Mr. Murphy's\nwhistleblower complaint, as well as other staff with knowledge\nor involvement in the activities cited in the report meet with\nCommittee staff for a transcribed interview. As of today you\nhave not responded to that request.\nCan I get your commitment that you and your staff will make\nyourselves available for interviews as part of the\ninvestigation into these allegations of political interference\nwithin DHS intelligence reporting?\nMr. Wolf. What I want to say is that we are currently doing\nthat for various committees at the moment, so we have----\nSenator Peters. I appreciate that, but----\nMr. Wolf [continuing]. House Intelligence, we are beginning\ntranscribed interviews. Senate Intelligence Committee has also\nexpressed an interest, although they have not asked for\ntranscribed interviews. We are going through a process. I\nbelieve three individuals have been transcribed, have sat for\ntranscribed interviews in the House thus far. We received your\nletter last Friday so I think we are on the third or fourth\nbusiness day. We will respond to that. I look forward, again,\nto working with the Committee as a whole to make sure that you\nhave the information that you need to do your oversight\nresponsibilities.\nSenator Peters. As you said, I appreciate you working with\nother committees. This Committee has primary oversight,\nparticularly when it comes to your fitness to serve as\nSecretary of Homeland Security. This is very relevant\ninformation and I would expect that you would be willing to do\nthat, and I have today your commitment that they will be made\navailable to us.\nMr. Wolf. Again, I am happy to work with the Committee as a\nwhole to make sure that you have all the information to do your\noversight responsibilities.\nI also want to indicate there also is an Office of\nInspector General investigation into this as well, so we need\nto make sure that we are also providing information to them at\nthe same time. We have multiple levels of review in this\nwhistleblower complaint.\nSenator Peters. I am running out of time here, but an\nimportant issue you and I have spoken about a lot, and I wanted\nto spend a little time getting some direct answers from you\nrelating to work toward dealing with white supremacist violence\nand activities. I showed the chart that was here earlier.\nCan you confirm that the Department assesses white\nsupremacist violence to be the most deadly threat now facing\nour nation today?\nMr. Wolf. I think when you talk about domestic terrorism--\nso I want to be clear on that front. When you talk about\ndomestic terrorism, when we talk about home-grown violent\nextremists, which are folks that are inspired, motivated, or\ndirected by foreign terrorist organizations, and then we talk\nabout domestic violent extremists. Within that category are\nracially and ethnically motivated individuals, and certainly\nwhite supremacist extremists, from a lethality standpoint over\nthe last 2 years, particularly when you look at 2018 and 2019,\nare certainly the most persistent and lethal threat when we\ntalk about domestic violent extremists.\nBut I think your question was all of the threats facing the\nhomeland, I do not think I would agree that, out of all the\nthreats facing the homeland, from nation-state threats to\npandemics to hurricanes and the like, that is the most----\nSenator Peters. Yes, and that was my intent, that you\nanswered, is dealing with those terrorist attacks. That was the\nintent of the question.\nMr. Wolf. I do want to say that it is important as we talk\nabout domestic violent extremists, and we talk about\nhistorically, 2018, 2019, we cannot ignore what has been\noccurring over the past 4 months, when we talk about anti-\ngovernment extremists, anarchist extremists, anti-law\nenforcement folks. It is very important that we continue to\nlook at and address the threat that has been occurring in the\ncountry over the last 4 months.\nSenator Peters. I agree, and just one quick question here.\nI know the Department finally released your public action to\nimplement strategic framework for countering terrorism and\ntargeted violence. A long time coming. It is out now. But\nspecifically, what actual steps has the Department taken, in\naddition to this report, what action steps has the Department\ntaken to reduce the threat communities face from white\nsupremacist actors? I know there are some grant programs out\nthere. Please do not talk about the grant programs. What\nspecific actions has the Department taken, given the fact, as\nyou just mentioned, given the threat posed by white supremacist\ngroups?\nMr. Wolf. Understanding you do not want to talk about the\ngrant programs but that is a big part of what we do, at least\nin the prevention space.\nSenator Peters. Yes, and I am granting that. I am giving\nyou that. I want to know what else.\nMr. Wolf. We also do community awareness briefings and we\ndo other types of briefings that our Office of Technology\nDevelopment and Deployment Program (TDDP) does as well, in\nconjunction with the Office for Civil Rights and Civil\nLiberties (CRCL) and others. So part of our mission is to make\nsure that we are educating folks. We are sharing information.\nWe are also pushing out, probably I believe since April I&A has\npushed out roughly 20 or so products regarding white supremist\nextremism to our State and local law enforcement officers. So\nthose are two of our fusion centers. We are pushing\nintelligence out, but then we are also providing those\ncommunity awareness briefings and the like, and a big part of\nthat are the resources that we put behind that, which are the\ngrant programs themselves.\nSenator Peters. I appreciate it. Thank you. My time is up.\nChairman Johnson. Thank you, Senator Peters. As long as you\nbrought up the issue of domestic terror threats and white\nsupremacists, I will reclaim a couple minutes of my time.\nActing Secretary Wolf, you seem to make the distinction between\nwhat has happened over the last couple of years as it relates\nto the violent extremism and what has transpired over the last\n4 months. Over the weekend I saw pretty interesting videos, a\npress conference put on by the chief of police in Chicago that\nshowed what happened in Grant's Park, where peaceful protestors\ntook a left-hand turn, went into a park, were either shielding\nthe people that then started throwing frozen water bottles and\nindustrial type of fireworks and that type of thing at the\nChicago police officers.\nWhen you were before our Committee a couple of weeks ago I\nasked, what is your assessment in terms of who is really\nfomenting the peaceful protests that then end up in transition\ninto riots? Senator Peters seems to try and link those and\nconflate it is the white supremacist groups. I do not think\nthat is the case. But what do you say in terms of--what is the\nmain thrust? Who are the main groups? What is the main ideology\nbehind what we have seen in the last 4 months where a peaceful\nprotest turned into pretty destructive riots? I do not know the\nexact count of how many businesses were burned in Kenosha,\nWisconsin, but, the city shut down. It has been devastating for\nthe downtown. Can you just comment on who is fomenting that\nviolence over the last 4 months?\nMr. Wolf. Sure, absolutely, Chairman. What I will say at\nthe onset is the Department is focused on countering any forms\nof violent extremists. So let me just say that from the outset.\nWhen we produced the framework that the Ranking Member\nmentioned back in September 2019, we specifically pointed to\ntwo threats when we talk about domestic terrorism, domestic\nviolent extremists. Specifically, we talk about white\nsupremacist extremists, but we have also talked about\nanarchistic extremists. We specifically mentioned again, back\nin September 2019, Antifa and concerns that the Department was\nseeing at that point.\nThis is not anything that the Department has come to in the\nlast 4 months. The last 4 months have certainly highlighted\nwhat we have seen specifically in Portland. I will talk very\nspecifically about Portland, which I have in this room and\nbefore this Committee again, where we had over a 60-day period\nlaw enforcement officers, specifically targeted, a courthouse\nspecifically targeted, a seat of justice in downtown Portland,\nspecifically tried to be burned down. The intel that we\nreceived out of Portland, that we received elsewhere across the\ncountry as well, has this anarchist sort of ideology.\nBut I want to be clear, and I believe Director Ray has made\nit clear from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), is we\ndo not look at specific groups. We are looking at the\ncriminality coming out of the activities of groups. We are\nlooking at the criminal activity, and of course the FBI is the\nlead investigator of any type of criminal activity that is\ncoming out.\nWhat we saw in Portland was night after night after night\ncriminal activity occurring at that courthouse against law\nenforcement officers and against that courthouse, which is\nprotected by DHS. So specifically in Portland we saw 3, 4\nmonths of activity being organized. It was coordinated. It was\nnot spontaneous every night. That is what we saw very\nfirsthand. We have seen that in other communities around the\ncountry as well.\nChairman Johnson. Thank you, Acting Secretary Wolf. Let me\njust give the Members the order of questioning. Senator\nPortman, then Hassan, then Lankford, then Rosen, then Scott,\nthen Romney. Senator Portman, are you available?\nOPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR PORTMAN\nSenator Portman. I am, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much\nfor holding the hearing, and Secretary Wolf, as you and I\ntalked about in our conversation recently, I appreciate your\nservice. This is a tough time for our country in many respects.\nCOVID-19, the demonstrations and rioting that we have seen. You\nare in the middle of it. Our condolences from this entire\ncommittee go to the family and to the colleagues of Dave\nUnderwood, a Federal Protective Service officer who was killed\noutside the Oakland courthouse in California.\nYou have lost a couple of officers recently to COVID-19\ncontracted on duty, Marco Gonzalez and Lucas Saucedo, and we\nthink of them too, and then recently another officer injured\nalong the border.\nThese men and women are doing the work for all of us, who\nmake our country safer and more secure. Your people are also\nresponding to the wildfires in California and throughout the\nWest, and then also obviously the recent hurricane.\nSo you are in the middle of a lot, and I think it is really\nimportant that we have confirmed leadership at the Department\nright now. For some time, I had been concerned about the lack\nof leadership positions being filled, not just at the top, but\nthrough the ranks. I know the Chairman shares that concern as\ndoes the Ranking Member and we have been working on it. But we\nneed a confirmed Secretary. Some had said to me, well, we are\nat the end of the first term of the President. Why are we\nfocused on this? We are focused on it because we believe that\nthe men and women of the Department deserve to have that kind\nof certainty and accountable leadership.\nI am delighted we are having the hearing today. I want to\nget you confirmed as quickly as possible. I also think it helps\nto head off some of these court battles that we talked about\nearlier, which are obviously a huge distraction for the agency\nat a critical time.\nIn our conversation we talked about the whistleblower\ncomplaints. You have addressed those again today. I appreciate\nthe fact that you are taking those complaints seriously, and\nthat you are asking the Inspector General (IG) to complete the\ninvestigation independently and thoroughly. I think that is\nappropriate, and I do not want to belabor that issue because\nagain, it seems like not only in private have you talked to me\nabout this, but in public testimony this morning, you have made\na personal commitment to that.\nYou have also made a commitment to make sure our elections\nare safe, and that is really important. We have already started\nvoting in some States. We start soon in Ohio. We need to be\nsure there is a unified and streamlined Federal effort to help\nour States and our local efforts to secure our elections.\nLet me give you a second to expand a little on that. You\nmentioned it in your testimony, but can you talk about\nspecifically what DHS has done in this regard?\nMr. Wolf. Absolutely. Again, at DHS, when we talk about\nelection security, we are focused on cyber threats to election\nsystems and election infrastructure. Over the past 3\\1/2\\ to 4\nyears, we have been working with all 50 secretaries of States,\nthousands of local jurisdictions, technology vendors, and the\nlike, making sure that our election here in November is going\nto be the securest election that we have had to date.\nObviously we saw the concerns in 2016. We continued to work\nthroughout 2018 and the midterms. We saw 2018 elections is\nprobably some of the securest elections that we have held to\ndate, and we continue to build on that work as we go into 2020.\nSo very proud of the work that CISA has been doing on election\nsecurity.\nWe know in this election cycle, the IC has said that they\nhave not attributed any cyber campaign against any election\ninfrastructure from a nation-state adversary. I think that\nspeaks to the type of work that we have done over the past 3\\1/\n2\\ to 4 years, because at this time, going all the way back to\n2016, there were indicators and warnings that they were\ntargeting our election infrastructure. We do not see that today\nas I sit here today, and I think that is because of all of the\nwork that not only CISA has done, but the entire interagency\nhas done, as well as the work the administration has done, is\ncalling out individuals that we have identified that are trying\nto----\nSenator Portman. Secretary Wolf, can you address briefly\nthe recent report that came out, I think it was from Microsoft,\nabout various countries trying to interfere in the election.\nThey mentioned, as I recall, Russia, China, Iran. Can you\naddress that?\nMr. Wolf. Absolutely. When we talk about nation-state\nthreats to our election systems, we talk about three,\nspecifically. We talk about Russia, we talk about China, and we\ntalk about Iran. They all come about this differently, but all\nthree are a threat. I have been very consistent about that. The\nintelligence assessment put out by the Director of National\nIntelligence (DNI) in early August was very consistent about\nthat. Again, the Microsoft report, Senator, that you mentioned,\nalso talks about all three of those nation-states being a\nthreat.\nI know that there continues to be a lot of focus on Russia\nas there should be, but you cannot do that at the exclusion of\nmaking sure that we continue to address the threats that are\nfrom both China and Iran.\nSenator Portman. What the Microsoft report says is not\ninconsistent with what you are saying in terms of\ninfrastructure not being under attack?\nMr. Wolf. That is correct. They are not focused, or we do\nnot have any specific intelligence that they are focusing on\nelection infrastructure. That is not to say they cannot or will\nnot. But as I sit here today they are not focused on election\ninfrastructure. They are looking at those influence campaigns\nthat we see them----\nSenator Portman. Let me change subjects if I could, and I\nam going to ask you about something we did not talk about in\nour private conversation, and that has to do with your Disaster\nRelief Fund (DRF).\nSince the $600 Federal supplement on unemployment insurance\nended, many people have not been able to have access,\ntherefore, to unemployment insurance, who lost a job through no\nfault of their own. The President and his administration\nstepped in. You stepped in and provided help at $300 Federal\nsupplement on top of the State supplement, per month. That has\nbeen a 6-week program. It actually just ended last week.\nBut you took the funding out of the Disaster Relief Fund to\nbe able to do that. I personally believe that that $300\nextension is good idea. I think it should be done until the end\nof the year. I think that is about the right amount. There is\nno magic number, but that is not disruptive to the labor market\nas the $600 was.\nHowever, my understanding is that the Disaster Relief Fund\nhas now reached its cap. In other words, you set a number that\nwas based on some analysis that left enough money in the\nDisaster Relief Fund to respond to true and actual disasters.\nTwo things have happened. One is we have had a lot more\nnatural disasters, even in the last couple of months. Certainly\nthe hurricanes and the wildfires are at the top of that list.\nSo more demand for the assets in the fund. Second is, we have,\nas I understand it, depleted the entire amount that was set\naside for the unemployment insurance. I have a legislative\nproposal, in fact, offered as an amendment to the CR and we\nwill see what happens, but to try to replenish that fund.\nUnfortunately is not fully replenished in the CR.\nCan you talk about that for a moment? Again, it is not\nsomething I raised before with you, and I do not expect you to\nhave all the details. But my understanding is the fund--there\nis $24.7 billion left in it, and that that is not enough to\nhandle the natural disaster challenges we face plus being able\nto try to extend this $300 Federal supplement program. Can you\ntalk about that?\nMr. Wolf. Yes, Senator. As of today, FEMA has obligated\naround $49.5 billion in DRF funding to support COVID-19 relief\nefforts. And that includes about $39.6 billion in supportive\nlost wages, Senator, which you certainly articulated. Obviously\nthe DRF is also used to respond to a disaster. Hurricanes Laura\nand Marco, about $581 million, Hurricane Sally is $2.4 million\nthus far, and we will see again how that continues to roll out.\nOur balance in the DRF is a little north of $25 billion, so\nthere is still funding inside our Disaster Relief Fund to\ncontinue to address, as you know, hurricane season goes all the\nway through November, as well as to address the wildfires out\nin the West. We do have funding as of today in the DRF to\ncontinue to support--that FEMA has to continue to support\nefforts around the country.\nSenator Portman. Right. My time has expired. Just one quick\nanswer--do we have enough or not?\nMr. Wolf. We do not have enough as we sit here today. Now\nif we are additional hurricanes, depending on size and category\nof those hurricanes, as well as the wildfires, we may have to\nhave continued discussions with Congress and the Office of\nManagement and Budget (OMB) about additional funding for the\nDRF.\nSenator Portman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Johnson. Thank you, Senator Portman. Senator\nHassan?\nOPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HASSAN\nSenator Hassan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member\nPeters for this confirmation hearing. Thank you, Mr. Wolf, for\nbeing here for your testimony, for your willingness to serve,\nand for the conversation we had last week. I will join my\ncolleagues in offering condolences to your entire workforce for\nthe loss of the officers you have all suffered and to their\nfamilies.\nMr. Wolf, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and\naffiliated forces are gaining strength worldwide, launching\nmore than 100 attacks in Iraq last month, seizing more land in\nAfghanistan, and increasing threats on the African continent.\nThis potential resurgence of ISIS in the Middle East, Africa,\nand Afghanistan is alarming, and we obviously cannot ignore it.\nWhat steps has DHS taken to strengthen its counterterrorism\ncapabilities in the event that ISIS continues to grow in these\nregions and pursues external operations against the United\nStates?\nMr. Wolf. Our counterterrorism portfolio is sort of the\ncore capability of what the Department has done over its\ntenure. We have a layered approach when we talk about\ncounterterrorism policies and procedures that we put in place,\nfrom keeping individuals out of the country to identifying\nindividuals as they come into the country and then to make sure\nthat we are removing individuals as we see fit. We do that with\na number of policies. We do that with in close coordination\nwith our foreign partners, we do that through travel\nrestrictions that we have put in place over the years, but\nmaking sure our screening and vetting programs are really at\nthe heart of our counter-terrorism programs. I would say that\nour screening and vetting programs at the Department are\nprobably some of the best in the world.\nWe share that, we share those partnerships with our allies\nacross the world, making sure they have programs like Visa\nWaiver Program (VWP), our automated targeting system global\n(ATSG), our secure real-time platform (SRTP). These are all\nbiometric programs that we share with them, so that we are able\nto share information, that we are able to share that real-time,\nagain, information, so we know who is transiting certain\ncountries and making sure. If we see individuals that are\nreturning from the battlefield, perhaps back to the United\nStates or back to Europe or other places of the world, that we\nare able to identify them and we are able to work together.\nSenator Hassan. Thank you for that, and I would look\nforward to continuing to work on visa security teams as well,\nappropriately balanced.\nI have heard from many constituents regarding FEMA's recent\npolicy statement that personal protective equipment and\ncleaning supplies purchased by schools are not eligible for\nreimbursement through the public assistance program. While\nthese items may not typically fall within the program, schools\nhave been operating under the impression that they would be\nreimbursable during the pandemic, and have acted accordingly.\nIn New Hampshire, the communities of Salem and Londonderry must\nnow find another way to pay for $350,000 in COVID related\nexpenses.\nThere has been a bipartisan outcry, urging FEMA to\nreconsider this position. These are obviously extraordinary\ntimes and schools need this support to help ensure that\nstudents, teachers, and their families can be safe if they are\nable to return to the classroom. Will you commit to reversing\nthis decision and allowing reimbursement for schools who\npurchase PPE and cleaning supplies?\nMr. Wolf. Again, I have talked to the FEMA administrator\nabout this, and this really has to do with authorities that\nFEMA has versus making sure they use that for emergency\nprotective measures versus just sort of your traditional\noperating expenses. What I will say though, is that there is\nfunding outside of FEMA to address some of these concerns that\nschools have. We have over 39 different agencies that have over\n$3 trillion in funding from COVID related packages----\nSenator Hassan. I am going to interrupt you for just a\nsecond, because I know how sparsely those resources have\nalready been spread in my State, and there is nothing routine\nabout needing personal protective equipment and sanitation\nequipment in schools to combat a pandemic. There is absolutely\nnothing routine about that. I would like you to----\nMr. Wolf. The Deportment of Health and Human Services (HHS)\nis distributing again about 125 million cloth facemasks in the\nmonth of September as well.\nSenator Hassan. I appreciate that, but I will also just\npoint out that FEMA led schools to believe they would be able\nto get reimbursed. They have therefore deployed the resources\nfrom other agencies in other ways.\nLet me move on to another question. For months, my staff\nand I have been trying to get updates from the Federal\nEmergency Management Agency regarding--oh, sorry. That was the\nquestion I just asked you. This happens.\nLet me move on to the last question I have for you. With\nless than 2 months until a Presidential election, the Nation is\nbeing bombarded with disinformation and propaganda coming from\nRussia. DHS's own intelligence and analysis shop has said this,\nand yesterday report surfaced that President Putin and his top\naides are probably directing the operation. Based on everything\nyou have seen, do you think that the Russians are seeking to\nadvance propaganda against Vice President Biden?\nMr. Wolf. I think on everything that I have seen, that\nthere are three nation-states that we have to be very concerned\nabout. One is Russia, one is China, and one is Iran, and they\nall have different ways and different motivations of doing\nthis. We have seen what the intelligence community assessment\nhas said again in early August was that Russia looks to\ndenigrate Former Vice President Biden. China prefers Vice\nPresident Biden, and Iran prefers Vice President Biden. So we\nhave to----\nSenator Hassan. But the answer is that that Russia is in\nfact seeking to advance propaganda against Vice President\nBiden. Thank you for reaffirming that.\nMr. Wolf. All three nation-states are.\nSenator Hassan. Because I do have a little bit more time,\nlet me go back to one other issue. We have been trying to get\nupdates from the Federal Emergency Management Agency regarding\nits role in the purchasing and distribution of personal\nprotective equipment. I understand that many of the tasks\nhandled by your Department this spring have now transitioned\nback to HHS and the Department of Defense (DOD). But how\nprecisely is the work being shared and what agency is handling\nit remains pretty opaque. Can you tell the Committee in a\nstraightforward way what FEMA's current role is in the pandemic\nresponse?\nMr. Wolf. Sure. They still continue to coordinate a number\nof activities when we talk about making sure that PPE gets to\ncertain places. I talked about earlier about the lost wages\nprogram that FEMA continues to administer. Again, that is a\nCOVID relief type of activity. They continue to coordinate the\nvast majority of activities.\nI will say, as you indicated, certain activities have\ntransitioned back to HHS as they are medical in nature. As we\ncontinue to fight this, happy to get you more information,\nhappy to have FEMA come up and brief you on exactly what they\nare doing. This is not a secret. It is very clear and we have\nbeen very upfront about what their role is.\nSenator Hassan. I appreciate that, but it has been very\ndifficult, for instance, to get precise information about\nprojections, for instance, on the amount of PPE needed, and\nwhat tends to happen is people say, HHS is dealing this or FEMA\nis dealing with that. I think it is really imperative that we\nbe able to exercise oversight and get precision from you all.\nMr. Wolf. I agree 100 percent. I have to say, as from March\nall the way probably to present day, FEMA has been overwhelmed\nwith the number of letters that they have received, and they\nare processing them as quickly as possible. We are being as\nresponsive as humanly possible. As you can imagine, they have a\ndeluge of letters from Members of Congress.\nSenator Hassan. Right. I know I am over time, Mr. Chair, so\nI will just close with this. The letters from Congress\nobviously should be responded to, but if you have a structure\nin place and clear communication, clear lines of responsibility\nand constant communication with us, some of those letters might\nnot be necessary. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\nChairman Johnson. Thank you, Senator Hassan. Senator\nLankford.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR LANKFORD\nSenator Lankford. Chairman, thank you, and Acting Secretary\nWolf, it is good to see you again. Thanks for being back in\nthis room once again. The last time we were here we were\ntalking about what was happening in Portland and Federal law\nenforcement that was under assault there by the individuals\nthat were rioters that were attacking the Federal courthouse\nand attacking Federal law enforcement. At that time, you had\nsaid there were about 277, if I remember the number correctly,\nFederal law enforcement that had been injured in those attacks.\nCan you give us an update on those on our Federal personnel and\nthe injuries that have been sustained and how they are doing?\nMr. Wolf. We have had a to date about 349 separate injuries\nto DHS law enforcement officers there in Portland. Many of\nthose have recovered, so the bones have healed, broken bones\nhave healed, stitches have come out, and the like. We have\nabout 125 DHS personnel that have eye injuries of one manner or\nanother, from those lasers that were pointed, and we do not\nbelieve any of them will be permanent. There will be some\ndamage, and some of those are still undergoing evaluation to\nsee what is the extent of that damage.\nWhat occurred in Portland in June and July, we are still\ndealing with that today from a law enforcement officer\nperspective. Again, we not only talk about the physical\ninjuries, but again, we talk about the doxing of personal\ninformation that is out there on the Internet of these law\nenforcement officers, and they are having to deal with that\nwith their families.\nSome of the attention may not be on Portland today, but I\ncan guarantee you, Senator, that our efforts at the Department\nis still continuing to support those law enforcement officers.\nSenator Lankford. Would you tell them thank you from us?\nMr. Wolf. Yes, sir.\nSenator Lankford. They were asked to do something by our\nnation to be able to protect Federal facilities and they\nstepped up and did it at the cost of their own blood at times.\nTheir families have paid an incredible price for them to step\nup and do what is right to be able to protect our country.\nPlease do pass on our thank-you to those folks.\nLet me head down South. I have seen some of the numbers and\nthe statistics that during the time of the pandemic the cartels\nhave altered their methods for trying to be able to move\nillicit drugs into the United States. They have changed\ntechniques, they have changed locations, and the quantities\nhave gone up significantly during the time of the pandemic. We\nhave seen this with people that are in isolation, that have\nstruggled with drug abuse in the past. The isolation of the\npandemic has caused a severe strain for mental health for many\nof those individuals and driven some people back into their\ndrug addictions or deeper into drug addiction, and the cartels\nare taking advantage of that.\nWhat are you seeing on the Southern border now, as far as\nthe movement of drugs and how our interdiction process is going\nto be able to protect Americans?\nMr. Wolf. I think there are a couple of dynamics that are\ngoing on at the Southwest border, not to obviously include\nCOVID. We have talked about a new border wall system going up.\nWe have over 320 new miles of that new border wall system, and\nthose are in very trafficked areas that we are putting that\nborder wall system up. So that is causing cartels and\ntransnational criminal organizations (TCOs) to try to find new\npathways, new avenues into the country.\nAt the same time, we have DOD personnel, DOD assets that\nare on the Southwest border. We are moving those to areas where\nwe do not have the border wall system. You have more cameras,\nyou have more eyes, and you have more agents in areas that have\nbeen difficult or historically difficult to patrol. That is\nagain causing disruption to, again, those cartels and those\nTCOs.\nWe are seeing more movement through ports of entry (POEs),\nwhich is exactly where we want to push this sort of illegal\ncontraband. We want to push them to ports of entry, where we\nhave people, where we have resources, where we have technology,\nand it is on our terms on how we interdict these folks.\nNow what we are seeing as we put in travel restrictions,\nbecause of COVID, we are seeing some of their tactics change.\nThey are using and recruiting a lot more U.S. citizens today\nthan they have historically, because we have cut down on that\nland, the traffic across those land ports of entry. U.S.\ncitizens and legal permanent residents can still come freely,\nand so we are seeing much more of that traffic. We are seeing\nmore individuals trying to smuggle illegal narcotics in as\nwell.\nSo we continue to catch more. We continue to deploy more\ntechnology at our ports of entry, our non-intrusive inspection\n(NII) technology, designed to look inside cars and vehicles as\nwell as individuals.\nSenator Lankford. What do you need to continue that work,\nbased on the transition and the flow and the effectiveness of\nthe border wall and moving people to other areas where we have\nadditional cameras and additional inspections? What do you need\nnow?\nMr. Wolf. I would say two things: additional resources for\npersonnel, for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel,\nspecifically the Office of Field Operations (OFO) personnel, as\nwell as border patrol personnel. We have requested that in the\npast, I believe, three to four President's budgets, and that\nhas not been approved to date.\nSome of our fees that we normally see, some of our sort of\nnormal fees help to increase our personnel, as those fees are\ndown because of COVID, less travel, the fees are down, so we\nare not able to hire as many folks that we would like to see.\nWe would like to see more individuals at our ports of entry,\nmore time looking at cars, vehicles, individuals, as well as\ncontinued funding. I know Congress has been very supportive of\nthat non-intrusive inspection program that we have.\nWe are trying to increase our inspections for commercial\nvehicles from a very low percentage, I do not have it offhand,\nupwards to about 70 percent by 2023, and for personal vehicles\nup to about 40 percent in 2023. So continued support and\nfunding for that initiative as well, and again, continued\nsupport for that new border wall system. Again, as we continue\nto put that in places we continue to funnel human traffickers,\nTCOs and others to ports of entry, or at least in areas that we\nprefer to encounter them.\nSenator Lankford. The individuals that are crossing the\nborder illegally, do you see some trend changes from 2020 to\n2019? Obviously, COVID has had a pretty dramatic effect on\nthat.\nMr. Wolf. Right.\nSenator Lankford. The Northern Triangle countries have\nclosed down their borders there. What are you seeing on the\nborder as far as the flow of people?\nMr. Wolf. We have seen a different flow. In 2019, it was\nmainly unaccompanied alien children (UACs), as well as family\nunits from the Northern Triangle. We put a number of policies\nand procedures in place. Today, what we see are mainly single\nadults from Mexico, not exclusively, but that is the highest\npercentage by far. What we have seen, obviously, that sort of\nhearkens back to the 1980s and 1990s of seeing that same trend\nand that same flow. The vast majority almost exclusively are\ncoming here for economic reasons.\nNow, the good news is we were able to repatriate them back\nto Mexico pretty quickly, but the different dynamic that we see\ntoday in 2020 versus 2019, in 2019 folks were coming across the\nborder and they were sitting down. They were sitting down\nwaiting for Border Patrol to come up, because they knew that\nthey would be released within a matter of hours, if not days\ninto the interior of the United States, and that was the goal.\nToday, we see they are running from Border Patrol. They are\ntrying to get away. So that obviously increases risk on Border\nPatrol injuries and things of that nature.\nSo the dynamic has changed, the demographics have changed,\nand we are trying to change with that.\nSenator Lankford. The things that you cover and that you\nhave worked on already, both as a Deputy Chief of Staff, Chief\nof Staff, then Acting Director, natural disasters, border\nsecurity, terrorism, cybersecurity, election security, it is a\npretty remarkable portfolio of the things that you are having\nto be able to manage day to day.\nThanks to you and your team, the work that you have already\ndone. Thanks to your wife and your kids for loaning you out to\nthe Nation. I hope you get a chance to catch some Little League\ngames with the kids as well while you are also getting a chance\nto be able to serve us. Thanks for doing it.\nMr. Wolf. Thank you, Senator.\nChairman Johnson. Thank you, Senator Lankford. Senator\nRosen?\nOPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR ROSEN\nSenator Rosen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, for\nholding this hearing. Of course, thank you, Acting Secretary\nWolf for being here today. Thank you for the conversation we\nwere able to have last week before this hearing. I really\nappreciate it.\nI want to go back to your confirmation hearing for Under\nSecretary position that was before this committee on June 12,\n2019. I asked if you were involved in developing the family\nseparation policy, and you answered me, ``Unequivocally no,\nma'am.'' I asked how you became aware of the policy and you\ntold me, ``Through discussions with staff, discussions leading\nup to the Attorney General's announcement in April 2018.''\nAfter that hearing an email exchange became public in\nDecember 2017. You emailed the Justice Department (DOJ)\nspokesman, attaching a memo with the file name, and I quote,\n``UAC options,'' UAC, of course, meaning unaccompanied\nchildren. You wrote in the email to the other official that you\nworked with others to pull the memo together and that the\npurpose of the memo was to give then DHS Secretary Nielsen,\nquote, ``An idea of what she can do right away versus actions\nthat will take months-plus to implement,'' and I end quote.\nWhen you open the attached political memo, it is called\n``Policy options to respond to a broader surge of illegal\nimmigration,'' and out of 16 policy options, family separation\nis No. 2 on the list.\nLet me ask you this. I asked if you helped develop this\npolicy and you told me no. Is that correct?\nMr. Wolf. That is correct.\nSenator Rosen. You and several others, quote, ``You pulled\ntogether a memo for the DHS Secretary that discussed the family\nseparation policy,'' and this policy was implemented. You know\nchildren were separated from their parents at the hands of our\ngovernment.\nLet's go back over the cover email. You said the purpose of\nthis memo was to give Secretary Nielsen, the DHS Secretary, the\nperson whose Chief of Staff that you were, an idea of what she\ncould do immediately versus what would take months. Is that\ncorrect?\nMr. Wolf. That is correct.\nSenator Rosen. At your confirmation hearing, when I asked\nyou if you helped develop the policy, you did not mention this\nmemo. Is that also correct?\nMr. Wolf. I do not believe the memo was discussed at that\nhearing, no.\nSenator Rosen. Thank you. So let's talk about your memo.\nHere is what it says for the No. 2 policy option. Again, I am\ngoing to quote, ``Announce that DHS is considering separating\nfamily units, placing adults in adult detention and placing the\nminors in custody of HHS as unaccompanied alien children.'' But\nthose children you recommended classifying as UACs were not\nactually unaccompanied, were they, Mr. Wolf?\nMr. Wolf. I am sorry. Can you repeat your question?\nSenator Rosen. You said you were going to separate--this is\nwhat you said in your memo, and I am quoting--you considered\nseparating family units and treating the children as\nunaccompanied. They were not unaccompanied. They were part of\nfamily units. That is what you said in your memo. You called\nthem unaccompanied, but they were not.\nMr. Wolf. Again, unaccompanied as a legal terminology. Let\nme just say it was not my memo. You keep referring to it as my\nmemo. As I said last year that the Secretary, Secretary\nNielsen, relied on not only her operators but also her policy,\nher immigration attorneys to develop policy options. Of course,\nthey did that----\nSenator Rosen. But you were part of the team, and as her\nChief of Staff you have direct relationship and responsibility.\nMr. Wolf. I had direct----\nSenator Rosen. You were part of the series of memos that\nwent on deciding to separate children and treat them as\nunaccompanied.\nMr. Wolf. I had a responsibility to make sure that the\nSecretary was fully staffed. Any time we talk about immigration\nwithin the Department, I appreciate it may sound simple but it\nis anything but simple in making sure that we pull the U.S.\nCitizenship Immigration Services (USCIS), ICE, CBP, general\ncounsel policy office, and any number of other individuals----\nSenator Rosen. I understand, but----\nMr. Wolf. Inside the Department together----\nSenator Rosen [continuing]. I have a Chief of Staff. Anyone\nwho has a chief of staff understands that it a complex job.\nMr. Wolf. That was not my portfolio. It was not my issue\nset at that time.\nSenator Rosen. Let me ask you this question. You have been\nActing Secretary for 10 months. Do you now consider it your job\nto speak the truth to power when utterly abhorrent policies\nlike this get proposed? Do you support ending family\nseparation? Do you stand by that? You testified for that.\nMr. Wolf. As I testified last year, I testified again this\nyear, I support the President's decision when he issued an\nExecutive Order (EO) to stop that practice as the Department\ndid, and we executed that Executive Order, I believe, in June\n2018.\nSenator Rosen. Thank you. I would like to talk about the\nending of temporary protected status (TPS) quickly.\nMr. Wolf. Yes.\nSenator Rosen. Nevada is home to more than 4,000 TPS\nholders and their families. Seventeen hundred of those are\nessential, critical infrastructure workers, meaning they\nprovide services that Americans depend on to operate during\nthis COVID-19 pandemic and they are in all of our response\nefforts, according to DHS guidance. We know what happened last\nweek, the decision to deport a TPS recipients. In light of the\nFederal appeals court decision, what are your plans for\ndeporting TPS holders from the countries of El Salvador, Haiti,\nNicaragua, and Sudan?\nMr. Wolf. We are not taking any measures at this time. As\nyou know, we cannot do that, I believe, until about 52 days\nafter that court decision. Forty-five days of that is allowed\nfor individual parties to appeal that decision. We certainly\nexpect that decision to be appealed. So basically it starts\nfrom that 52nd or 53rd day. We then look at a number of those\nTPS decisions that have been issued. But you are probably\nlooking, at the earliest, 180 days out before any TPS orders\nare enforced.\nIt is still very much in the courts, unfortunately. We will\ncontinue to play it out in the courts, even though we did have\na ninth circuit decision last week. They are still very much,\nand there are other lawsuits, I would say, and other court\ncases, depending on the country that we are talking about\nregarding TPS. So all that is to say there is not one answer on\nhow we are addressing TPS. The decision was made----\nSenator Rosen. But would you consider speaking now----\nMr. Wolf [continuing]. In 2017----\nSenator Rosen [continuing]. Particularly----\nMr. Wolf [continuing]. To end TPS.\nSenator Rosen [continuing]. Of protecting those essential\nworkers that are critical to our pandemic response?\nMr. Wolf. We will continue to look at that. Again, we have\nabout 180 days before there is going to be any action taken.\nBut these are temporary programs. TPS is a temporary program.\nWe litigated, we talked about this in 2017. Policy decisions\nwere made by former Secretaries at that time regarding TPS. If\nthis is a population that the U.S. Congress feels very\npassionate about, very much like Deferred Action for Childhood\nArrivals (DACA), very much like some of these other temporary\npopulations, then I would encourage Congress to find a lasting\nsolution for these individuals.\nSenator Rosen. I would love for us to do that too, and in\nthe meantime we are very short of those essential workers in\nmany of our communities across this country and during a\npandemic. I would just urge special consideration of those\nfamilies who are putting their own lives on the line to save\nothers as we this week hit over 200,000 families whose lives\nare forever altered by the death of someone that they love.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nMr. Wolf. Yes, Senator.\nChairman Johnson. Thank you, Senator Rosen. Senator Scott?\nOPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR SCOTT\nSenator Scott. Thank you, Chairman Johnson. Secretary Wolf,\nthank you for being here. Talking about TPS, twice in the last\nyear I took a bill to the floor, all Republican Senators\nsupported it, which would completely revamp the TPS program,\nwhich, after it expired, would come back to Congress and\nCongress would actually make the decision of what should happen\nwith regard to TPS.\nMr. Wolf. Right.\nSenator Scott. It would immediately have granted TPS to\nVenezuelans, which is very important, especially in my State.\nUnfortunately the Democrats blocked it both times. So it is\ninteresting that, there is this interest in doing something\nabout TPS, but the Democrats do not want to fix it.\nFirst of all, I just want to thank you for what you are\ndoing. I was just down in Pensacola with--FEMA was down there\nwith the hurricane that just hit.\nMr. Wolf. Right.\nSenator Scott. The individual that runs the Southeast for\nFEMA, Gracia Szczech, does a great job. I just want to thank\nFEMA for their efforts. I know they are not doing it just in\nFlorida, but they are doing it around the country, as we have\nhad different disasters, and the people that work at FEMA do a\ngreat job.\nMr. Wolf. I appreciate that. That is-obviously, when we\ntalk about FEMA, we talk about the COVID response a lot, but\noutside of that, their normal every day-to-day work, responding\nto wildfires in California and Oregon, Hurricane Laura in\nSoutheast Louisiana, they are still there, still onsite, and\nobviously, in Pensacola and elsewhere. We are into the Greek\nalphabet on named storms.\nSenator Scott. I know.\nMr. Wolf. It is a very active season, and I appreciate the\nsupport.\nSenator Scott. Yes. I have been up here--this will be I\nthink my 21st month, along with Senator Hawley. I just want to\ntell you my experience with Homeland Security and the people\nthat work for you, they are very responsive. Your legislative\naffairs team is very responsive.\nMr. Wolf. Yes.\nSenator Scott. You get an answer. It is not always exactly\nwhat you want, but I can tell you what. Everybody I have talked\nto, they are trying to be very responsive.\nOne thing I know that is important to you is law\nenforcement, and I just want to ask you how you, I do not know\nif you saw what happened last week. I did a unanimous consent\nthat all the Republican Senators signed off on to just--it was\njust a resolution in the Senate supporting our men and women in\nlaw enforcement. It shocked me, but the Democrats blocked it. I\ncannot imagine not supporting that. And have a lot of wonderful\nmen and women that work in law enforcement and how does it make\nthe people that work with you feel when you see that people do\nnot recognize that they put their lives on the line?\nIn my 8 years as Governor, we lost 51 members of law\nenforcement in the line of duty while I was Governor. I mean,\nthese people are putting their lives on the line every day. How\ndo you think it makes the people feel?\nMr. Wolf. Yes. It is extremely difficult. DHS is the\nlargest law enforcement agency in the country, from Border\nPatrol to ICE to Secret Service and everything in between. We\nhave an extensive law enforcement community at the Department.\nIt is not the only thing that we do, but it is a big portion of\nwhat we do. Everywhere I go and I travel and I get the\nopportunity to talk with those law enforcement officers, the\nfirst thing they say, and they can say a lot of things to me,\nthe first thing they say is, ``Thank you. Thank you for talking\nabout what we do and how we protect the homeland.''\nThey put on a badge, they put on a uniform every day at\ngreat risk to themselves, and now to their families--I talked\nabout doxing earlier--and they are just trying to go to work\nand do their job and protect their communities. When they see\nsome of the dialogue that is out there, and trying to paint\nthem a certain way with a broad brush, obviously there are bad\nactors in every profession to include law enforcement, we need\nto hold those individuals accountable. But when they start\ntalking about law enforcement across the board as being racist\nor whatever it might be, it impacts these individuals. They are\nnot robots. They are humans.\nI try to talk to them a lot about, making sure that they\nunderstand the support that they have at the various highest\nlevels of the Department, making sure that we are supporting\nthem, not only through training and resources and PPE and in\nCOVID environment, but I think a lot of what we do in\nsupporting them is what we say publicly and making sure that we\nhave their back. We need to hold individuals that abuse that\naccountable, and I will do that from my position. But Federal\nProtective Service, and, we have talked about Portland here a\nlittle bit, I do not think most people knew about the Federal\nProtective Service, 5 months ago.\nSenator Scott. Right.\nMr. Wolf. They know about them now. They know about the\nwork that they do being unfairly targeted and the like. I\nappreciate those comments, and I will keep talking very\nspecifically about the law enforcement mission that the\nDepartment has.\nSenator Scott. Thank you for doing that. I had the\nopportunity to visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection\nInternational Mail Facility in Miami, I guess it was before\nCOVID, so I think it was last fall. They went through and\ntalked about how they are trying to combat counterfeit goods\nfrom Communist China. We have seen unbelievable human rights\nabuses. There is an article today. I have not looked at the\nbackground of it, but on top of what they are doing to the\nUighurs, they are doing something similar with the Tibetans in\nCommunist China and it is disgusting.\nCan you talk a little bit about what you are doing to try\nto crack down on goods that are produced with the State-\nsponsored Uighur forced labor, and how you are able to do that,\nand how difficult it is for your mail centers to try to stop\nsome of this counterfeiting and try to even deal with human\nrights abuses?\nMr. Wolf. Yes. I have been to the same mail facility in, or\nsorry, mail facility in Miami, and it is quite an impressive\noperation that they have, as they screen parcels coming in.\nWhen we talk about China and forced labor, the Department\ntook some action recently, along with the administration in\nputting in withhold removal orders for specific companies\noperating in China that have been identified of using forced\nlabor. From a CBP perspective, we can put these orders in place\nthat are actually fairly effective because we simply do not let\nthe product come in. It allows companies that are using those,\nthat have relationships with these companies, they are going to\nhave to shift. They are going to have to adjust. They are going\nto have to make sure that subcontractors and folks that they\nare using in China are not part of this order, or have not been\nidentified as having these abuses, having this forced labor,\nhaving products made from forced labor.\nMr. Wolf. We think that they are very effective. Obviously,\nthere are other things that the administration can do as far as\nsanctions and other activities. But from a DHS perspective, we\nthink that these withhold orders are actually very effective,\nand we are very proud of sort of the piece of the pie that we\nplay there, and we are very forceful and leaning forward and\nmaking sure that we identified these companies that are using\nthis forced labor in China and calling them out.\nSenator Scott. Yes. I just want to finish by thanking you.\nI have had the opportunity to meet with DHS individuals in\nCentral America. I have met with them along the border with\nMexico, and I can just tell you they are a class act, trying to\ndo their job, and they need the support of Congress. Thank you\nvery much.\nMr. Wolf. Appreciate it.\nChairman Johnson. Thank you, Senator Scott. I think Senator\nRomney is next on the list, but I think he might have logged\noff. Senator Romney, are you there? If not, we will go to\nSenator Carper.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CARPER\nSenator Carper. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Wolf, welcome.\nGood to see you. Thank you for joining us today.\nI have mentioned this to you before but I think it bears\nremembering, the name Jane Holl Lute may or may not mean\nanything to you.\nMr. Wolf. Yes.\nSenator Carper. But she used to be Deputy Secretary of the\nDepartment, and she has testified before us in that capacity\nany number of times. I remember once when she said to us that\none of her foremost goals as the Deputy Secretary was to get\nthe Department of Homeland Security off of GAO's high-risk\nlist. She would go meet with Gene Dodaro, the Comptroller\nGeneral, on like a monthly basis, and say this question like,\n``How can we get off your high-risk list?'' They would lay out\nthe steps that the Department of Homeland Security needed to\ntake, and ultimately succeeded.\nI learned the other day from my staff that DHS is now one\nof three capital-level agencies with over 400 open GAO\nrecommendations awaiting action, joining the Department of\nDefense and the Department of Health and Human Services with\nthis high number of open recommendations. Among those\nrecommendations are 26 priority recommendations related to\nemergency preparedness, related to border and transportation\nsecurity, infrastructure, and cybersecurity, among others.\nWe have talked a little bit about this before on the phone,\nbut I just want to gauge your interest in if you are confirmed\nas our Secretary to have the same kind of passion that Jane\nHoll Lute held for these issues when she was Deputy Secretary?\nMr. Wolf. Yes, Senator, and I appreciate the conversation\nthat we had on this. We do have about 434 open GAO\nrecommendations. That is about a 50 percent decrease from a\nhigh that the Department had in January 2011, and it is only\nslightly above our all-time low that we had in September 2018.\nAs you know, and I am sure Ms. Lute said, our practice at\nthe Department is we actually do not close out any GAO\nrecommendation until both we and the GAO agree that it is\nclosed out. So that may not be the practice across the\ngovernment writ large, but that is the practice at DHS.\nI also point to an April 2020 letter that we received from\nthe Comptroller General, highlighting the remarkable effort\nthat DHS has implemented, about 83 percent of all GAO\nrecommendations during the past 4 years, and that exceeds the\noverall average of most Federal agencies. So that is not to say\nthat we do not have more work to do. We do. We get a lot of\nrecommendations given our breadth and our mission, and we will\nkeep plugging along. It continues to be a focus of mine, not\nonly making sure that we respond to the GAO, but also to the\nIG.\nSenator Carper. Good. Thank you. That is encouraging. The\npreamble to the Constitution starts off with these words: ``In\norder to form a more perfect union,'' and the goal of our\nFounding Fathers was perfection, knowing that we would never\nget there, and I think that is a good goal for us in this\nCommittee and certainly a good goal for Homeland Security. I\nwould urge you to maintain the attention and the commitment\nthere.\nSecond, a number of us have been down to Central America\nand with a special focus, as you know, on Honduras, Guatemala,\nand El Salvador, the Northern Triangle countries. One of the\ncountries, among the three, where we are seeing the most\nillegal migration, as you know, is Guatemala, and a lot of\nfolks are coming out of the highlands.\nMr. Wolf. Yes.\nSenator Carper. I asked my staff, when we were down there,\nI said, ``Why are so many people come out of the highlands?''\nThey said, ``They are farmers. They are agrarian people, and\nthey have been going through a series of droughts that have\ndecimated their ability to raise crops, including coffee.''\nMy colleagues know I am a big root-cause guy, and I do not\njust look at the symptoms of problems. I say, ``What is the\ncause of the problems?'' Do you have any thoughts about a\nconnection between the illegal migration of folks out of the\nhighlands of Guatemala and what is going on in terms of our\nclimate?\nMy son, our oldest son, lives out in California. They have\njust been through firestorms from one end of the State to the\nother. My wife was down in Antarctica back in, gosh, in\nJanuary, where they set record temperatures, 70 degrees in\nAntarctica. We are seeing, I think, a record number of maybe\nhurricanes expected to come to our country this year. Something\nis going on here. As it turns out, I think something might be\ngoing on in Guatemala. What do you think?\nMr. Wolf. I appreciate the question. We have done extensive\nwork with the Northern Triangle countries, with the government\nof Mexico and others over the past 3\\1/2\\, almost 4 years now.\nI am trying to think of where to start.\nWe have signed a number of agreements back in 2019, from\nasylum and cooperative agreements to security agreements, to\nbiometric agreements, making sure, from a departmental\nperspective, that we continue to help them from a security\nperspective. Now we work with the interagency. We work with the\nState Department. We work with the United States Agency for\nInternational Development (USAID) and others to help with\nthings like food insecurity. We also address corruption. There\nare a number of other issues that the Northern Triangle\ncountries, the countries that you mentioned specifically, are\ndealing with.\nThe Department plays a specific role when it comes to\nsecurity. We send teams down there. We have had embedded teams\nin Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador--obviously, this is pre-\nCOVID--building up their capacity. Because what we know and\nwhat they have said to me, officials have said to me\nspecifically, is that the more stability that they have in\ntheir country, so whether that is security, whether that is\nfood security, whether that is an economic environment that\nallows individuals to stay there, is best not only for their\ncountry, but for our country as well.\nWe are working as an interagency, as a sort of a full-\ngovernment response, and DHS has a piece of that, making sure\nthat we provide the resources, the support, the capacity-\nbuilding for Central America, for those Northern Triangle\ncountries.\nSenator Carper. Thank you. Five or 6 years ago they had a\nPresidential election where, in Guatemala, and there was a\nnewcomer who was running. He has actually had his own\ntelevision show. He is a very popular guy. His name is Jimmy\nMorales. His campaign motto was ``Neither a thief, nor a\ncrook.'' He got elected to be President. I remember working\nwith him from afar, from down there, from afar, trying to\nmentor him and encouraging him to surround himself with\nexcellent people and not to follow the same bad path that a\nnumber of his predecessors had followed, corruption, that sort\nof thing. He ended up leaving in, maybe not disgrace, but in\njust being greatly discredited. It was a huge disappointment.\nThere is a woman named Thelma Aldana, who was the attorney\ngeneral (AG) in Guatemala, who wanted to run for President. She\nwas in El Salvador meeting with a guy named Bukele, who is now\nthe President there, and figuring out how he got elected\nPresident in El Salvador and how that would help her in her\ncampaign in Guatemala. Then she was not allowed to come back\ninto her country. Could not come back, was denied as attorney\ngeneral. She was death on crime, death on corruption.\nWhy do you suppose we never stood up for her? Not to say\nthat they ought to elect her, but at least to try to encourage\nthe authorities in Guatemala to let her come back and run?\nMr. Wolf. I am not sure I can answer that question,\nSenator. It was before my time, so I am not specifically\nfamiliar with that individual. What I can tell you, though, is\nthat the relationship that we have with President Giammattei's\nadministration in Guatemala is good. They are a strong partner.\nThey understand. They want to continue sort of the agreements\nthat we have put in place with Guatemala, as well as the other\ncountries. They have committed to that and we continue to build\non that progress.\nWhen we talk about the administration there today, they are\ngood partners. We continue to work with them. We think we can\nalways do more. Then obviously COVID has been a challenging\ntime for all of us, particularly the Northern Triangle. We have\nprovided resources to increase their testing, to increase some\nof their quarantine capacity as well. We continue to try to\nsupport them on a number of fronts.\nSenator Carper. All right. Thanks very much.\nMr. Wolf. Thank you.\nChairman Johnson. Thank you, Senator Carper. Senator\nHawley?\nOPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HAWLEY\nSenator Hawley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Wolf, thank\nyou for being here. I enjoyed speaking with you last week in\nanticipation of this hearing.\nLet me talk to you a little bit about Operation LeGend,\nwhich the Department is participating in, which is so important\nto my home State. Just last week with another tragic shooting\ndeath in the city of St. Louis, that marked that city's 195th\ndeath this year, 3 months to go, of course, in a year that\nalready surpasses, though, last year's total, which was itself\nhorrific, 194 killings in 2019.\nWe are seeing a surge in violent crime across my State,\nunfortunately, and across the United States. This is one of the\nreasons why I so appreciate your Department's cooperation and\nhelp with Operation LeGend, which is itself named for a\nMissouri resident, LeGend Taliferro, a 4-year-old boy who was\nkilled sleeping in his home in Kansas City, Missouri.\nCan you give us an update? When you were here in August you\ntalked a little bit about, actually talked at some length,\nabout the Department's involvement in Operation LeGend. Can you\njust give us an update of where those efforts stand?\nMr. Wolf. Sure. Absolutely. We continue to support the\nDepartment of Justice. I talked a little bit about mutual aid\nsupport, as far as from a law enforcement perspective. Any time\nthe Department of Justice, calls up tells us they need\nadditional investigators, so mainly we are talking about ICE,\nHomeland Security investigators that are involved every day\nwith criminal organizations, illicit crime, firearms, anything\nthat comes across the border and has a nexus inside the United\nStates, they get involved in. They are the primary response as\nwe work with Operation LeGend in various cities throughout the\ncountry, to include in Missouri. We are happy to do that. ICE\nHomeland Security Investigations (HSI) is happy to lend their\nexpertise and specifically focus on some of that violent crime\nactivity that is occurring in those areas.\nObviously, Senator, the idea of Operation LeGend is surge\nresources in there so that you can close cases quicker. You can\nget them to the investigative stage quicker. You can get them\nthrough that investigative and prosecutorial stage. You want to\nspeed up the timeframe, because as you know being the Attorney\nGeneral, it takes time to get through all this. And so you want\nto flood the zone with resources to address the issue, and we\nare happy to be a part of that.\nSenator Hawley. Thank you for what you are doing, and as\nsomeone who served as the Attorney General of my State, my\nState's former chief law enforcement official, I can tell you\nthat having additional resources--I mean, we always welcomed\nprosecutorial help, investigative help. I know that Missouri\nlaw enforcement officials are very grateful. They told me that.\nThey have said that on the record. I am very grateful for what\nyou are doing, and thank you for your partnership with DOJ and\nyour help to our local officials, who oftentimes are very\nstrapped for resources. I mean, that is just the fact of the\nmatter in all times, but especially in these times. Thank you\nfor that Federal help.\nI want to shift topics and talk for a second about human\ntrafficking. Earlier this year, the Department announced a new\nstrategy to end human trafficking and recognize that issue as a\npriority for the Homeland Security Department. I really applaud\nthis new focus. I have introduced legislation in this Congress\nto authorize a comprehensive study to determine how widespread\nhuman trafficking is now in this country. We have not had a\ncomprehensive study of this sort in over a decade. I think it\nis time we found out.\nCan you just give us an update on the implementation of the\nDepartment's strategy on human trafficking and what progress\nhas been made?\nMr. Wolf. Sure. Absolutely. This is an area I do not know\nthat the Department has really talked about it in length.\nObviously, we have a blue campaign and again, ICE HSI does a\nlot of work in this human trafficking area. But it is not an\narea the Department has traditionally talked about. I think we\nare trying to change that. We have tried to change that\nspecifically over the past year, but even if you go back 2 to 3\nyears, we have a strategy, as you talked about at the beginning\nof this year.\nIn October we will be opening a human trafficking center at\nthe Department. Again, we are trying to signal that this is a\nthreat. This is sort of a threat line that we continue to focus\non at the Department, making sure that we are applying all of\nthe resources throughout the Department into one center to\nattack this issue head on.\nI can get back to you on the specific updates from the\nstrategy itself, but let me just leave you with the fact that\nwe take this seriously. We are devoting extensive resources to\nit. This is not just a one-off issue that we like to tack on at\nthe end of the sentence. This is an issue that we care deeply\nabout, and we are putting a lot of time and effort into it.\nSenator Hawley. I certainly appreciate your focus on it and\nI think that the Department did so much last year to raise\nawareness about the levels of human trafficking we were seeing\non the Southern border and cartels' involvement in human\ntrafficking, and the horrific details about the use of\nchildren, the selling, the renting of children and how\ntrafficking rings were doing this on the Southern border. That\nawareness, I mean, getting those facts out there and then\ncoming up with a strategy to combat that, I think, is so key\nand the Department, I think, is stepping up to that. I\nencourage you to continue to make that a focus.\nMr. Wolf. I appreciate that. We continued that along the\nSouthwest border with our fraudulent family unit program, which\nis making sure that as individuals come across that border and\nthey do claim to be a family that we hold those individuals\naccountable. We are doing that a couple of different ways,\nRapid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and elsewhere. We continue to\nfind a high amount of fraud.\nSenator Hawley. Yes.\nMr. Wolf. Whether these are individuals and children that\nare being trafficked or being smuggled or the like, we are\nfinding a high percentage of fraud there.\nSenator Hawley. Human trafficking has to be the worst of\nhuman rights abuses. It truly is modern-day slavery. It is a\ntravesty to have it in any form in this country. I applaud you\nand encourage you to continue the efforts to use the full\nweight of the Department to root it out and to bring those\ncriminals who are perpetrating it, whether inside this country\nor outside, by pushing it into the country, to bring them to\njustice.\nLet me talk to you about another form of human rights\nabuses going on in China. Senator Scott mentioned this and I\njust want to follow up. I was delighted to see the CBP take\naction last week by issuing five new withhold release orders on\nvarious consumer products made by companies in the Xinjiang\nregion and one Chinese facility that is widely considered to be\na concentration camp.\nI think we need to do even more. I have introduced\nlegislation that would require all major multinational\ncorporations to certify that the whole of their supply chains\nare slave free. Can you just give us a sense? To your\nknowledge, is CBP currently weighing any more comprehensive\nbans, limits on the importation of goods from the region of\nXinjiang rather than just bans on specific producers?\nMr. Wolf. The answer is yes to both of those. We continue\nto look at not only sort of a regional approach, but also\nadditional producers. CBP also took similar actions, I believe,\nwith a company out of Malaysia several months ago as well.\nAgain, China is obviously a big focus, but we are also\nlooking across the globe, making sure that we hold folks that\nare participating in forced labor accountable. I believe so far\nthis fiscal year (FY), CBP has issued 12 withhold release\norders (WROs), including eight again from China itself. We will\ncontinue to lean in on that.\nSenator Hawley. Very good. Again, I salute your work on\nthat and hope that we will be able to push forward and to do\nour best to root out the sort of forced labor and certainly to\nend any American complicity in it.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Johnson. Thank you, Senator Hawley. Senator\nSinema.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR SINEMA\nSenator Sinema. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate\nActing Secretary Wolf for joining us today.\nI want to focus my questions today on several issues\nrelated to border security and immigration, key issues, of\ncourse, in my home State of Arizona. I remain committed to\nfinding bipartisan and common-sense solutions to secure\nArizona's border and protect public health while also treating\nmigrants fairly and humanely. Strong border security and a fair\nimmigration system should be mutually reinforcing goals, and I\nam always ready to work with my colleagues in a bipartisan way\nto achieve these goals.\nMy first question for you, Mr. Wolf, is your Department has\nnot completed environmental stewardship plans (ESP) for border\nbarrier projects in Arizona, despite local stakeholders\nexpressing significant concerns about the impact of these\nprojects on water and cultural resources. While my office has\nreceived information from DHS that these reports will be\navailable soon, construction began before mitigation plans were\ncomplete. I will note that my office received reports of\ndynamite blasting in Guadalupe Canyon yesterday related to wall\nconstruction.\nDo you believe that ESP should be completed before DHS\nbegins construction on a specific project or it takes action,\nsuch as blasting with dynamite that will have a permanent\nimpact on our land? Could you explain why or why not?\nMr. Wolf. Sure. Thank you, Senator. We continue at the\nDepartment, mainly through CBP obviously, in conjunction with\nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) who is building our\nborder wall, a new border wall system, to minimize or mitigate\nany impacts to natural cultural resources along the Southwest\nborder. I will say the president did issue a national emergency\nto build a new border wall system, so where appropriate we are\nwaiving regulations to make sure that that work does not slow\ndown, is not delayed, and we continue to build a new border\nwall system. That is not to say, again, that we take our\nenvironmental responsibilities very seriously, and CBP\ncontinues to solicit information from the public on how to\naddress environmental impacts.\nNow, as we talked earlier, I believe last week, on the\nenvironmental stewardship plans, those are almost to\ncompletion. Those should be issued in October, and we are happy\nto share those with you, those specifically regarding the 137\nmiles in the Tucson sector. We will continue to abide by our\nresponsibilities to make sure that we are good stewards of the\nenvironment, making sure that we are doing everything that we\ncan to minimize and mitigate impacts to the environment as we\nbuild that new border wall system. But it has been very clear\nthat that is a national security issue, and we are going to\ncontinue to build that new border wall system.\nSenator Sinema. Thank you. I just want to note that the\nreports are not available yet, and yet there was dynamiting in\nthe Guadalupe Canyon yesterday. It seems like there is a cart-\nbefore-the-horse situation, and I do want to note that\nresidents of Southern Arizona have expressed intense concern\nabout this. I hope this is something that you would be willing\nto address in the order in which you move forward with these\nprojects.\nMy second question is a common theme that I have raised in\nmany of our conversations, is the insufficient communication\nbetween DHS stakeholders in Arizona and my office on a variety\nof issues. This includes the border barrier construction\nconcerns we just discussed, but it also includes a wide array\nof other topics like the use of hotels to retain migrant\nchildren, conditions in ICE detention facilities, consultation\nwith Arizona's Tribal leaders, crossing restrictions at our\nports of entry, and the use of Title 42 authority at the\nborder.\nMy office has asked you and your office to provide the\nguidance that your Department uses to keep detainees safe and\nensure that trafficking victims are not returned to danger in\nMexico. I have also asked you to take some common-sense steps\nsuch as having proper back-and-forth consultation with Arizona\nTribes on issues such as wall construction.\nCan you tell me what the specific steps that you have taken\nto improve communication between DHS and our State, local and\nTribal partners in Arizona?\nMr. Wolf. Sure, Senator. I have talked to leadership, both\nat ICE, based off of conversations that you and I have had, as\nwell as CBP, making sure that those lines of communication, it\nstarts at the local level. Obviously, there is only so much I\ncan do from D.C., but I need to make sure that ICE area\ndirectors, CBP, port directors there in Arizona are making sure\nthat they are communicating with their individual stakeholders.\nObviously, I have gone to Arizona numerous times over the past\n10 months, and every time I go I start off with a roundtable of\nDHS leadership, making sure that they understand what my\npriorities are.\nThe top priority, usually in all of those roundtables, is\nabout communication, so making sure that they are communicating\nto their stakeholders why we are putting in a border\nrestrictions at ports of entry and why we are doing what we do.\nWe addressed the issue, I believe, we had with the mayor of\nPhoenix, trying to understand more about the use of hotels for\nUACs. Again, that is a practice that DHS has been utilizing for\na number of years, over a decade. But again, was able to get\nthe ICE director on the phone with the mayor, and I think that\nissue has been resolved as well.\nWe will continue to make sure that we are communicating. I\ntried to meet with a number of Tribes in Arizona. It was\nunfortunately right at the beginning of the outbreak of COVID\nand I believe the reservation was closed at that time. So\ncontinuing to be willing to meet with any and all individuals,\nbut it also starts there at the local level within the State of\nArizona.\nSenator Sinema. Thank you, and I appreciate that. I know\nthe mayor is eager to have constant communication and an open\nline of communication with folks representing DHS in the metro\nPhoenix community.\nMy last question. Currently, DHS provides a migrant who is\ngoing through Prompt Asylum Claim Review (PACR) or Humanitarian\nAsylum Review Process (HARP) with a 48-hour consultation window\nprior to their interview with a USCIS asylum officer. But\nmigrants in CBP custody have inconsistent and limited ability\nto receive calls back from legal representatives or nonprofit\norganizations. Can you talk about how you plan to address this\nissue so that migrants in these programs can receive the phone\ncalls from counsel?\nMr. Wolf. Absolutely, Senator. PACR and HARP are the two\nprograms, I believe, you are referencing. Those are expedited\nremoval programs. Obviously, that is authority granted to us by\nCongress to make sure that we do those removal proceedings in\nan expedited manner. We make sure that they have access to\ncounsel, that they have all of their due process rights through\nthat expedited process, but it is an expedited process, and we\ntry to get that down to a certain number of days. We continue\nto make sure, again, that they have access to counsel or any\nother legal services that they may need to represent themselves\nor their clients.\nBut I think it is important to keep in mind that PACR and\nHARP are part of the expedited removal process the Department\ngoes through every day. It is different than other removal\nproceedings where perhaps that will drag on for days, sorry,\nweeks and months, and there are multiple opportunities. The\nexpedited removal process is again defined by Congress and we\nare trying to do that in a very expedited manner. We continue\nto allow them access to counsel and any other, again, legal\nservices that they need.\nSenator Sinema. Last comment I will make, Mr. Chairman. I\nknow that my time has expired. I just want to note that only 13\nof over 2,000 HARP cases and only 18 of over 2,700 PACR cases\nhave had a legal representative in their proceedings. And so\nthere is clearly a lot of work that we have yet to do here.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.\nChairman Johnson. Thank you. Thanks, Senator Sinema.\nAgain, Acting Secretary Wolf, I want to thank you for your\nservice and sacrifice. I want to personally thank your wife and\nyour kids. They do not get to see you as much as I am sure they\nwould like to. Again, I appreciate that.\nPlease convey not only my personal appreciation but I think\nthe Committee's appreciation to all the men and women who serve\nwith you, working day in and day out 24/7 trying to keep our\nhomeland safe. God bless all of you. We really appreciate it.\nThe nominee has made financial disclosures and provided\nresponses to biographical and pre-hearing questions\\1\\\nsubmitted by this Committee. Without objection, this\ninformation will be made a part of the hearing record with the\nexception of the financial data, which are on file and\navailable for public inspection in the committee offices.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The information for Mr. Wolf appears in the Appendix on page\n46.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe hearing record will remain open until 5 p.m. tomorrow,\nSeptember 24th, for the submission and statements and questions\nfor the record. Like many of our Committee Members mentioned,\nit is important that we have a confirmed Secretary for the\nDepartment of Homeland Security. Acting Secretary Wolf, I will\ndo everything I can to move this nomination along as\nexpeditiously as possible.\nSo again, thank you. This hearing is adjourned.\nMr. Wolf. Thank you.\n[Whereupon, at 11:49 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]\nA P P E N D I X\n----------\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\n[all]",

Mike Crapo, Chairman of the\nCommittee, presiding.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN MIKE CRAPO\nChairman Crapo. The hearing will come to order. Senator\nBrown has been delayed a little bit, but I am going to go ahead\nbecause, as I think most people realize, we had to readjust the\ntime of this hearing so that we could accommodate the fact that\nvotes have been called on the floor at 10:30. That means that\nSenators are going to need to really stick to their 5 minutes,\nand even then we may not get through for everybody, and I\napologize for that. I am sure Senator Brown and I will stick\naround for 15 or 20 minutes into the first vote so we can go as\nlong as we possibly can.\nI will waive my questions. I will not waive my introductory\nstatement, though, and I will start with that right now.\nWelcome, Chairman Powell.\nToday Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will update\nthe Committee on monetary policy developments and the state of\nthe U.S. economy.\nThe U.S. economy continued to expand in 2019, exceeding 2\npercent growth for the third straight year, as the American\npeople enjoy the longest continued economic expansion in\nAmerican history.\nThe labor market is strong, with the labor force at an all-\ntime high of 164 million people, and the most recent jobs\nreport shows that employers added 225,000 jobs in January\nalone, with the unemployment rate at 3.6 percent, remaining\nnear a half-century low.\nWages also grew in January by 3.1 percent from a year\nearlier--and this is important--making it 18 consecutive months\nthat pay has grown at an annualized pace of 3 percent or more.\nAmericans' view on their personal financial situations are\nincreasingly optimistic, according to Gallup trends. Nearly six\nin ten Americans, or 59 percent, now say they are better off\nfinancially than they were a year ago, up from 50 percent last\nyear.\nTax reform in 2017 and right-sizing regulations--including\nunder the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer\nProtection Act in 2018--have undoubtedly helped fuel this\nstrong economy and labor market.\nAmericans are set to benefit even more when considering the\neffects of the USMCA and the Phase One Trade Deal with China.\nDespite this substantial progress, there are several\nexternal factors that could have a meaningful impact on\neconomic activity and our financial markets that need to be\nbetter understood, including:\nThe Fed's decision to maintain a significantly larger\nbalance sheet in the future, including its recent decision to\npurchase Treasury bills in response to volatility in short-term\nborrowing rates;\nThe Fed's future plans to maintain stability in short-term\nborrowing rates, including potential structural, market-based\nfixes;\nThe risks of the transition away from LIBOR to an\nalternative reference rate and steps that should be taken to\nensure a smooth transition and curb risks to businesses and\nfinancial markets;\nAnd, finally, the potential impact of the coronavirus on\nglobal commerce and growth.\nThe Fed has also taken a number of important supervisory\nand regulatory actions that merit attention.\nThe Fed and other Federal financial agencies recently\nproposed amendments to the Volcker Rule that would improve,\nstreamline, and clarify the covered funds portion of the rule.\nThat proposal builds on the agencies' simplification of the\nVolcker Rule in 2019, standing to improve market liquidity and\npreserve diverse sources of capital for businesses while\nstriking the appropriate balance with safety and soundness.\nAdditionally, many Banking Committee Republicans and I have\nraised serious concerns in the past with the agencies'\nsupervisory and examination processes, including the use of\nguidance as rules.\nIn January, Fed Vice Chairman Quarles offered a road map to\nfoster transparency, accountability, and fairness in bank\nsupervision, including:\nTailoring the supervisory framework to better align with\nthe categories developed under the Fed's domestic and foreign\nbank tailoring rules;\nPutting significant supervisory guidance out for public\ncomment and submitting it to Congress under the Congressional\nReview Act;\nAnd other commonsense improvements to the supervisory\nprocess, such as a rulemaking that would cover the agencies'\nuse of guidance in the supervisory process.\nThis road map is greatly encouraging, and I urge the Fed to\ntake steps to put it into motion.\nFinally, there is constant innovation, including in the\nfinancial services industry, to increase resources to unbanked\nand underbanked populations, reduce friction in payments, and\nincrease efficiency in the delivery of financial products and\nservices. Some recent examples are:\nFacebook's announcement of Libra, a new stable digital\ncryptocurrency backed by a reserve of real assets and\nleveraging blockchain technology;\nWork by global Governments and central banks to explore the\ndevelopment of central bank digital currencies, especially amid\nrumors that China's launch of a digital yuan is imminent;\nThe numerous applications of distributed ledger\ntechnologies, including in clearing and settlement, identity\nverification, and cross-border transactions;\nAnd some financial institutions' adoption of public cloud\ntechnologies.\nAs I have stated in past hearings, it seems to me that\ntechnological innovations in this space are inevitable and that\nthe U.S. should lead in developing what the rules of the road\nshould be.\nDuring this hearing, I look forward to hearing your\nthoughts, Mr. Chairman, on these important issues and about\nwork that the Fed is engaged in to appropriately address them.\nAnd, again, thank you for joining us today.\nSenator Brown.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR SHERROD BROWN\nSenator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Powell,\nnice to have you back and thank you for your accessibility and\nthe conversations you have with all of us in both parties on\nthis Committee.\nBefore we start, I want to stay a few words about what\nhappened last night, when we got word that Jessie Liu's\nnomination had been withdrawn. She was to appear in front of\nthis Committee or was going to appear in front of the Senate\nwhen President Trump withdrew her nomination. She was going to\nappear in front of this Committee tomorrow.\nI heard some of you, my colleagues and my friends, say that\nthe President would be chastened by impeachment. Some of you\ntold me you knew what the President did was wrong. Some of you\nprivately told me how much you think he lies. But you also said\npublicly that was not enough to rise to the level of removal\nfrom office, and many of you asserted that he had learned his\nlesson, he would not do these things again, he would not,\nthrough illegal means, try to change the 2020 election.\nIt is pretty clear the President of the United States did\nlearn a lesson: the lesson he can do whatever he wants, he can\nabuse his office, he will never, ever be held accountable by\nthis Senate. That was the lesson.\nHe has now, since acquittal, gone on a retribution tour,\nstarting at the prayer breakfast--a prayer breakfast, mind\nyou--continuing through the East Room, where many of you were\nin the audience and applauded him as he personally attacked\npeople who have served this country. He removed Colonel\nVindman, a patriot and Purple Heart recipient who spent his\nlife serving our country. He mocked his accent, his accent\nfrom--his Ukrainian accent.\nHe removed Ambassador Sondland, a Trump appointee, after he\ntestified to the quid pro quo.\nAnd yesterday--and the reason I bring this up today--he\ncontinued the tour, interfering at the Department of Justice,\nstrong-arming political appointees to overrule career\nprosecutors. Those attorneys withdrew in protest, those\nprofessionals. I have no idea of their political party. They\nare professionals. They withdrew in protest from the case and,\nin at least one case, resigned entirely from the Department.\nWe cannot give him a permanent license to turn the\nPresidency and the Executive branch into his own personal\nvengeance operation. You all know what is happening. Even the\nSenator that just walked out knows that it is happening. I am\nafraid that is what we are seeing, a personal vengeance\noperation. No one should be above the law.\nIf we say nothing--and I include everybody on this\nCommittee; I include myself. If we say nothing, it will get\nworse. His behavior will get worse. The retribution tour will\ncontinue. We all know that.\nMr. Chairman, now on to the issue at hand. I welcome\nChairman Powell back.\nEarlier this week, Bloomberg reported on a profitable and\nfast-growing Spanish company. Grifols has opened up branches in\n36 States. They buy and sell plasma--a nice, clinical-sounding\nword that means ``blood,'' as we know. Americans who are\nstruggling to make ends meet are lining up to sell their blood\nto put food on the table. The blood-harvesting business is\nbooming. Grifols stock is doing great.\nIt is hard to think of a better metaphor for the Trump\neconomy.\nOn Monday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both reached record\nhighs. In 2019, JPMorgan Chase had the best year for any U.S.\nbank in history, with $36 billion--36 thousand million\ndollars--in profits. Big corporations are spending hundreds of\nbillions of dollars on stock buybacks and dividends. On paper,\nthe economy has been expanding uninterrupted for over 10 years,\nalthough the growth the last 3 years of the Obama\nadministration has been greater than the growth of the first 3\nyears of the Trump administration. We know that, too.\nBut if you talk to the vast majority of people who rely on\npaychecks, not investment portfolios, to earn a living, you get\na very different story. They have been bleeding for years.\nMost families do not understand why the harder they work,\nsometimes at more than one job, the harder it gets to afford\npretty much everything--childcare, health care, rent, college\ntuition.\nThe people in this room may remember last September, when\nthe financial industry went into a panic over a benchmark\ninterest rate passing 10 percent.\nWall Street faced uncertainty, so we responded. The Fed\nleapt into action. Smart Government employees came up with a\nplan that led to the Federal Reserve lending about $200 billion\nevery day into financial markets through a mechanism that has\nnot been used since the financial crisis--$200 billion every\nday.\nLet me be clear: I do not think it is wrong for the Fed to\nbe creative and make sure the economy keeps working. It is in\neverybody's interest, Mr. Chairman, for banks to keep lending\nmoney and credit to keep flowing so businesses can invest and\nmanufacture, consumers can buy houses and cars.\nMy problem is this: When Main Street faces uncertainty, no\none at the Fed jumps to action or gets creative. The President\ndoes not criticize by tweet by name the Chairman of the Federal\nReserve when he says--he never demands corporations raise wages\nfor their workers. That is not ever his criticism of Chairman\nPowell.\nIt is hard for families to understand why Wall Street gets\nworked up about a 10-percent interest rate when so many\nfamilies are lucky if the payday lender down the street charges\nthem less than 400 percent.\nSmall businesses who are having trouble making payroll do\nnot have access to so-called repo funding at their local Fed\nbranch. The Fed does not take action when its own research has\nfound that 40 percent of Americans do not have the cash--think\nabout that. Probably not many people in this hearing room, but\n40 percent of Americans do not have $400 in cash when their car\nbreaks down to get to work to be able to fix. So they go to the\npayday lender, and then things spiral downward.\nNobody raises alarm bells when 40 million Americans predict\nthey will miss at least one credit card payment, which means\n$1.2 billion in late fees will flow from the pockets of\nstruggling families to help JPMorgan Chase earn $36 billion\nlast year.\n``Serious people'' have not dropped everything to bring\ndown the cost of housing or raise wages once they found out\nthat one in four are paying more than half their income toward\nhousing. One thing goes wrong in their life, their lives turn\nupside down.\nPeople look at that and they see two different economies\nand two different responses. We hear a lot about the divides in\nthis country between red and blue, between rural and urban, the\ncoasts and the heartland, the people who watch MSNBC and the\npeople who watch Fox. But people in all those places feel like\nno matter how hard they work, they cannot maintain any real\neconomic security. The real divide I see is between those whose\nproblems are considered an ``emergency'' and those whose\nstruggles Wall Street and large parts of Washington have\ndecided they can ignore.\nThe Fed needs to get creative for the people who make this\ncountry work, particularly because it has become pretty clear\nthat the President and the Majority Leader are simply not about\nto.\nPresident Trump brags about a soaring stock market that he\nhas pumped up with deficit-busting, trillion dollar tax breaks\nfor billionaires. Deficits exceeding $1 trillion, do not hear\nmuch about that anymore. And now he wants to pay for those tax\ncuts--sorry, we have got a big deficit, we have got to pay for\nthose tax cuts, as he said in Davos and he is saying in his\nbudget--by cutting Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security.\nHe lies about a ``blue-collar boom''--I heard it at the\nState of the Union that night; I was fairly incredulous--when\nin my own State of Ohio, job growth has been anemic or\nnonexistent, and manufacturing jobs are stalling compared to\nwhen he took office. And now in his budget, after promising\nworkers in Lordstown, Ohio, ``Do not sell your homes. We will\nbring those jobs back,'' he wants to kill the loan program that\nwas giving the community of Lordstown a little bit of hope that\nsome manufacturing jobs actually would come back.\nChairman Powell, you and your highly capable staff at the\nFed have been proactive and creative in protecting Wall Street\nand the money markets from the President's erratic behavior,\nand I am glad you have. We are all appreciative of that.\nBut what I hope to hear from you today is how you are going\nto be proactive and use that same level of creativity to make\nthis economy work for everyone else.\nThank you.\nChairman Crapo. Chairman Powell, I for one commend you for\nthe work that you are doing. I think that there are tremendous\nresults that I expect you will discuss with us today from the\nefforts that you have undertaken. You may now make your\nstatement, and then we will proceed.\nSTATEMENT OF JEROME H. POWELL, CHAIRMAN, BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF\nTHE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM\nMr. Powell. Thank you very much. Chairman Crapo, Ranking\nMember Brown, Members of the Committee, I am pleased to present\nthe Federal Reserve's semiannual Monetary Policy Report.\nMy colleagues and I strongly support the goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability that Congress has set for\nmonetary policy. Congress has given us an important degree of\nindependence to pursue these goals based solely on data and\nobjective analysis. This independence brings with it an\nobligation to explain clearly how we pursue our goals. Today I\nwill review the current economic situation before turning to\nmonetary policy.\nThe economic expansion is well into its 11th year, and it\nis the longest on record. Over the second half of last year,\neconomic activity increased at a moderate pace, and the labor\nmarket strengthened further, as the economy appeared resilient\nto the global headwinds that had intensified last summer.\nInflation has been low and stable but has continued to run\nbelow the FOMC's symmetric 2-percent objective.\nJob gains averaged 200,000 per month in the second half of\nlast year, and an additional 225,000 jobs were added in\nJanuary. The pace of job gains has remained above what is\nneeded to provide jobs for new workers entering the labor\nforce, allowing the unemployment rate to move down further over\nthe course of last year. The unemployment rate was 3.6 percent\nlast month and has been near half-century lows for more than a\nyear. Job openings remain plentiful. Employers are increasingly\nwilling to hire workers with fewer skills and train them. As a\nresult, the benefits of a strong labor market have become more\nwidely shared. People who live and work in low- and middle-\nincome communities are finding new opportunities. Employment\ngains have been broad based across all racial and ethnic groups\nand levels of education. Wages have been rising, particularly\nfor lower-paying jobs.\nGDP rose at a moderate rate over the second half of last\nyear. Growth in consumer spending moderated toward the end of\nthe year following earlier strong increases, but the\nfundamentals supporting household spending remain solid.\nResidential investment turned up in the second half, but\nbusiness investment and exports were weak, largely reflecting\nsluggish growth abroad and trade developments. Those same\nfactors weighed on activity at the Nation's factories, whose\noutput declined over the first half of 2019 and has been little\nchanged, on net, since then. The February Monetary Policy\nReport discusses the recent weakness in manufacturing. Some of\nthe uncertainties around trade have diminished recently, but\nrisks to the outlook remain. In particular, we are closely\nmonitoring the emergence of the coronavirus, which could lead\nto disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the\nglobal economy.\nInflation ran below the FOMC's symmetric 2-percent\nobjective throughout 2019. Over the 12 months through December,\noverall inflation based on the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures was 1.6 percent. Core inflation, which\nexcludes volatile food and energy prices, was also 1.6 percent.\nOver the next few months, we expect inflation to move closer to\n2 percent, as unusually low readings from early 2019 drop out\nof the 12-month calculation.\nThe Nation faces important longer-run challenges. Labor\nforce participation by individuals in their prime working years\nis at its highest rate in more than a decade. However, it\nremains lower than in most other advanced economies, and there\nare troubling labor market disparities across racial and ethnic\ngroups and across regions of the country. In addition, although\nit is encouraging that productivity growth, the main engine for\nraising wages and living standards over the longer term, has\nmoved up recently, productivity gains have been subpar\nthroughout this long economic expansion. Finding ways to boost\nlabor force participation and productivity growth would benefit\nAmericans and should remain a national priority.\nI will now turn to monetary policy. Over the second half of\n2019, the FOMC shifted to a more accommodative stance of\nmonetary policy to cushion the economy from weaker global\ngrowth and trade developments and to promote a faster return of\ninflation to our symmetric 2-percent objective. We lowered the\nFederal funds rate target range at our July, September, and\nOctober meetings, bringing the current target range to 1\\1/2\\\nto 1\\3/4\\ percent. At our subsequent meetings, with some\nuncertainties surrounding trade having diminished and amid some\nsigns that global growth may be stabilizing, the Committee left\nthe policy rate unchanged. The FOMC believes that the current\nstance of monetary policy will support continued economic\ngrowth, a strong labor market, and inflation returning to the\nCommittee's symmetric 2-percent objective. As long as incoming\ninformation about the economy remains broadly consistent with\nthis outlook, the current stance of monetary policy will likely\nremain appropriate. Of course, policy is not on a preset\ncourse. If developments emerge that cause a material\nreassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.\nTaking a longer view, there has been a decline over the\npast quarter-century in the level of interest rates consistent\nwith stable prices and an economy operating at its full\npotential. This low interest rate environment may limit the\nability of central banks to reduce policy interest rates enough\nto support the economy during a downturn. With this concern in\nmind, we have been conducting a review of our monetary policy\nstrategy, tools, and communications practices. Public\nengagement is at the heart of this effort. Through our Fed\nListens events, we have been hearing from representatives of\nconsumer, labor, business, community, and other groups. The\nFebruary Monetary Policy Report shares some of what we have\nlearned. The insights we have gained from these events have\ninformed our framework discussions, as reported in the minutes\nof our meetings. We will share our conclusions when we finish\nthe review, likely around the middle of this year.\nThe current low interest rate environment also means that\nit would be important for fiscal policy to help support the\neconomy if it weakens. Putting the Federal budget on a\nsustainable path when the economy is strong would help ensure\nthat policymakers have the space to use fiscal policy to assist\nin stabilizing the economy during a downturn. A more\nsustainable Federal budget could also support the economy's\ngrowth over the long term.\nFinally, I will just briefly review our planned technical\noperations to implement monetary policy, and the February\nMonetary Policy Report provides details of our operations to\ndate. Last October, the FOMC announced a plan to purchase\nTreasury bills and to conduct repo operations, and these\nactions have been successful in providing an ample supply of\nreserves to the banking system and effective control of the\nFederal funds rate. As our bill purchases continue to build\nreserves toward levels that maintain ample conditions, we\nintend to gradually transition away from the active use of repo\noperations. Also, as reserves reach durably ample levels, we\nintend to slow our purchases to a pace that will allow our\nbalance sheet to grow in line with trend demand for our\nliabilities. All of these technical measures support the\nefficient and effective implementation of monetary policy. They\nare not intended to represent a change in the stance of\nmonetary policy. As always, we stand ready to adjust the\ndetails of our technical operations as conditions warrant.\nThank you. I am happy to take your questions.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you, Chairman Powell. And as I said\nbefore, I will not use my 5 minutes for questions. In fact, I\nwill not use much of my 5 minutes at all, trying to set a\nstandard for the record of the Members of this Committee.\nBefore I turn the time to Senator Brown, however, and yield\nmy time, I wanted to indicate that it has been brought to my\nattention that Senator Shelby, who unfortunately is not able to\nbe here right now, recently became the longest-serving Member\nof the Senate Banking Committee in history.\nHe began his service on the Committee on January 6, 1987,\nand has now served approximately 33 years 1 month and 6 days.\nThat surpasses Senator Sparkman--interestingly, also of\nAlabama--who previously served on the Banking Committee between\nJanuary 6, 1947, and January 3, 1979, almost 32 years. Senator\nShelby has clearly seen dramatic changes in the financial\nservices industry over those years and himself has had a\nmeaningful impact on financial institutions, markets, and\nconsumers during his tenure on the Committee, including as\nChairman. I take this opportunity to thank him for his service\non this Committee and congratulate him on this significant\nmilestone.\nSenator Brown.\n[Applause.]\nSenator Brown. Is he here?\nChairman Crapo. He is not here. I yield my time to you.\nSenator Brown. We will clap again when he comes. Thank you,\nMr. Chairman. Thanks.\nWhen the Fed says it is nearing maximum employment and the\nlabor market is strong, it could mean workers have one good-\npaying job, or it could mean that a worker is working under 40\nhours at three part-time jobs at minimum wage. I think this\nhighlights how the economic recovery has not benefited nearly\neveryone. You hear these statistics, 40 percent, 50 percent\nof--I am sorry, 25 percent of people pay half their income in\nrent, 40 percent of Americans cannot come up with $400. So,\nclearly, it is not reaching everyone. If you have to work three\njobs or if you are working at a job in one of the ten fastest-\ngrowing professions--seven out of ten of those jobs are this--\nyou still cannot afford rent. Something is wrong.\nI appreciate you have been on a listening tour and I am\nlooking forward to your report, but I want to know, who do you\nhave at the Fed working on bold and creative ways to use the\nFed's authority--some tools we probably do not know about--\nusing your authorities to help working families that are not\nbenefiting from economic growth? What can you do to make sure\nthat most of our economic growth, not a sliver of it but most\nof our economic growth, ends up in workers' pockets?\nMr. Powell. Well, our tools are not focused on\ndistributional effects, really. They are focused on aggregate\neffects. We do not have those tools. Other agencies do, and, of\ncourse, elected officials hold really the power to address\nthose issues.\nBut I will say that, you know, the thrust of our review of\nmonetary policy, the first we have done of this nature, is to\nassure that we have the tools to carry out the mandate you have\ngiven us of maximum employment and stable prices in a world\nwhere inflation is trending lower, where the Phillips curve is\nvery flat, so that the connection between inflation and\ntightness in the economy is very, very low now, and also where\ninterest rates are quite low, which creates a very challenging\nenvironment for us to carry out the job you have given us, and\nthat is why we are doing a deep dive on issues around our\nstrategy, tools, and communications.\nSenator Brown. OK. I would ask you to--and these\nconversations can take place individually, too, but I would ask\nyou to be as creative as the Fed was. I just have a list here\nof extraordinary Federal actions that did not require Congress.\nI am not arguing Congress has done its job. Senator McConnell\nand the President have refused to raise the minimum wage. It\nhas been stuck for 11 years at under $8. They took away\novertime for about 2 or 3 million Americans because of\ntruncating the overtime rule, tax cuts for the rich, and now\ncuts for Medicare--we know Congress is not doing its job to\nredistribute income in any way that is fair to hundreds of\nmillions of Americans. We know that, but just this list\nquickly: the Maiden Lane direct purchase of assets, the Primary\nDealer Credit Facility, converting investment banks to bank\nholding companies so they could borrow from a discount window.\nThe Fed has been very creative to the country's benefit\nwhen Wall Street has reached difficult times, has run into\ndifficult times, sometimes of their own making, but the Fed\nis--I am a supporter of the Fed. Some people with my political\nphilosophy are not. And I think that you have stepped up in\nmany ways. I ask you to be as creative in thinking of ways that\nthis wealth is shared beyond the 1 or 2 or 5 or 10 percent who\nare doing very well, who are thrilled with the economy the way\nit is, and it just does not reach so many.\nOne other question, Mr. Chairman. I am worried about risks\nin our economy. I am glad the Fed is taking leveraged lending\nseriously, incorporating it into stress tests. At the same\ntime, we are seeing the financial system get more and more\nexotic. JPMorgan Chase through a supposedly unaffiliated fund\nwants to buy an electric plant in El Paso, also owns a stake in\na nuclear power plant. That means that JPMorgan Chase could\nlikely own a nuclear power plant. The Japanese equivalent of\nAmazon wants to form an industrial loan company in Utah so it\ncan get the benefits of being a bank without the regulation.\nAnd, recently, you voted with other bank regulators to weaken\nthe Volcker Rule by reversing protections in the 2013 rule\nallowing for more risky and leveraged investments.\nAre we going in the right direction? It seems the financial\nsystem again is getting more complex, more exotic, things\npeople do not understand. Shouldn't we be focusing on\nsimplifying it?\nMr. Powell. Well, what we are focused on is maintaining\nmuch higher capital, much higher liquidity requirements, stress\ntests, as you pointed out, that keep the banks on their toes\nand do address in a timely way the issues of the day, and also\nresolution planning. So those are the big four important\nmeasures broadly that we put into place after the financial\ncrisis, and we are focusing on sustaining those, making them\nmore effective, and keeping them strong.\nChairman Crapo. Senator Toomey.\nSenator Toomey. Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman.\nWelcome back, Mr. Chairman. Good to see you again. I have\nseveral somewhat technical questions I would like to go over\nwith you, and some of them we have discussed to varying degrees\nin the past. But one is the Fed's real-time payment system. As\nyou may recall, I was never convinced that this was a great\nidea for the Fed to pursue this since we have a private sector\nsystem in place up and running and really encouraged by the Fed\nback in the day. But I get the Board of Governors has made its\ndecision.\nHere is my question for you: A number of constituents have\nexpressed the concern that we are going to end up with two\nsystems that are not fully interoperable. And to the extent\nthat employers and financial institutions and other\nparticipants would be plugged into different systems, if they\nare not fully interoperable, there is a real concern that that\nis going to at a minimum diminish the ability to innovate in\nthese systems going forward.\nSo I guess I am wondering if you could--just briefly,\nbecause I do have several other topics--just address the\nquestion of whether it is a priority of the Fed to ensure that\nthe FedNow system will be fully interoperable with the\nclearinghouse system.\nMr. Powell. Full interoperability is the goal. It will be\nchallenging to reach it, but it is a high priority to assure\ninteroperability. It is something we are very focused on in the\ndesign stage.\nSenator Toomey. OK. And as I am sure you are aware, the\nclearinghouse system is committed to having flat fees and not\nproviding discounts for volume and the size of transactions,\nprovided that the FedNow system does not provide those kinds of\ndiscounts. Can the Fed commit that it will have uniform pricing\non this platform?\nMr. Powell. We have not made that commitment, and it is not\nclear that that is what our--that the banks who really wanted\nus to do this are looking for.\nSenator Toomey. Well, this is often cited as a reason why\nthe Fed needed to do this, is because the private system might\ndiscriminate on the basis of price. So I think it is important\nthat the clearinghouse system has volunteered--clearly, they\nare happy to be regulated if need be to ensure that this would\noccur. It would be really ironic and a shame if it turns out\nthat it is, in fact, the Fed that makes it more expensive for\nsmall banks to participate.\nLet me move on to SOFR. As we have discussed, you know, one\nof the challenges of replacing LIBOR is that LIBOR has an\nembedded credit risk element, it is an interbank rate; whereas,\nSOFR is a risk-free rate because it is essentially a repo rate.\nAnd that mismatch could conceivably create some problems,\nespecially to the extent that banks are funding themselves in\nan interbank market that is subject to spreads that SOFR may\nnot reflect. And so a mismatch in assets and liabilities could\nbecome problematic.\nSo my question is, I think yesterday you may have--and I\ndid not see the transcript, so correct me if I am wrong. But\nyou may have suggested that there is a thought of trying to\nintroduce a credit component, some kind of credit spread or\ncredit risk component to, as either a complement or an\nalternative or somehow integrate that with SOFR, and I am just\nwondering. Did I get that right? Is that something you guys are\nthinking about? Are you concerned about it at all?\nMr. Powell. I will just quickly say that LIBOR itself, we\ncannot assume that it will be published past the end of 2021.\nSo that has not changed, and everyone needs to take that on\nboard. SOFR is going to be the rate that a lot of the\nderivatives go to and many, many across the broad financial\nsystem will go to. But a number of banks have come forward and\nsaid that they want to work on a separate rate, which would not\nreplace SOFR but would be credit sensitive. And so they are\ndoing that now, and we are working with them to support that\nprocess. So, you know, we are open to that, but it does not\nmean that the transition away from LIBOR to SOFR will stop. It\nhas to go forward.\nSenator Toomey. OK. The last thing on my list here, the\nglitch in the repo market. As you and I discussed briefly, my\nconcern is when banks choose to earn less than 2 percent on\nexcess reserves when they could be earning up to 10 percent, at\nleast briefly, in the repo market. It suggests that there is\nsomething going on here, right? They could have put their money\ninto the repo market. They chose not to.\nI am not aware of an explicit rule that required that\nduring the episodes when these rates spiked, but, nevertheless,\nit happened. And so I wonder, and I am a little concerned that\nthere might be some kind of unspoken pressure on the part of\nregulators to favor cash on deposit with the Fed over liquidity\nin the form of repo transactions that goes beyond what is\nactually in the rules. And I am wondering, if you share that\nconcern, what you think about it. I know the Fed's response has\nbeen to provide liquidity, and that works in a given moment.\nBut if there is an underlying problem that has not been fixed,\nthen isn't there the risk that the spike in repo rates could\nrecur and you have to provide liquidity again. Could you\naddress that?\nMr. Powell. Sure. So there is not a preference for reserves\nover Treasurys in the LCR, but there is in the internal\nliquidity stress tests in the sense that, you know, it takes 1\nday to turn a Treasury into liquidity, just inherently there\nis. And I think the idea of putting Treasurys and reserves on\nan equal footing in terms of their treatment so that they can\nachieve liquidity is a good goal because we would--we do not\nwant to tilt banks in the direction of having to have more\nreserves than they really need. As long as the overall level of\nliquidity is at the appropriate level, we do not want to tilt\nthem in that direction. It may well be that we are doing that.\nYou may have seen Vice Chair Quarles give a speech on this, and\nhe talked about this issue at some length.\nSo we are looking at ways to address that, one of which is\njust to assume that the discount window is available in that\nstress test, which is a reasonable assumption to make. But I do\nthink there are things to do there, and the reason is, as you\nmentioned, there was liquidity but it did not flow, so it was\nnot liquid. And so the question is why not, and we are looking\nat ways to address that that will not undermine safety and\nsoundness but that will make the markets operate better.\nSenator Toomey. Thank you.\nChairman Crapo. Senator Reed.\nSenator Reed. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Let\nme thank you, Chairman Powell, for your leadership. Thank you\nfor joining us in Providence. It was a wonderful evening.\nI think it is important, too, your efforts to ensure the\nindependence of the Federal Reserve. Without an independent\nFederal Reserve, our national policymaking is, in my view,\nseverely flawed, so keep up your efforts, please.\nYou mentioned that we have had an expanding economy for 11\nyears. By my count, that would be 8 years under President\nObama, and 3 years under President Trump. The expansion is\ngood, but there are still some issues I think we should\naddress. The Pew Center put out a report in January, and they\nindicated that the share of wealth held by middle-income\nfamilies has been falling for roughly 20 years, and I would\nlike you to comment on whether it continues to fall despite\nthis expanding economy. And in addition to that, they point out\nthat income inequality in the U.S. has increased since 1980. If\nit is still increasing, please comment on that. And it is\ngreater than in peer countries, other countries that are\nsimilar to us in many other aspects.\nSo despite this expanding economy, if we are seeing a\nshrinkage of wealth in the middle class, and income inequality,\nthose are social, political, and economic trends that I do not\nthink are sustainable over time. They go to the fabric of the\ncountry. So are those trends continuing? And what policies can\nwe adopt, both fiscal and monetary to change them?\nMr. Powell. Those are longer-term trends that I think are\ndriven by important underlying factors, many of them global. So\nI think that--I would assume that the data will continue to\nmove in that direction. I think what they show is that incomes\nhave been moving up across the income spectrum, particularly if\nyou look at benefits and if you look at after-tax effect, it\ngets more even that way. But it has been a particularly good\ntime to be at the top end of the income spectrum. I would point\nto two key problems I think we ought to address. One is low\nmobility. We actually have lower mobility from, say, the bottom\nquintile to the middle quintile or the top quintile than many\nother advanced economies. This is not our self-image as a\ncountry, and it is something we need to address.\nThe other is just that the relative stagnation of those\nincomes in the middle and the low end, you know, we want, of\ncourse, prosperity to be broadly shared, and it comes down to\nreally education and training and things like that that enable\npeople to do well in the modern economy, which is a globalized\neconomy that is less about manufacturing--and the manufacturing\njobs are more technical than they were. So we need a workforce\nthat can benefit from technology and globalization, and those\nare policies that the Fed does not have our hands on.\nSenator Reed. No, you do not have those policies, but if we\njust sit back, those trends will continue and they will cause\neven further divergence between the vast majority of Americans\nand a very small group of Americans. So it is incumbent upon\nCongress and the Executive to start taking steps. Is that fair?\nMr. Powell. I think so. And I also think U.S. businesses\nget this very much now. If you talk to business leaders, they\nsee the workforce and the need for, you know, widely shared--we\nwant prosperity to be as widely shared as possible. You hear\nthat all the time from business leaders and certainly\nGovernment leaders as well. I do think it is an important\nnational priority.\nSenator Reed. Thank you.\nJust switching gears here, the Community Reinvestment Act\nis being massaged by both the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency and the FDIC, and there have been some comments\ncritical of their efforts, not just by, you know, affordable\nhousing advocates but by some banking institutions, that they\nare not doing a proper cost-benefit analysis and that their\nproposal unintentionally could discourage revitalization of\nneighborhoods that really do need it most.\nCan you let us know what role you might play and how you\ncan help get it right?\nMr. Powell. Sure. So, first of all, we are not going to\ncomment on their proposal. And it is out for a proposal. I\nthink all of us, including the FDIC and the OCC, are looking\nforward to seeing those comments and learning more.\nI think we do share the goal of modernizing CRA. Technology\nand demographics have really changed the delivery of banking\nservices, particularly in rural areas, for example, but\neverywhere. So it is time to do that. That has not been done in\n25 years. I think we agree on the goal, which is we want it to\nbe more effective, and it would help that if it were\ntransparent, more objective. So I think we share objectives\nwith those agencies, and we worked closely with them for a long\ntime to try to get completely on the same page. We developed\nour own approach, which was slightly different, a bit\ndifferent, and we were not able to get together in the end. But\nI think we should look at it as an ongoing process where we\nwill continue to learn, and that is going to be our approach.\nSenator Reed. Again, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I will\nstress independence one last time.\nChairman Crapo. Senator Sasse.\nSenator Sasse. Thank you, Chairman. Chairman Powell, thanks\nfor being here. We are grateful for your work.\nYou have been consistently raising warning bells about what\nyou have called ``the greatest threat'' to the financial\nsystem. You talk to many of us in private about cyberissues,\nand you said it yesterday over on the House side. I do not\nthink it is breaking through. Can you summarize for us why you\nare awake at night worried about cyberattacks on our financial\nsystem?\nMr. Powell. Sure. So they kind of pay us to be awake at\nnight worrying about things, and I would say that if you look\nat what happened in the financial crisis, we had a game plan\nthere; we implemented it over the course of 10 years. I will\nnot say that it is perfect or anything like that, but we have a\nplan that is meant to address those kinds of things.\nWhat is new in the threat environment is, you know, the\nongoing level of cyberthreat and the increasing sophistication\nof it, and so that is what we--we spend a ton of time worrying\nabout that, and, you know, the Treasury Department has really\nbeen taking the lead on that, and I think, you know, we have--\nso we are very focused on it. We are focused on making sure\nthat the financial institutions that we supervise are doing the\nbest that they can to stay at the state-of-the-art, good\ncyberhygiene. It turns out that a lot of these things are just\npeople failing to implement updating their software and things\nlike that. That is where a lot of breaches happen. So, I mean,\nit is an intense focus by supervisors and by financial\ninstitutions, also by nonfinancial institutions. Companies that\nare in, you know, all kinds of businesses are having this now.\nIt is an enormous focus. We will never say that we have--it\nnever feels like we have done enough, but it is just something\nwe keep trying to get better and better at, lots of resources\non it in all the agencies and all the companies.\nSenator Sasse. And if you would concretize for us, give us\nmaybe two examples of a way that you think this attack could\nhave, you know, spillover efforts. How do the dominoes work\nwithout giving somebody a template or road map? You have talked\nin private a few times about ways that this could cause bigger\nconsequences than 2008 and 2009. How would that happen?\nMr. Powell. Without wanting to get too much into it, I\nwould just say that confidence in the financial system is\nreally important. The public has to have confidence in the\nfinancial system. And so a successful cyberattack on a payments\nutility, for example, would be challenging. We could address\nthat. We could isolate it. We could fix it. But you would want\nto avoid somehow broader blows to confidence. Because when\nconfidence weakens, people will take their money out. They will\nstop acting and things like that. Uncertainty and lack of\nconfidence are the enemy of economic activity and growth.\nSenator Sasse. I think we need to also recognize that the\nmany different conversations we have with the Chinese\nGovernment tend to have a benign diplomatic flavor. I think we\nshould underscore what has happened this week, with the Equifax\nhack having new headlines, so the 2017 hack of Equifax which\ncompromised the personal financial records of more than 30\npercent, 35 percent of all Americans. The Justice Department\nearlier this week indicted four Chinese Communist Party\nofficials affiliated with military intelligence in China. This\nis not an accident. This is the same Communist Party that\nhacked the OPM records and now has moved on to Equifax.\nCan you envision scenarios where the Chinese Community\nParty was hacking into the U.S. banking system?\nMr. Powell. Well, we need to be resilient against all\ncyberthreats, and certainly, you know, State actors are a big\npart of that. And so we are well aware of those. By the way, we\nhave help from the intelligence agencies and others in the\nGovernment in keeping our eyes out for that.\nSenator Sasse. Shifting gears a little bit, the President's\nbudget came out this last weekend, and some of us are going to\nbe in the Finance Committee later today discussing the larger\nbudget. We tend to have headlines that focus on whatever the\ndiscretionary programs are that tend to be more hot button and\ncurrent in the news. But you have talked consistently about\nhealth entitlements and its challenge to the--or maybe more\nbroadly than health entitlements, the inefficiencies of our\nhealth care delivery system. For a developed Nation, we have\nvery mediocre health outcomes, and we have ridiculously high\nprice tags.\nCan you talk a little bit about the consequences of U.S.\nhealth on competitiveness, on our larger economy?\nMr. Powell. I would be happy to. Of course, I should start\nby saying that it is not really--we do not do fiscal policy,\nand we do not give you advice on fiscal policy. But since you\nask, really, the budget--the biggest issue of our Federal\nbudget is just its health care spending. And it is not that our\nbenefits are too generous. It is that we deliver them in a way\nthat is measured by the outcomes. The outcomes are perfectly\naverage for a First World Nation, but we spend 6 or 7 percent\nof GDP more than other countries do. And so it is about the\ndelivery, and that is a lot of money every year that you are\neffectively spending and getting nothing. And I have to leave\nit with you there. It is not for us or for me to prescribe, you\nknow, fixes. But I think that really is what it is about. Those\ndiscretionary things, of course, are very high profile and they\nget a lot of reporting, but ultimately that is what is driving\nit.\nAgain, I would stress it is not that these benefits are\nfabulously generous. They are just what people get in Western\neconomies. But we deliver them at the cost of, you know, 17, 18\npercent of GDP, and others do it at 11 percent of GDP. That is\nwhat we should be focusing on.\nSenator Sasse. Thank you, Chairman.\nChairman Crapo. Senator Tester.\nSenator Tester. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking\nMember Brown, for having this hearing. And I want to thank you,\nChairman Powell, for your work. I did not hear all of Senator\nReed's questions, but if it has to do with independence of the\nFed, count me on that bloc, too. I think it is critically\nimportant you maintain that independence and hang to it, and I\napplaud you on your efforts thus far.\nBoth the Fed, through lower rates, and Congress, through\nincreased spending, through increased debt, have been taking\nactions to boost the economy during a long stretch of growth. I\nam concerned that if we do approach a downturn--and there are a\nnumber of indicators out there that are concerning to me--that\nour options to address a downturn are limited. I want to hear\nyour perspective on what the Fed has, its ability to react to\nan economic downturn, the tools.\nMr. Powell. Thank you. So our traditional tool, of course,\nis interest rates, and low rates are not really a choice\nanymore. They are a fact of reality, and they are likely to\nremain. So we will have less room to cut. That means it is much\nmore likely that we will have to turn to the tools that we used\nin the financial crisis when we hit the lower bound.\nSenator Tester. Which is?\nMr. Powell. Which is forward guidance, which says that we\nwill keep rates low, and then it is also large-scale asset\npurchases of longer-term securities to drive longer-term rates\ndown and support the economy. We will use those tools. I\nbelieve we will use them aggressively should the need arise to\ndo so. There is no need to do that now. But we will use those\ntools aggressively.\nThe sense of the review that we are undertaking of our\nstrategy, tools, and communications right now and which we\nthink we will announce our conclusions on in midyear is that we\nare looking to make sure that in this low rate environment,\ndifficult environment for central banks and for those who we\nwork for, that we are using our tools as best we can, that we\nhave explored every possible way to find, you know, every scrap\nof policy space, if you will, to be able to support the\neconomy.\nAnd then, finally, I would just stress that it is important\nthat fiscal policy be in a position, as it always has been, to\nsupport the economy in a downturn as well.\nSenator Tester. So let me ask you this: The debt is at $23\ntrillion right now? Is that about right? Something like that.\nMr. Powell. Yes.\nSenator Tester. At what point in time do you get concerned?\nI mean, I think the budget the President just put out adds\nanother $1 trillion to the debt.\nMr. Powell. It is very hard to say at what level you get\nconcerned. I would say I would be concerned now. It is really\nthe rate of increase. What we need to do is have the debt grow\nslower than the economy is growing. If the economy is growing\nfaster than the debt, then effectively leverage is going down,\nso debt to GDP will not be--what is happening is debt to GDP is\ngoing up and going up fairly quickly as these things move.\nOther countries have managed to get to very high levels, much\nmore than ours, but what it means is that 20 years from now we\nwill be spending those tax dollars, our children will be\nspending those tax dollars on servicing the debt rather than on\nthe things that they really need. We are sending them those\nbills.\nSenator Tester. And the debt does not go down if the\neconomy downturns?\nMr. Powell. No, no, not at all. Quite the opposite.\nSenator Tester. Exactly right. It becomes much bigger of an\nissue.\nMr. Powell. Yeah.\nSenator Tester. I want to talk about housing because it is\na big issue I think everywhere, rural America and urban\nAmerica. From your position, what do you see the housing\nchallenge and impact on individuals and the economy?\nMr. Powell. Housing is generally facing difficulties in\naffordability. The housing industry is doing better and\nbuilding more houses and is profitable and housing starts are\ngoing up. But I think from the standpoint of the public, you\nhave a squeeze going on which has to do with difficulty in\ngetting lots; you know, there are just supply side constraints\nwhich are keeping the quantity of housing down, lack of skilled\nlabor, regulations of various kinds. And so what you see many,\nmany places, not just in big cities, you see housing\naffordability challenges, and it is a fairly wide-scale\nproblem.\nSenator Tester. And I just want to ask this really quickly,\nbecause there has been a lot of debate for a number of years,\nmuch of it started by the Senator to my left, on GSE reform.\nDoes GSE reform or lack of GSE reform have any impacts on the\nhousing situation?\nMr. Powell. I think in the long run it is very important\nthat GSE reform happen, that we move forward with that. I think\nthat is a big unfinished piece of business from the financial\ncrisis. It is not really ideal to have the entire housing\nfinance system riding on the Federal Government. In the long\nrun, it would be better to move forward with something, I\nthink. And I think in the long run that is a more sustainable\nbasis for housing finance.\nSenator Tester. Thank you for your work. I have some other\nquestions on agriculture. I will put them in the record.\nThank you very much for your service.\nMr. Powell. Thank you.\nSenator Brown [presiding]. Senator Rounds.\nSenator Rounds. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nMr. Chairman, first of all, welcome. And I just want to\necho what some of my colleagues have said about the\nindependence of the Fed, and I think on both sides of the aisle\nyou will find strong support for an independent Fed.\nI would like to begin by asking you about a rule that I\nrecently filed a comment letter on, and that is the Fed's\nbuilding blocks approach. As I mentioned in my letter, it does\nnot seem to make sense for the Fed to resurrect the original\nSection 171 calculation from Dodd-Frank. I understand that this\nparticular calculation unintentionally imposed bank-centric\ncapital rules on insurance savings and loan holding companies,\nwhich have a totally different business model.\nCongress spoke very clearly through the passage of the\nInsurance Capital Standards Clarification Act that its intent\nwas for banks to be regulated like banks and for insurance\ncompanies to be regulated like insurance companies. Given the\nclear intent of Congress, why has the Fed chosen to revisit\nSection 171? How does the Fed intend to move forward?\nMr. Powell. Thank you for your comment. We got a number of\ncomments on that issue, and we are looking at it. And, of\ncourse, we have looked at the law change, and the question we\nare asking is whether there is--you know, what is the nature of\nthe change made in the law and does it apply here? So we will\nbe reviewing those comments and, you know, considering them in\ngetting to a view on that.\nSenator Rounds. As you know, one of the reasons for having\nthese open discussions is to bring attention to it, and, in\nfact, I think it is a very serious issue, and I think it does\nneed the full attention of the Fed, and hopefully you will get\nit resolved as quickly as possible to avoid any questions that\nmay be lingering out there.\nMr. Powell. Will do.\nSenator Rounds. I would also like to talk a little bit\nabout--Vice Chair Quarles recently remarked that business fixed\ninvestment continues to be weak, having declined over the\ncourse of 2019. Do you think it is fair to say that a large\npart of this is driven by uncertainty with regards to trade and\nthat businesses are waiting to see how trade tensions are\nresolved before they are prepared to make further investments?\nMr. Powell. You know, I would say there are a bunch of\nfactors that we need to look at. One is just the global growth\nslowdown, particularly in manufacturing. Another is lower oil\nprices. In the United States, a big swing factor in business\nfixed investment is drilling. Our work and that of many outside\neconomists does suggest that there is also a role for trade\npolicy, and uncertainty around trade policy. So, I mean, the\nshort answer to your question would be yes, I do think there is\nupside there, to the extent businesses see uncertainty around\nthe trade situation as having declined.\nSenator Rounds. OK. Recently, I understand that there has\nbeen a discussion about groupthink and about how the Fed\napproaches it within the meetings. Do you think it is important\nfor the Fed Board to reject groupthink and consider a variety\nof different viewpoints?\nMr. Powell. I do. In fact, I very much do. I am strongly\ninclined to think that you need to hear all sides of a case. In\nfact, when I was a private equity investor, I used to speak\nagainst my own deals just to force people to defend them, so I\nwould, you know, really get a sense that I believe in things.\nSo it is critical to have diverse perspectives. I really think\nwe do, though, particularly through the--if you think about it,\nthe Reserve Bank System guarantees from an institutional\nstandpoint that we will always have diverse perspectives on\nmonetary policy.\nOn regulation, you know, where we get it is from the\ncomments and from the disparate group of people who are on the\nBoard. If you look at who is on the Board, a number of us have\nprimarily private sector backgrounds, and we bring that to the\ntable.\nSenator Rounds. Pretty fair to say that you can have people\nfrom varying points of view that can have very lively\ndiscussions, and yet at the end of the day still be a part of a\nvery strong team.\nMr. Powell. Absolutely. I really think it just makes you\nstronger. I do. I feel that way. And, of course, we have had\nplenty of dissent at the Fed over the years.\nSenator Rounds. Thank you. One last question. When the\nBoard voted on its rule for tailoring resolutions plans last\nfall, Vice Chair Quarles gave a statement essentially saying\nthat there is more that could be done when it comes to\ntailoring from a supervisory standpoint. Can you elaborate on\nhow the Fed intends to move forward with this?\nMr. Powell. So Vice Chair Quarles, as I am sure you know,\ngave a speech on that and laid out really quite a number of\naspects of that. You know, so we are going to be--these were\nideas. They are not quite at the stage of being proposals yet,\nbut we are going to be looking at those.\nSenator Rounds. How will they be manifest? Are they going\nto come out as a rulemaking? Or are they going to come out as\nguidance?\nMr. Powell. Some of it will be rulemaking; some of it will\nbe guidance; some of it will be changes to guidance. If you\nlook, there are many, many different ideas. I think the key\nthing is he highlights the tension between, you know, the right\nto due process and clarity that we depend upon from our\nGovernment. Right? But also with supervision, there is also a\nrole for discretion and for confidentiality. So I think it is a\nvery thoughtful process of looking at that and asking how can\nwe make it more transparent with more due process, but still\neffective because supervision has to be firm but fair.\nSenator Rounds. Thank you.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Crapo [presiding]. Thank you.\nSenator Warner.\nSenator Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Powell,\ngreat to see you again. Thank you for your good work.\nI want to make a couple quick comments, echoing what\nSenator Rounds and Senator Reed and others have said. I think\nthere are a lot of our institutions' independence under assault\nthese days. I share some of the concerns of Senator Brown about\nthe independence of the Justice Department. I fight on a\nregular basis to try to make sure the intelligence community\ncan maintain their independence.\nI would ask and frankly plead with you that, if you see\nefforts made to undermine the Fed's independence, you keep this\nCommittee fully abreast. I think the Fed's independence is more\nimportant than ever at this point.\nI am going to also follow up on my good friend Senator\nSasse's comments about Equifax. I share with you the belief the\nchallenge that China poses. But I also think, particularly in\nthe case of Equifax and the credit rating agencies broadly,\nnone of us choose to be an Equifax customer, or any credit\nrating agency. That break-in, that cyberattack was due to\nsloppy behavior by Equifax, and the fact that we have not put\nin place, frankly, any enhanced rules of liability around these\ncredit reporting agencies is something I hope--I know I have\ntalked with the Chairman at times--that we would come back to,\nbecause I think while we have to be on guard, if we do not have\nat least de minimis standards and they can bake this kind of\nobscene break into the cost of business, I do not think that is\ngood for anyone. And, again, I hope we are able to come back to\nthat.\nI do have a bunch of questions for you as well, Chairman\nPowell. Yesterday in your testimony, you talked about this\nmovement toward digital currency, something I am very\ninterested in, and you indicated, you know, it is possible that\nthere might be a United States-backed digital currency. We have\nthe possibility of doing that. My question is: Would that be\ndesirable? I get the component parts around it. A digital\ncurrency might provide convenience and potentially even lower\nfriction costs in terms of credit to consumers. But how do we\nweigh in privacy and cyberconcerns? How would that deal with\nour retail banking system? And do you think the Fed has the\ncapacity to do this without congressional approval? Go at it a\nlittle bit more, and then I have got one last question about\nChina's role in this space. But talk to me first about the\ndomestic implications.\nMr. Powell. Sure. So you have listened the potential costs\nand benefits. The benefits would include, you know, perhaps\ngreater financial inclusion, lower costs, more convenience, and\nall those things. Their risks or costs would include cyberrisk\nand fraud risk and privacy risk and things like that. So I\nthink there is a lot to weigh and a lot to work on there.\nEvery major central bank in the world right now is doing a\ndeep dive on digital currencies, and we think it is our\nresponsibility to be at the very forefront of knowledge and\nthinking about a central bank digital currency.\nSenator Warner. Would you take a positive action on that\nwithout congressional input? Do you feel like you have that\nauthority?\nMr. Powell. So it would depend a lot on the design choices.\nIt is a good question, one that we are working on. I would say\nwe are working very broadly, including working with other\ncentral banks around the world, on this. There is just a lot of\nthinking and experimentation and understanding that we are\ngaining. And if there is a need for--if we conclude that we\nneed more authority and that this is something appropriate to\ndo, then we will ask for the authority.\nSenator Warner. One of the things you mentioned yesterday--\nand I and Senator Sasse and a number of us who are on the\nIntelligence Committee are concerned about the rise of China in\na series of areas. And I think it is clear that China may move\nquicker than us on a digital currency. You said you have got\nsome visibility into what China might be doing on digital\ncurrency. I would love you to spell that out a little bit. Do\nyou think they will use their influence through kind of Belt\nand Road investment strategy and the number of countries that\nhave kind of bought into that system, that they might be then,\nyou know, also buying into that Chinese digital currency? What\nwould that do in terms of cross-border? What would that do in\nterms of dollar supremacy? You know, any further guidance you\nmight have on your insight into China's actions in this space\nwould be helpful.\nMr. Powell. I would just say we have to assume that--what\nwould that mean? We have to ask the question: What would it\nmean if China had a digital currency that had fairly wide\nadoption, including to other countries? We have got to ask\nthat. I think we have also got to ask what if a private sector\nentity, you know, a large company with a large network of\nusers, has a digital currency? So we are looking----\nSenator Warner. That has already popped out, and I think we\nhave pretty bipartisan concerns on that one.\nMr. Powell. That is why we are doing all this work. We\nunderstand. I would say Libra was something that lit a bit of a\nfire. This is something--we have been focusing on digital\ncurrencies for, you know, a couple decades, but it has really\nlit a fire around the world right now, so we are doing a great\ndeal of work.\nSenator Warner. My time is up. I just want to say I would\nurge, having seen China's ability to move aggressively in a\nseries of other areas, that you start forging that coalition of\nthe willing amongst other central banks sooner rather than\nlater.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Crapo. Senator Perdue.\nSenator Perdue. Thank you, Chair.\nMr. Chairman, thank you for being here again. It is good to\nsee you. I just have one quick question in light of the time.\nYou know, we have two dynamics right now that are driving the\neconomy in different directions potentially. Labor is now a\nlimiting factor in terms of we have got roughly 7 million job\nopenings and about 5 million people looking for work. So it a\nphenomenon right now that is a limiting factor.\nOn the other hand, we have low energy costs. Since 2007, we\nhave doubled our output of oil such that now we are a net\nexporter of oil and gas, the largest producer in the world.\nEight percent of our economy is energy; 15 percent of our CapEx\nis going to that today. We produce 50 percent more barrels of\noil a day than Saudi Arabia and about 18 percent of the world's\noutput. My question is: Are we in a low energy price\nenvironment? And what assumptions are you making then over the\nnext decade? And what impact do you think that will have on\ninflation, deflation? I know you have talked about deflationary\nconcerns in the past. Where are we today on that big factor in\nour economy--energy?\nMr. Powell. So it has been transformational. If you think\nback when we were in college, if energy spiked, inflation went\nup, people got out of work, there were long lines at the gas\npump. We now have a very large domestic energy industry which\namounts to a shock absorber. When that happens, U.S. drilling\ngoes up with the price of oil. It puts people back to work. It\ncontrols prices. It controls inflation.\nSo we are in a situation where that particular mechanic for\ninflation going up is just not happening anymore because the\nsupply response from the U.S. industry is quick and large, so\nyou will not see that having sustained effects on inflation,\nand also you will not see it having sustained negative effects\non growth, because it kind of offsets, roughly offsets the\neffect of lower energy prices at the pump. That will slow the\neconomy down a bit. But the new supply that comes on will put\npeople to work. It will be different people, but overall, it is\na very different and better place to be.\nSenator Perdue. Are you concerned about the workforce\nparticipation rate? With the growth of jobs over the last 3\nyears, workforce participation recently has bumped up a little\nbit, but it really has not moved as much as one might have\nthought.\nMr. Powell. It is greatly a surprise to the upside, which\nis a great thing. But, remember, the prediction--basically,\nlabor force, just because of demographics, participation should\ndrop by about a quarter-of-a-percent a year. It has now been\nflat since 2013. We think there is more upside. So what is\nhappening is labor is tight everywhere, but, actually, there is\na supply response from the public, which is a very positive\nthing. We never thought we would see 63.4 percent labor force\nparticipation again. Nobody had that in their model 7 years\nago. But that is what we have, and it is really a very positive\nthing.\nSenator Perdue. Good. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nIn light of time, Mr. Chair, thank you very much. I yield\nback.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you.\nSenator Schatz.\nSenator Schatz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you,\nChairman Powell, for being here.\nFirst question: How does income inequality impact economic\ngrowth? There is a lot of talk on the policymaking side of the\nimpact on families. How does it hit your analysis? And what can\nbe done on your side of the shop?\nMr. Powell. Well, obviously people who are at the bottom\nend of the income spectrum whose incomes are not growing, their\nconsumption will be constrained. You know, their consumption\nwill be constrained, and their marginal propensity to consume\nout of new dollars will be high. To the extent gains are going\nto the people at the top, their marginal propensity to consume\nout of wealth will be low, so that it will not be hitting GDP;\nit will be going into savings. But those are effects that will\nshow up quite gradually over time. Inequality is a gradually\nmoving phenomenon.\nSenator Schatz. Talk to me about the relationship between\nproductivity and unemployment. Is there a new relationship that\nis emerging? Is there any new thinking along those lines?\nBecause I think the traditional analysis is as productivity\ngoes up, that is basically good for the economy; but it seems\nto me that at least the way people perceive it is that those\ntwo things are decoupled, that productivity goes up, that does\nnot mean wages go up. And I am wondering whether that is a\nchange or if that is sort of more of a political overlay to\nsay, hey, look, things may look good but we are still on the\nbottom eating your scraps. I am wondering whether it is more\nthan that and that there is actually a change in the way you\nanalyze this.\nMr. Powell. Well, I think we are always learning. We are\nalways learning, and we have seen relatively low productivity\nin the wake of the financial crisis. And it appears to be\npersistent, and that is going to mean lower wages.\nUltimately, you need rising productivity to create rising\nstandards of living. It just has to be that way. It does not\nmean in any given year you will see that. But you do see a\npretty tight connection between--if you add in benefits, not\njust wages, but look at the full cost of employment, you see--I\nwill not call it ``tight,'' but you see a connection between\nrising productivity and rising wages.\nSenator Schatz. I guess the question is they are no less\ncorrelated than they used to be?\nMr. Powell. I would not say that, no. I would say, if you\nlook at the moment, if you think of wages as being right around\n3 percent, productivity growth has been low, has just recently\nmoved up. It recently moved up close to 2 percent. And\ninflation is 2 percent.\nSenator Schatz. The other thing I would add is that if you\nare doing total compensation, if most of the increase in total\ncomp is just that the employer absorbed a 7-percent increase in\nhealth care costs, you know, that is not really an increase in\nwages in the traditional sense. I get that from the employer's\nstandpoint it sure feels like an increase in wages. But if you\nare trying to maximize compensation, it means nothing to a\nregular person who says, ``OK, I have got no more money, but it\ncost my employer more, so I should be happy about that.''\nLet me just move on to climate. I have a couple of\nquestions. What is the Fed doing in regard to climate-related\nfinancial disclosures? I know you are making some progress. I\nwould like you to talk about that.\nMr. Powell. I think, like others, other central banks, we\nare at the beginning of the process of understanding how\nclimate change affects our work. I think one way we know that\nit will affect our work is that the public will count on us to\nmake sure that financial institutions that we regulate--central\ncounterparties, banks, things like that--will be robust to the\nrisks that come from climate change. And we are at, as I said,\nthe beginning of understanding exactly what all that means.\nIn terms of disclosure, you know, it is more really an FDIC\nissue. They are the ones who regulate appropriate disclosure,\nand I think they have been doing some work on this lately.\nSenator Schatz. You had an exchange with a Member of the\nHouse, I think it was yesterday, and the question was whether\nwe ought to be stress-testing for climate risks, and you said\nyou are watching the Bank of England. I am wondering if you can\nelaborate on that.\nMr. Powell. So they are doing stress tests which are not at\nall connected to CCAR, what would be the CCAR process, which is\nthe one that relates to the amount of dividends, distributions\nthat a company can have. This is more just exploratory. They\nare exploratory scenarios, and we are very closely monitoring\nthat. You know, we have good relationships with all the major\ncentral banks, especially the Bank of England and others. So we\nwill be looking at that, and it is something we will be\nthinking about. We have not made any decisions, but as I said,\nthese are early days. We are actually doing, you know, a fair\namount of work all through the Federal Reserve System on\nunderstanding this emerging risk.\nSenator Schatz. Thank you.\nSenator Kennedy. Mr. Chairman, thanks for being here. I\nthink you are doing a great job.\nSenator Brown [presiding]. Senator Kennedy.\nMr. Powell. Thank you.\nSenator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nOur labor force participation rate is much better, but\ncompared to other OECD countries, we lag. Why?\nMr. Powell. That is a great question. So it is a\ncombination of things, no doubt. It is that educational\nattainment in the United States, which was once the highest,\nhas really fallen relative to our peers, and particularly among\nlower- and middle-income people, the level of educational\nattainment has really plateaued.\nSenator Kennedy. Right.\nMr. Powell. And that is the key thing for keeping in the\nlabor market----\nSenator Kennedy. What else?\nMr. Powell. That is one. I would say the opioid crisis is\nnot helping. I would say, you know, if you think about it, both\nglobalization and technology probably advantage people of\nrelatively high education and do not advantage people, for\nexample, in manufacturing. So if you think about what has\nhappened to the manufacturing base in many, many countries, a\nlot of those jobs have either been automated or moved abroad.\nThe manufacturing that we have now is very efficient and does\nnot use as many people.\nSenator Kennedy. What else? Has trade played an impact?\nMr. Powell. Sorry?\nSenator Kennedy. Trade tariffs.\nMr. Powell. Well, I would say trade tariffs--well, through\nthis period, we really have had declining tariffs since World\nWar II until lately here.\nSenator Kennedy. Right.\nMr. Powell. And we have had increasing labor force\nparticipation here because of the underlying strength----\nSenator Kennedy. Does the richness of our social programs\nplay a part?\nMr. Powell. It is very hard to make that connection, and I\nwill tell you why. If you look in real terms, adjusted for\ninflation, at the benefits that people get, they have actually\ndeclined. During this period of declining labor force\nparticipation, they have not gone up in real terms. So it is\nnot better or more comfortable to be poor and on public\nbenefits now. It is actually worse than it was.\nSenator Kennedy. All right. It seems to me--and there is\ngoing to be a question in here, I promise. I know sometimes you\nnever get one.\nMr. Powell. That is OK.\nSenator Kennedy. It seems to me that any fair-minded person\nwould have to conclude that our economy is better. I am biased,\nof course, but I think the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act worked. And we\nhave seen wage increases, including, but not limited to, the\nbottom quartile. And we have seen unemployment go down. But we\nstill have a problem in America, and a lot of anger, and I\nthink the root--this is one person's opinion, but the root of a\nlot of that anger is that we still have too many people in this\ncountry who are not participating in the great wealth of this\ncountry, not economically, not socially, not culturally.\nI think Sanders supporters and Trump supporters have more\nin common than they realize. The American Dream has become the\nAmerican Game to them, and they think it is fixed. Now, the\nmanagerial elite is doing fine, but I am talking about ordinary\npeople.\nWhat, if any, role do you think the Fed should play in\nhelping us address that?\nMr. Powell. First of all, I think there is a lot in what\nyou said. The single most important thing we can do is take\nseriously your order to us to achieve maximum employment.\n``Maximum employment,'' that is what the law says. And that is\nwhat we are doing. We are using our tools to keep an eye on\nmaximum employment, and I think there is no reason why the\ncurrent situation of low unemployment, rising wages, high job\ncreation, there is no reason why that cannot go on. There\nreally is not. There is nothing about this economy that is out\nof kilter or imbalanced. That is the main thing that we can do.\nWe do other things that are in the nature of convening. You\nknow, we do a lot of research in your State and others. The\nFederal Reserve Bank will have an operation where they are\ntrying to convene resources around issues of education and\npoverty and things like that in poor communities. We do not\nhave the ability to spend money on it. We get community people\naround a table and try to organize things that help the\ncommunity, as I am sure you know.\nSo it is not really something we can do a lot about other\nthan research and do our jobs on monetary policy.\nSenator Brown. Thank you, Senator Kennedy.\nSenator Cortez Masto.\nSenator Kennedy. If I could have another 10 seconds, Mr.\nChairman? I was distracted because you were talking.\nStay independent. I think you are doing a great job, and\nall of us in politics are going to give you plenty of advice.\nBut call them like you see them.\nThank you.\nSenator Brown. Senator Cortez Masto.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you, Chairman Powell. It is\ngreat to see you again. Thank you so much for being here and\nalways being responsive.\nLet me follow up on this line of discussion of maximum\nemployment, and I so appreciate the conversation. You keep\ntalking about a level of educational attainment that is so\nimportant. What do you define as that education? When you talk\nabout that, what does that mean?\nMr. Powell. Anything that gives you skills that would work\nin the workplace. That could include internships; that could\ninclude the kind of training that people are getting now who go\nright out of high school into a program. It is not meant to be\nlimited to, you know, college as such or, you know, getting a\nliberal arts degree. It is really the acquisition of skills in\nsociety.\nSenator Cortez Masto. So do you think we have changed in\nsociety, that it is very difficult now to just graduate from\nhigh school and get a job that pays a decent wage for your\nfamily without getting some sort of additional education?\nMr. Powell. Yes, it is. I think you see that very much. For\npeople with high school degrees, their incomes have stagnated\nbadly for a long time. What happens with technological change\nis that it wants higher and higher levels of skill, and if\nsociety provides those people and those skills, then incomes\ncan go up across the board and inequality can go down. That was\nthe American story for a long, long time.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Sure, but isn't part of that--and\nthis is why I am curious your thoughts on this. Part of that\nalso has to do with the wages and the increase in wages and the\nlevel of wage that you are paying. Are you saying just because\nyou graduate from high school and you want that job, whatever\nthat job is that you are able to do, it should be a minimum\nlevel of wage and should never increase, even with the gains in\nproductivity that we have seen over the years?\nMr. Powell. No, I am not saying that at all.\nSenator Cortez Masto. OK, good, because I agree with you.\nBecause I think there are also people in this country--and I so\nam pleased with the high unemployment rate, but I also think--\nand they live in my State--that are working two jobs. They are\nactually working two jobs because the wages are so low. And I\nthink there is a disparity that we have to do a better job of\nunderstanding.\nI was looking through the Monetary Report that you gave,\nand I am curious. Do you identify--because I did not see it\nhere, but do you identify those individuals who are actually\nworking two jobs?\nMr. Powell. Those are identified in the data collected by\nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics, yes, and----\nSenator Cortez Masto. And that is what you utilize here?\nAnd is that data that you can provide that gives us a better\nunderstanding----\nMr. Powell. Sure.\nSenator Cortez Masto. ----of how many Americans across this\ncountry are actually working two jobs just to make ends meet?\nMr. Powell. Very high level right now.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Yeah, and that is what I would like\nto see. I think that would be helpful----\nMr. Powell. We can share that with you.\nSenator Cortez Masto. ----for us as we work with you moving\nforward.\nJust one final question because I know the votes have been\ncalled. You note in your opening remarks that there are\ntroubling labor market disparities across racial and ethnic\ngroups and across regions of the country. Can you go into more\nspecifics with that statement?\nMr. Powell. Sure, and we actually had a box in our Monetary\nPolicy Report I think a year ago about rural and urban\ndisparities, which are just getting wider and wider and wider,\nand it talked about, you know, what might be causing that. You\nreally have a long-term trend here that is challenging for\npeople in rural areas.\nIn terms of racial and ethnic disparities, the African\nAmerican unemployment rate is roughly twice that of the overall\nunemployment rate, and, you know, you see different groups. So\nit is troubling that these things would persist in this way. We\ndo not have the ability to operate directly on that other than,\nagain, by carrying out our mandate of maximum employment and\nstable prices.\nSenator Cortez Masto. But as you study it, what are you\nfinding? Why is there that disparity? What can you point to?\nMr. Powell. Which disparity?\nSenator Cortez Masto. The racial disparity that you just\ntalked about.\nMr. Powell. You know, I think it is tied into history, to\nour history, and there are higher levels of poverty in the\nAfrican American community, as you know, and that is because of\nour history. But we would like to see those gaps declining more\nthan they are.\nSenator Cortez Masto. OK.\nMr. Powell. Those are not tools that we have. Tools that\nyou have to do that.\nSenator Cortez Masto. But there is nothing--and what I am\nlooking for is the data. There is no data or no data points\nthat you are collecting that helps us identify that racial\ndisparity, why it is occurring and how we can address it?\nMr. Powell. Oh, there is lots and lots of research on that.\nWe would be happy to----\nSenator Cortez Masto. That you have? That you have access\nto?\nMr. Powell. Sure.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Perfect. That is what I am looking\nfor.\nMr. Powell. OK.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you.\nSenator Scott [presiding]. Senator Tillis.\nSenator Tillis. Thank you. Chair Powell, welcome back.\nThank you for a lot of the good work you are doing over in your\nlane.\nI do have a couple of questions. The first one that I want\nto talk about, we have seen particularly in the FDIC, a real\nstepped-up effort to take a look at guidance and other actions\nshort of an APA promulgated rule to rethink and revise or\nrescind. Can you give me an idea of how that is going on in the\nFed?\nMr. Powell. Sure. So, you know, we have forthrightly said\nthat guidance is not a rule; guidance is not binding; it is not\nthe basis for enforcement actions and things like that. And we\nhave made that very clear to our supervisors. So I think we\nare--you may have seen Vice Chair Quarles' speech where he\naddressed some of these issues, so we are working on that as\nwell.\nSenator Tillis. If we drill down, I know you are aware of\nthe GAO ruling on LISCC. There is a lot of talk here, I happen\nto agree with the discussion, that you all need to remain\nindependent, but there is something that concerns me that came\nout after you received the word from the GAO or OMB, and it\nrelates back to, I think, a letter your general counsel wrote\nback in June of last year, which I have it in front of me now.\nIt says that you are continuing to assess the scope of the\nFederal Reserve's obligation to send supervisory guidance\ndocuments to Congress under the CRA.\nDoes that mean you are exempt from that oversight?\nMr. Powell. So the question is whether we are required to\nsend guidance. We do send some guidance up, and, again, this is\nanother one that Vice Chair Quarles----\nSenator Tillis. So what is the current position on the\nLISCC consultation from the GAO? Is it taking LISCC down?\nMr. Powell. On LISCC, no, what we are going to do with\nLISCC is we are going to, I think, articulate clear standards\nfor what firms should be in LISCC. In fact, Vice Chair Quarles\nhas already laid out an approach which I think makes a lot of\nsense, which is LISCC should be for the U.S. G-SIBs, and really\ntry to tie the whole approach more to the tailoring categories\nthat we set up.\nSenator Tillis. Now to the other, CRA, the Community\nReinvestment Act. I have one question. Rumors swirl around this\nbuilding probably the way they do in the Fed and the whole of\nGovernment. So the question that I have relates to the Fed's\nplans for either joining with the FDIC and the OCC on the\nrulemaking. Some have said that you have provided an assurance\nto Waters that, without Governor Brainard's support, you would\nnot join into that. Is that just a rumor or an assurance you\nhave given Chair Waters?\nMr. Powell. That is not how we are looking at it. What we\nare doing is we are trying to develop--we developed our own\nthinking on CRA reform, as did the OCC. They took a lot of our\nideas, but in the end we were not able to get on the same page.\nAnd I am very comfortable with where we are now.\nSenator Tillis. What would be the rational basis for two\nstandards?\nMr. Powell. There are going to be two standards, anyway.\nUnder the FDIC/OCC proposal, about 70 percent of their\ninstitutions will be able to opt out of that standard. So there\nis going to be the existing standard, and then there will be\nthe new standard, assuming that they go forward with it. So\nthere will be two systems, and if we do not do anything, then\nwe will just be like the 70 percent of the institutions that\nthey supervise.\nSenator Tillis. Is Vice Chair Quarles on point for this?\nMr. Powell. Is he on point for this? He is----\nSenator Tillis. Wouldn't the Community Reinvestment Act be\nwithin his lane?\nMr. Powell. It is certainly broadly within all of our lanes\non the Board. We will all have to vote on this. This actually\nhas always been handled by a different group, which is DCCA,\nwhich Governor Brainard chaired, and I asked her to take the\nlead on this. But, ultimately, it comes down--I am very\ncomfortable with where we are on this.\nSenator Tillis. Thank you. I was going to ask some\nquestions similar to Senator Toomey's--I will not--on FedNow.\nBut I am going to submit some questions for the record that are\njust basically about the mechanics of the FedNow\nimplementation, five straightforward questions.\nThank you.\nSenator Scott. Thank you, Senator Tillis.\nSenator Jones.\nSenator Jones. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Powell, thank you for being here. Let me echo\nother colleagues on both sides of the aisle regarding the\nindependence of the Fed. I concur that it is extremely\nimportant that we maintain that independence.\nI want to ask you a little bit about home ownership. It\nkind of follows up a little bit with what Senator Kennedy was\ntalking about, wealth gaps between so many Americans. It seems\nthat nationwide home ownership is relatively stable, but there\nare also massive disparities in home ownership by age, race,\nand ethnicity. The African American home ownership rate fell to\na 50-year low in 2016 at just 41.7 percent. It remains about 30\npoints below white home ownership.\nSimilarly, the Hispanic home ownership rate is just 48\npercent. Again, far below the white or average home ownership\nrate.\nMillennials are less likely to own a home by age 34 than\ntheir parents and grandparents, and I am concerned that if\ntrends continue--and by that I mean to some extent we have got\nrelatively--wages are rising, but they have not been rising as\nfast as we would like. Home ownership costs are increasing at a\ngreater rate. So I am concerned that if these trends continue,\na growing number of Americans are just going to get locked out\nof home ownership.\nSo my question: What are the economic consequences in terms\nof both wealth building for minorities and the broader economy\nof leaving the disparity in the realm of home ownership\nunaddressed? And do you have suggestions of how we in Congress\nor the Fed can address home ownership?\nMr. Powell. Let me say first I would agree with you that\nthere are pressures on affordability which are very widespread\nthat have to do with difficulty in getting land zoned and\ndifficulty in acquiring workers and just costs, regulatory\ncosts, material costs, that are really putting pressure on\nhouse prices, upward pressure. And it is, as I said, quite\nwidespread around the country.\nYou know, in terms of the level of home ownership, I think\nwe do not want to be back in a situation where we push the idea\nof home ownership past what is financially sustainable for\npeople. We kind of did that in the precrisis era. So what has\nhappened is that credit is much less available now for people\nwithout spotless credit records, and that is a lot of what is\nbehind some of the data you cited. And I think it is a good\nquestion. Did we move too far? I do not have a view that we\ndid, but I think it is a good question to be asking on that,\nmaking sure that people who should have access to credit and\ncan handle borrowing of that size get it.\nSenator Jones. I know Senator Cortez Masto was asking--I\nwould like to get some of that same information, by the way,\nabout the racial disparities because I assume there is some\nconnection with that in economics as well.\nLet me, in the short time I have got left, go back to the\nlower rate of labor force participation. How can we just\nencourage that? How can we get more participation and get those\nnumbers up? What can we do, what can you do, if anything, to\ntry to get more folks in that participation in the market?\nMr. Powell. So what we can do is continue to use our tool\nto support a strong labor market, and it is very good to see\nthose participation rates rising to the levels that people did\nnot--I mean, economists did not think we would see those levels\nagain, and we are seeing them, which is a really positive\nthing.\nBut, you know, longer term, that is not really a strategy.\nWe need policies that will--ultimately, people have to have\nskills and aptitudes that will keep them in the labor force and\nways that they can take part in the labor force. And I think\nthat is where other Government policies come into effect. You\nknow, it is a lot of education and training and also policies\nthat will support attachment to the labor force. You know, we\nwould be happy to sit down with you and talk about that, but\nthat is important. Other countries that have leapfrogged us do\nmore of those kinds of things and also have had more rising\neducational attainment, which I think all of those things will\nhelp.\nSenator Jones. Great. Well, thank you for that, and I look\nforward to the discussion about that a little bit.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.\nChairman Crapo [presiding]. Thank you.\nSenator McSally.\nSenator McSally. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Powell, on February 2nd, the American Banker\npublished an article that was titled, ``When a Small Town Loses\nIts Only Bank''. The article mentions Duncan, Arizona, which\nhad only one bank and recently closed its doors. The residents\nof Duncan are now forced to drive approximately 40 miles to\nconduct any banking. Local businesses no longer have a place to\nmake daily deposits or get change, and any customer service\nissues require driving long distances.\nThe article states that, ``The economic implications are\nenough of a concern that the Federal Reserve has been studying\nwhat happens in areas where residents no longer have access to\na local branch.''\nSo my first question is: What has the Fed learned in that\nstudy? And why do you think this is happening? It is not just\nhappening in Duncan, Arizona, but really across rural Arizona\nand rural America.\nMr. Powell. So we published the study, as you mentioned. We\nhad meetings all around the country and did research, and I\nthink we did find that the loss of a branch, particularly in\nthese rural communities, can be a serious blow. It is the\navailability of financial services, but it is also that a bank\nis an important civic citizen and contributes in many ways to\nthat town.\nActually, I think Duncan--I think we had an event in\nDuncan. I think that was one of our events, now that I think of\nit. So we learned that, and you see it happening--bank branches\nare going down in--have been reduced in a number of\njurisdictions, but you see it more in rural----\nSenator McSally. Right.\nMr. Powell. And, also, the people who are in rural areas\nare more likely to--more inclined to use a bank branch rather\nthan electronic banking----\nSenator McSally. Exactly.\nMr. Powell. ----so the effects are really significant. So\nwe saw that, and it is quote a negative effect.\nSenator McSally. You know, these are banking deserts. How\ndoes the Fed define a ``banking desert''? Is it just about\ngeographic distance needing to travel or the number of\ncustomers or any other economic statistics for this? And you\nare absolutely right. More people in urban areas may be using\nonline banking. Rural areas have two challenges: one is they\nare possibly less inclined to do that, that is not part of the\nculture; but also we have connectivity challenges without rural\nbroadband. So those two things further hurt rural communities.\nSo how do you guys define ``banking deserts''? And what\nelse can be done to address this issue?\nMr. Powell. There is no accepted definition, but I think it\nis one of those things where you know it when you see it. So it\nis a place where people do not have access to basic banking\nservices. Duncan would be a classic example. The fact that you\nwould have to drive 40 miles to get there, that is a banking\ndesert. It turns out that many of these banking deserts are\nactually in the high desert, by the way, so that is another\nindicator.\nSenator McSally. Go figure.\nMr. Powell. But it is a real issue in rural America,\nprincipally.\nSenator McSally. Do you have any ideas within your role and\nour role on how we can address this issue?\nMr. Powell. So, you know, we cannot be in the business\nultimately of telling banks that, you know, they cannot close\nbranches.\nSenator McSally. Right.\nMr. Powell. But we can find incentives for them to support\nrural areas, and CRA reform may be one vehicle for that where\nwe can move--and this is a constructive aspect of the other\nagencies' proposal, is moving to support more activity of a CRA\nnature in rural areas. So that is one idea.\nIt is challenging, though. As you know, for quite a while\nnow, people have been leaving rural areas and moving to the\ncities, so these are longer-term demographic pressures.\nSenator McSally. Great. I appreciate it. I look forward to\nmaybe following up with you to talk more about this issue.\nMr. Powell. Glad to do it.\nSenator McSally. Thanks. I also want to touch on the labor\nforce participation and wage growth issue. I know many Members\nhave already asked you about it, but it is really great to see\nso many Americans and Arizonans coming off the sidelines and\ngetting back into the workforce, and we are starting to see,\nyou know, wages go up as well, especially for the lower levels\nof the economic spectrum.\nCan you just touch on a little bit more the dynamics that\nyou are seeing, the positive nature of that, and, you know,\nwhere you are seeing people coming off the sidelines and how\nwage increases are impacting?\nMr. Powell. Sure. So it is a combination of people just not\nleaving as much and people actually coming back in. As you may\nhave seen, unusually, at this point, most of the people who are\nnewly employed do not come out of unemployment. They come from\nout of the labor force. So we break down everybody into\ndifferent categories. The biggest flow I think by far now is\nfrom out of the labor force to employment, which is clearly a\nsign of relatively low unemployment. There are just fewer\npeople that are unemployed, but also just that there are people\nwho are outside the labor force who are having job\nopportunities. So that is very positive.\nThe thing is we did not expect this. It is very positive,\nand we just want to do whatever we can to continue to foster\nthis trend, because, you know, there is nothing like a job to\nget people's lives right and get them on a good track, so it is\nvery good to see this, and we are using our tools to make sure\nthat we can foster that.\nSenator McSally. Great. Thank you. I am out of time. Thank\nyou, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Crapo. Senator Van Hollen.\nSenator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you,\nChairman Powell, and like my colleagues, I want to thank you\nfor your accessibility, and I always appreciate the opportunity\nto have a fact-based conversation here.\nBefore I get to some of my questions, I just want to thank\nyou and the Fed for moving ahead on the FedNow system. I think\nit will save millions of Americans billions of dollars when it\nis implemented.\nNow, we passed a huge tax cut back in December of 2017. It\ndramatically increased the annual deficits and the long-term\ndebt. And at that time, in December 2017, here is what\nPresident Trump tweeted out. He said that his tax cuts were\ngoing to rock the economy to growth rates of 4 percent, 5\npercent, and maybe even 6 percent.\nMr. Chairman, the economy has not gotten anywhere near 6\npercent growth in the last 3 years, has it?\nMr. Powell. No. We have had continued moderate growth of a\nlittle better than 2 percent.\nSenator Van Hollen. Right, and we have not had growth at 5\npercent or 4 percent, and, in fact, the Trump administration\nhas not ever hit 3 percent annual growth, has it?\nMr. Powell. So 2018 was marked at 3 percent, but then got\nmarked down actually to 2\\1/2\\ percent. You never know. Maybe\nit will get----\nSenator Van Hollen. But we are having a reality-based\nconversation, so the answer is no, right? It has not hit 3\npercent; is that right?\nMr. Powell. According to the current statistics.\nSenator Van Hollen. Yeah. And if you look at the budget\nthat was just submitted by the Trump administration, they are\npredicting 2.8 percent growth for the coming year--again, very\nfar from what President Trump was talking about, 4, 5, 6\npercent. But even at that number, 2.8 percent, that is higher\nthan the most optimistic projections for the 2020 GDP from the\n17 FOMC members, right?\nMr. Powell. We do not have, you know, a unified forecast.\nWe do not adopt or vote on a forecast. But we do show a dot\nplot--of disclose data--and I think the median forecast would\nbe in the low 2s for FOMC participants for this year.\nSenator Van Hollen. Yeah, if I look at the median forecast,\nit is actually 2 percent, and the most optimistic bullish was\n2.3 percent, still a full half percent of GDP below the\nPresident's projections.\nSo let me now turn not from the aggregate numbers but to\nthe real wages, because there has been a lot of hype lately,\nbut I want to get a sense of where people really are. And,\nobviously, it is good news that the unemployment numbers have\ncontinued to come down on the trajectory they were following\nwhen President Trump was sworn in. But if you actually look at\nreal compensation--and I recall from an earlier hearing your\nview is that the Employment Cost Index, ECI, is probably the\nbest measure of compensation. Is that right?\nMr. Powell. In a sense it is. They all have their little\nvirtues, though.\nSenator Van Hollen. I just was looking at the numbers, and\ncompensation grew by an average of 0.94 percent per year during\nPresident Obama's second term, and that compares to 0.63\npercent per year. This is in inflation-adjusted terms, 0.63\npercent growth in compensation under President Trump. So, in\nfact, the real compensation that workers are getting in the\nworkforce was actually higher during Obama's last term compared\nto now.\nIs this a reflection of how difficult it has been to\nactually translate overall economic growth into higher real\nwages for Americans?\nMr. Powell. Yes, it is. I mean, part of that really is that\ninflation has moved back up a little bit, which is something we\nhave been actually trying to accomplish. But I think more\nbroadly, though, wages have moved up from about 2 percent to\nabout 3 percent now, and if you look at other expansions, even\nadjusting for productivity, you would have expected them to\nmove higher than that. So it is a bit of a surprise that we\nhave not seen real unit labor costs move up, which is to say\nthat people are getting paid more than productivity and\ninflation in what should be a tight labor market but is not\nshowing up as tight in wages.\nSenator Van Hollen. Exactly. And you say inflation went up,\nand that was the intention, but, of course, when it comes to\nreal purchasing power for Americans, that is what they care\nabout, whether their wages are able to make purchases.\nWe do not have time to get into it, but the budget did just\ncome up here. The Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee has\nannounced he does not want to have a hearing on the budget. I\nhope he will change his mind. But a lot of the cuts that were\nmade there include cuts to student loan opportunities and some\nof the things that you mentioned that actually could lead to\nhigher productivity in the economy. So I will follow up with\nsome written questions on that.\nSenator Van Hollen. Thank you.\nMr. Powell. Thank you.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you.\nSenator Cotton.\nSenator Cotton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for joining us\nagain. I want to speak today about the coronavirus and its\npotential impact on the U.S. and the global economy. Yesterday\nSenator Menendez and I and a couple other Senators introduced a\nresolution honoring Dr. Li Wenliang, a Chinese doctor who died\nlast week of coronavirus. What makes him unusually notable\namong the now more than 1,000 victims of the coronavirus is he\nwas one of the first persons to blow the whistle on the Wuhan\ncoronavirus in early December. He was silenced by the Chinese\nCommunist Party. In fact, he was summoned in the dark of night\nand forced to sign a statement denouncing his warnings. And,\nunfortunately, he contracted it and died, leaving behind, as I\nunderstand, a wife, a small child, and another child on the\nway.\nAnother example of these kind of practices I want to cite\nis the Chinese lawyer and journalist Chen Quishi. He was known\nfor reporting on the conditions in Wuhan. He has since\ndisappeared.\nI raise these examples, and I could multiply them at great\nlength, as just simple illustration of Chinese dishonesty and\nlack of transparency in trying to handle the effects of this\noutbreak. Obviously, that has a most important impact on our\nability to understand the virus and develop effective tests and\na vaccine for it. But what kind of effects does it have on you\nand the Fed's ability to try to understand the economic impact\nof it, dealing with such untransparent conditions coming out of\nBeijing, as you get a grasp of what the possible impact could\nbe for China, for the United States, and for the global\neconomy?\nMr. Powell. So as you point out, the real question for the\nFed is: What is the likely effect on the U.S. economy? And I\nthink we will begin to see it in economic data coming out\nfairly soon, and we do not--it is too uncertain to even\nspeculate about what the level of that will be and whether it\nwill be persistent or whether it will lead to a material change\nin the outlook. But we do expect that there will be some\neffects, and the effects should be substantial in China,\nimportant but maybe less substantial in their immediate trading\npartners. And we will know--we will be looking at the economic\ndata, and I cannot really comment on the other kinds of data.\nWe look at that, too, of course, carefully.\nSenator Cotton. And, of course, I would not expect that\nfrom the Federal Reserve. We get that from HHS and CDC and\nother agencies like that. Are Chinese economic or central bank\nofficials in contact with the Federal Reserve or their other\ncounterparts around the world to try to help you and your\ncounterparts understand that economic impact, though,\nrecognizing the dishonesty and lack of transparency of health\nofficials and political leaders?\nMr. Powell. I am absolutely sure that will be the case. You\nknow, there have been some conversations, but I think it is too\nearly to say. I think no one really knows. I think their focus\nnow--the big focus there is containing the outbreak. And, of\ncourse, the central bank and the Government itself, the rest of\nthe Government, have been undertaking lots of measures to\nsupport economic activity.\nI think certainly as they know more, we will know that,\ntoo. We, of course, have that kind of a relationship with their\ncentral bank.\nSenator Cotton. OK. I want to commend the Trump\nadministration for taking decisive action a couple weeks ago to\nstop travel from China and the other steps they have done in\nterms of contact tracing and trying to get testing kits out to\nthe front lines. Right now, as of this morning, I think we only\nhave 13 confirmed cases in the United States. I think we can be\nconfident there is more than that, but hopefully there will not\nbe many more. If that remains the case, if there is not a\nwidespread outbreak in the United States because of the actions\nthe U.S. Government took, is the main economic risk to the\nUnited States the fragility of supply chains that originate in\nChina? And what happens at the very beginning of those chains\nin factories which may not have any or sufficient workers?\nMr. Powell. You are right, supply chains is an important\nissue. We do get a lot of--we import a lot of sort of\nintermediate goods from China and final goods, too, and that\nwill be an issue. It will also be--our own exports there, of\ncourse, will be suppressed during this period. We will not get\nas much Chinese tourism. And then the other channel I would\nmention is just financial markets, which can create their own\ntransmission into the economy to the extent there are really\nstrong reactions in financial markets.\nSo we will be looking at all of that, and, again, we do\nexpect to start to pick it up relatively soon.\nSenator Cotton. OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Of course, far\nand away the top priority of our Government must be the health\nand safety of our people, but we do not want to lose sight of\nthe potential economic harm to our people's well-being and\nprosperity, so I appreciate your attention to this important\nmatter.\nChairman Crapo. Senator Menendez.\nSenator Menendez. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Powell,\nfor your service.\nLet me ask you something. The Northeast Corridor where I\ncome from--New Jersey, New York, that region--generates about\n20 percent of GDP for the entire Nation. If we had a major\ninfrastructure failure, for example, the closing of one or both\nof the Trans-Hudson tunnels into New York City, the end of the\nPortal Bridge, which is the linchpin that takes Boston to\nWashington throughout the Northeast Corridor, would that not\ncreate a significant economic risk?\nMr. Powell. If it were sustained, yes. If you are talking\nabout a sustained closing, that could. Things happen and then\nwe fix them, and they do not show up much in GDP. But if they\nare sustained, then yes.\nSenator Menendez. Well, let me just share with you\nsomething I would like to bring to your attention as you look\nat these issues. Amtrak estimates that a shutdown of the\nNortheast Corridor for a single day--for a single day, talk\nabout sustained issues--would cost our economy $100 million.\nAgain, that is just in 1 day. So if we cannot get this\ninfrastructure to ultimately be sustained--and we saw from\nSuperstorm Sandy tremendous damage to the Trans-Hudson tunnel.\nThey are both a century old. We have a century-plus bridge that\ndoes not close correctly, that stops the entire traffic across\nthe Northeast Corridor, so every lawyer, every medical patient,\nevery business that does intercity rail travel across from\nBoston to Washington get stopped and loses time, and if it\ncannot be closed successfully, they take sledgehammers to close\nit. That has a significant economic impact. And I would urge\nthe Fed to look at that as a question about our infrastructure\nneeds.\nThat is why I am so frustrated by the Administration not\nseeing the importance of what we call the ``Gateway Project'',\ntwo new Trans-Hudson tunnels, the rebuilding of the 109-year-\nold Portal Bridge. We just got some good news on that, but\noverall, this is a project of national significance in a region\nof the country that generates 20 percent of GDP for which\nintercity rail traffic is incredibly important.\nLet me turn to the Community Reinvestment Act, which I\nthink is an essential tool as one of the minority Members on\nthis Committee and in the Senate against discrimination, about\ncurbing redlining, meeting the needs of low- and moderate-\nincome families. However, instead of strengthening this\nimportant civil rights law, the OCC and the FDIC released a\nproposed rule that relies heavily on a dollar ratio metric for\nmeasuring all of the banks' CRA activities and gives little\nvalue to community input.\nMr. Chairman, why is it important for an updated CRA rule\nto focus on loan count rather than on dollar value of a loan?\nMr. Powell. In our thinking, loan counts are important\nbecause they go to the very purpose of the statute, which is to\nassure the provision of credit to low- and moderate-income\nindividuals and to their communities. So we think that loan\ncounts are an important aspect of that, in fact.\nSenator Menendez. Do you agree with Governor Brainard that\nfocusing on loan value, as the updated OCC and FDIC proposal\ndoes, ``runs the risk of encouraging some institutions to meet\nexpectations primarily through a few large community\ndevelopment loans or investments rather than meeting local\nneeds''?\nMr. Powell. I think it is a risk, and, you know, really, as\nyou know, we worked to try to get aligned, fully aligned with\nthat proposal. We were not able to get there. They were not\nable to get to our proposal either. So we are going to be\nlooking to see the comments on all those provisions which will\nbe coming in. We will be carefully looking at those as we think\nabout our path forward.\nSenator Menendez. So when you say that, did you, the\nReserve, share its concerns about emphasizing metrics that\nplace too much value on loan volumes and not on the community\ninput?\nMr. Powell. Yes, we shared all of our work, and we tried\nto--and they took many of our ideas, by the way. They\nincorporated a lot of our ideas. So----\nSenator Menendez. They did.\nMr. Powell. Yes, they did. But we were not able----\nSenator Menendez. Will you send us what particular items\nwere incorporated that you shared with them?\nMr. Powell. Sure, and Comptroller Otting has identified\nmany of them in his testimony in the House a couple weeks ago\nas ideas that they had incorporated from our work.\nSenator Menendez. But the key concern seems to have been\nignored, in particular, the one that----\nMr. Powell. So I think their proposal looks at both counts\nand dollars, but there are a number of differences, and----\nSenator Menendez. So a final question. Have either you or\nGovernor Brainard taken the CRA proposal to the Federal Reserve\nBoard yet?\nMr. Powell. No, we have not. Really, our focus was on\ntrying to get aligned around one proposal with the OCC and the\nFDIC, and now we see ourselves as waiting to learn more from\nthat process.\nSenator Menendez. Well, for those communities of color,\nthis is critically important, and I hope the Fed will show\nleadership in this regard and make sure that the community\nparticipation continues to be a hallmark of what the CRA is all\nabout.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you, and that concludes the\nquestions, although I am going to come back and ask one quick\nquestion that was not on my list to start with. You have been\nasked a lot, Mr. Chairman, today about wages, and I just want\nto verify a statistic with you that I am familiar with. My\nunderstanding is that wage growth was 3.1 percent last year.\nMr. Powell. That is average hourly earnings for the 12\nmonths ended December 31.\nChairman Crapo. And did that make 18 straight months that\nthe wage rate was above 3 percent, the wage growth rate?\nMr. Powell. I would have to check that. It certainly--it\ntakes you back--you really are not looking at each month. You\nare looking at it over the last--the level is 3.1 percent\nhigher. We could fact-check it. That sounds right, though. That\nsounds right.\nChairman Crapo. I think so. Well, if you would fact-check\nthat and let me know, I would appreciate it.\nMr. Powell. Will do.\nChairman Crapo. That does now conclude the questioning, and\nfor the Senators who wish to submit questions for the record,\nthose questions are due to the Committee by Wednesday, February\n19th. Chairman Powell, we ask that you respond to those\nquestions as promptly as you can. Again, we thank you for being\nhere.\nI am late for a vote, and I am sure you have other business\nto conduct, so this Committee is adjourned.\nMr. Powell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n[Whereupon, at 11:23 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]\n[Prepared statements, responses to written questions, and\nadditional material supplied for the record follow:]\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN MIKE CRAPO\nToday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will update the\nCommittee on monetary policy developments and the state of the U.S.\neconomy.\nThe U.S. economy continued to expand in 2019, exceeding 2 percent\ngrowth for the third straight year, as the American people enjoy the\nlongest continued economic expansion in American history.\nThe labor market is strong, with the labor force at an all-time\nhigh of 164 million people, and the most recent jobs report shows that\nemployers added 225,000 jobs in January with the unemployment rate at\n3.6 percent, remaining near a half-century low.\nWages also grew in January by 3.1 percent from a year earlier,\nmaking it 18 consecutive months that pay has grown at an annualized\npace of 3 percent or more.\nAmericans' view on their personal financial situations are\nincreasingly optimistic, according to Gallup trends. Nearly six in 10\nAmericans, or 59 percent, now say they are better off financially than\nthey were a year ago, up from 50 percent last year.\nTax reform in 2017, and right-sizing regulations--including under\nthe Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (S.\n2155) in 2018--have undoubtedly helped fuel this strong economy and\nlabor market.\nAmericans are set to benefit even more when considering the effects\nof USMCA and the Phase One Trade Deal with China.\nDespite this substantial progress, there are several external\nfactors that could have a meaningful impact on economic activity and\nour financial markets that need to be better understood, including:\nThe Fed's decision to maintain a significantly larger balance\nsheet in the future, including its recent decision to purchase\nTreasury bills in response to volatility in short-term\nborrowing rates;\nThe Fed's future plans to maintain stability in short-term\nborrowing rates, including potential structural, market-based\nfixes;\nThe risks of the transition away from LIBOR to an alternative\nreference rate, and steps that should be taken to ensure a\nsmooth transition and curb risks to businesses and financial\nmarkets; and\nThe potential impact of the coronavirus on global commerce and\ngrowth.\nThe Fed has also taken a number of important supervisory and\nregulatory actions that merit attention.\nThe Fed and other Federal financial agencies recently proposed\namendments to the Volcker Rule that would improve, streamline, and\nclarify the covered funds portion of the rule.\nThat proposal builds on the agencies' simplification of the Volcker\nRule in 2019, standing to improve market liquidity and preserve diverse\nsources of capital for businesses while striking the appropriate\nbalance with safety and soundness.\nAdditionally, many Banking Committee Republicans and I have raised\nserious concerns in the past with the agencies' supervisory and\nexamination processes, including the use of guidance as rules.\nIn January, Fed Vice Chairman Quarles offered a roadmap to foster\ntransparency, accountability, and fairness in bank supervision,\nincluding:\nTailoring the supervisory framework to better align with the\ncategories developed under the Fed's domestic and foreign bank\ntailoring rules;\nPutting significant supervisory guidance out for public comment\nand submitting it to Congress under the Congressional Review\nAct; and\nOther commonsense improvements to the supervisory process, such\nas a rulemaking that would cover the agencies use of guidance\nin the supervisory process.\nThis roadmap is greatly encouraging and I urge the Fed to take\nsteps to put it into motion.\nFinally, there is constant innovation, including in the financial\nservices industry, to increase resources to unbanked and underbanked\npopulations, reduce friction in payments and increase efficiency in the\ndelivery of financial products and services. Some recent examples are:\nFacebook's announcement of Libra, a new stable digital\ncryptocurrency backed by a reserve of real assets and\nleveraging blockchain technology;\nWork by global Governments and central banks to explore the\ndevelopment of central bank digital currencies, especially amid\nrumors that China's launch of a digital Yuan is imminent;\nThe numerous applications of distributed ledger technologies,\nincluding in clearing and settlement, identity verification and\ncross-border transactions; and\nSome financial institutions' adoption of public cloud\ntechnologies.\nAs I have stated in past hearings, it seems to me that\ntechnological innovations in this space are inevitable and the U.S.\nshould lead in developing what the rules of the road should be.\nDuring this hearing, I look forward to hearing your thoughts on\nthese important issues, and about work the Fed is engaged in to\nappropriately address them.\nChairman Powell, thank you for joining us today.\n______\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR SHERROD BROWN\nThank you, Chairman Crapo. Chair Powell, welcome back to the\nCommittee.\nBefore we start, I want to stay a few words about what happened\nlast night, which culminated with President Trump withdrawing the\nnomination of Jessie Liu, who was scheduled to appear before this\nCommittee tomorrow.\nI heard some of you, my colleagues and my friends, say that the\nPresident would be chastened by impeachment. Some of you told me you\nknew what he did was wrong, you admit he lies, but that this wasn't bad\nenough to rise to the level of removal from office--he'd learned his\nlesson.\nIt's pretty clear he's learned a lesson--the lesson he can do\nwhatever he wants, abuse his office, and he'll never, ever be held\naccountable.\nHe's gone on a retribution tour--starting at the prayer breakfast--\na prayer breakfast if you can believe that--continuing through the East\nRoom, where many of you were in the audience. He removed Col. Vindman,\na patriot and Purple Heart recipient who spent his life serving our\ncountry.\nHe removed Ambassador Sondland, a Trump appointee, after he\ntestified to the quid pro quo.\nAnd yesterday he continued the tour, interfering at the Department\nof Justice and strongarming political appointees to overrule career\nprosecutors. Those attorneys withdrew in protest--from the case, and in\nat least one case, resigned entirely from the Department entirely.\nWe cannot give him a permanent license to turn the presidency and\nthe Executive branch into his own personal vengeance operation. I'm\nafraid that is what we're seeing. No one should be above the law.\nNow, turning to the matter at hand. Welcome, Chair Powell.\nEarlier this week, Bloomberg reported on a profitable and fast-\ngrowing Spanish company. ``Grifols'' has opened up branches in 36\nStates. They buy and sell plasma--a nice, clinical sounding word that\nmeans ``blood.'' Americans who are struggling to make ends meet are\nlining up to sell their blood to put food on the table. The blood\nharvesting business is booming, and Grifols stock is doing great.\nIt's hard to think of a better metaphor for Trump's economy.\nOn Monday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both reached record highs. In\n2019, JPMorgan Chase had the best year for any U.S. bank in history,\nwith $36 billion in profits. Big corporations are spending hundreds of\nbillions of dollars on stock buybacks and dividends. On paper, the\neconomy has been expanding uninterrupted for over 10 years.\nBut if you talk to the vast majority of people who rely on\npaychecks, not investment portfolios to earn a living, you get a very\ndifferent story. They've been bleeding for years.\nMost families don't understand why the harder they work, sometimes\nat more than one job, the harder it's getting to afford pretty much\neverything--childcare, health care, rent, college tuition.\nThe people in this room may remember last September, when the\nfinancial industry went into a panic over a benchmark interest rate\npassing 10 percent.\nWall Street faced uncertainty, so the Fed leapt into action. Smart\nGovernment employees came up with a plan that led to the Federal\nReserve lending about $200 billion every day into financial markets\nthrough a mechanism that hasn't been used since the financial crisis.\nThat's right--$200 billion.\nLet me be clear--I don't think it's wrong for the Federal Reserve\nto be creative and make sure the economy keeps working. It's in\neverybody's interest for banks to keep lending money, and credit to\nkeep flowing so businesses can invest and manufacture, and consumers\ncan buy houses and cars.\nMy problem is this--when Main Street faces uncertainty, no one at\nthe Fed jumps to action or gets creative. And we certainly don't see\ntweets from the President demanding corporations raise wages for their\nworkers.\nIt's hard for families to understand why Wall Street gets worked up\nabout a 10 percent interest rate when so many families are lucky if the\npayday lender down the street charges them less than 400 percent.\nSmall businesses who are having trouble making payroll don't have\naccess to so-called repo funding at their local Fed branch. The Fed\ndoesn't take action when its own research has found that 40 percent of\nAmericans don't have the cash to cover a $400 expense in an emergency.\nNobody raises alarm bells when 40 million Americans predict they'll\nmiss at least one credit card payment, which means $1.2 billion in late\nfees will flow from the pockets of struggling families to\nultraprofitable banks.\n``Serious People'' haven't dropped everything to bring down the\ncost of housing or raise wages once they found out that one-in-four\nrenters are paying more than half their income toward housing.\nPeople look at that and they see two different economies--and two\ndifferent responses. We hear a lot about the divides in this country\nbetween Red and Blue, rural and urban, the coasts and the heartland--\nbut people in all those places feel like no matter how hard they work,\nthey can't maintain any real economic security. The real divide I see\nis between those whose problems are considered an ``emergency,'' and\nthose whose struggles Wall Street and large parts of Washington have\ndecided they can ignore.\nThe Fed needs to get creative for the people who make this country\nwork--particularly because it's become pretty clear that the President\nand the Majority Leader aren't about to.\nPresident Trump brags about a soaring stock market that he's pumped\nup with deficit-busting, trillion dollar tax breaks for billionaires--\nand now he wants to pay for those tax cuts by cutting Medicare and\nMedicaid and Social Security.\nHe lies about a ``blue collar boom,'' when in my own State of Ohio,\njob growth has been anemic or nonexistent, and manufacturing jobs are\nstalling compared to when he took office. And now he wants to kill a\nloan program that was giving the community of Lordstown a little bit of\nhope that manufacturing jobs would come back.\nChairman Powell, you and your highly capable staff at the Fed have\nbeen proactive and creative in protecting Wall Street and the money\nmarkets from this President's erratic behavior. And we're all\nappreciative of that.\nBut what I hope to hear from you today is how you're going to be\nproactive and use that same level of creativity to make this economy\nwork for everybody else.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\n______\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF JEROME H. POWELL\nChairman, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nFebruary 12, 2020\nChairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and other Members of the\nCommittee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual\nMonetary Policy Report.\nMy colleagues and I strongly support the goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability that Congress has set for monetary\npolicy. Congress has given us an important degree of independence to\npursue these goals based solely on data and objective analysis. This\nindependence brings with it an obligation to explain clearly how we\npursue our goals. Today I will review the current economic situation\nbefore turning to monetary policy.\nCurrent Economic Situation\nThe economic expansion is well into its 11th year, and it is the\nlongest on record. Over the second half of last year, economic activity\nincreased at a moderate pace and the labor market strengthened further,\nas the economy appeared resilient to the global headwinds that had\nintensified last summer. Inflation has been low and stable but has\ncontinued to run below the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC)\nsymmetric 2 percent objective.\nJob gains averaged 200,000 per month in the second half of last\nyear, and an additional 225,000 jobs were added in January. The pace of\njob gains has remained above what is needed to provide jobs for new\nworkers entering the labor force, allowing the unemployment rate to\nmove down further over the course of last year. The unemployment rate\nwas 3.6 percent last month and has been near half-century lows for more\nthan a year. Job openings remain plentiful. Employers are increasingly\nwilling to hire workers with fewer skills and train them. As a result,\nthe benefits of a strong labor market have become more widely shared.\nPeople who live and work in low- and middle-income communities are\nfinding new opportunities. Employment gains have been broad based\nacross all racial and ethnic groups and levels of education. Wages have\nbeen rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs.\nGross domestic product rose at a moderate rate over the second half\nof last year. Growth in consumer spending moderated toward the end of\nthe year following earlier strong increases, but the fundamentals\nsupporting household spending remain solid. Residential investment\nturned up in the second half, but business investment and exports were\nweak, largely reflecting sluggish growth abroad and trade developments.\nThose same factors weighed on activity at the Nation's factories, whose\noutput declined over the first half of 2019 and has been little\nchanged, on net, since then. The February Monetary Policy Report\ndiscusses the recent weakness in manufacturing. Some of the\nuncertainties around trade have diminished recently, but risks to the\noutlook remain. In particular, we are closely monitoring the emergence\nof the coronavirus, which could lead to disruptions in China that spill\nover to the rest of the global economy.\nInflation ran below the FOMC's symmetric 2 percent objective\nthroughout 2019. Over the 12 months through December, overall inflation\nbased on the price index for personal consumption expenditures was 1.6\npercent. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy\nprices, was also 1.6 percent. Over the next few months, we expect\ninflation to move closer to 2 percent, as unusually low readings from\nearly 2019 drop out of the 12-month calculation.\nThe Nation faces important longer-run challenges. Labor force\nparticipation by individuals in their prime working years is at its\nhighest rate in more than a decade. However, it remains lower than in\nmost other advanced economies, and there are troubling labor market\ndisparities across racial and ethnic groups and across regions of the\ncountry. In addition, although it is encouraging that productivity\ngrowth, the main engine for raising wages and living standards over the\nlonger term, has moved up recently, productivity gains have been subpar\nthroughout this economic expansion. Finding ways to boost labor force\nparticipation and productivity growth would benefit Americans and\nshould remain a national priority.\nMonetary Policy\nI will now turn to monetary policy. Over the second half of 2019,\nthe FOMC shifted to a more accommodative stance of monetary policy to\ncushion the economy from weaker global growth and trade developments\nand to promote a faster return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent\nobjective. We lowered the Federal funds target range at our July,\nSeptember, and October meetings, bringing the current target range to\n1\\1/2\\ to 1\\3/4\\ percent. At our subsequent meetings, with some\nuncertainties surrounding trade having diminished and amid some signs\nthat global growth may be stabilizing, the Committee left the policy\nrate unchanged. The FOMC believes that the current stance of monetary\npolicy will support continued economic growth, a strong labor market,\nand inflation returning to the Committee's symmetric 2 percent\nobjective. As long as incoming information about the economy remains\nbroadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary\npolicy will likely remain appropriate. Of course, policy is not on a\npreset course. If developments emerge that cause a material\nreassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.\nTaking a longer view, there has been a decline over the past\nquarter-century in the level of interest rates consistent with stable\nprices and the economy operating at its full potential. This low\ninterest rate environment may limit the ability of central banks to\nreduce policy interest rates enough to support the economy during a\ndownturn. With this concern in mind, we have been conducting a review\nof our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices.\nPublic engagement is at the heart of this effort. Through our Fed\nListens events, we have been hearing from representatives of consumer,\nlabor, business, community, and other groups. The February Monetary\nPolicy Report shares some of what we have learned. The insights we have\ngained from these events have informed our framework discussions, as\nreported in the minutes of our meetings. We will share our conclusions\nwhen we finish the review, likely around the middle of the year.\nThe current low interest rate environment also means that it would\nbe important for fiscal policy to help support the economy if it\nweakens. Putting the Federal budget on a sustainable path when the\neconomy is strong would help ensure that policymakers have the space to\nuse fiscal policy to assist in stabilizing the economy during a\ndownturn. A more sustainable Federal budget could also support the\neconomy's growth over the long term.\nFinally, I will briefly review our planned technical operations to\nimplement monetary policy. The February Monetary Policy Report provides\ndetails of our operations to date. Last October, the FOMC announced a\nplan to purchase Treasury bills and conduct repo operations. These\nactions have been successful in providing an ample supply of reserves\nto the banking system and effective control of the Federal funds rate.\nAs our bill purchases continue to build reserves toward levels that\nmaintain ample conditions, we intend to gradually transition away from\nthe active use of repo operations. Also, as reserves reach durably\nample levels, we intend to slow our purchases to a pace that will allow\nour balance sheet to grow in line with trend demand for our\nliabilities. All of these technical measures support the efficient and\neffective implementation of monetary policy. They are not intended to\nrepresent a change in the stance of monetary policy. As always, we\nstand ready to adjust the details of our technical operations as\nconditions warrant.\nThank you. I am happy to take your questions.\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR BROWN\nFROM JEROME H. POWELL\nQ.1. In 2016, the Board of Governors, along with the FDIC and\nOCC, released a report to Congress and FSOC on the activities\nand investments banking entities may engage in under State and\nFederal law. That report states that supervisory oversight for\nFHCs engaging in physical commodities activities can include\n``review of the management of risks of those activities to the\nFHCs'' and an assessment of ``adequacy of the firms' controls\nrelating to physical commodities activities.'' The report also\nmentions supervisory scrutiny related to merchant banking\nactivities, complementary activities, and investments. The\nreport also makes recommendations to Congress, including\nrepealing the authority of FHCs to engage in merchant banking\nand commodities activities, and eliminating the ILC exemption.\nAn investment vehicle with significant ties to JPMorgan\nChase has filed an application with FERC to purchase an El Paso\nfranchise utility. Has the Board reviewed potential risks,\npursuant to the supervisory activities referenced in the 2016\nreport, of this purchase to JPMC?\nHas the board shared any of its supervisory documents\nrelated to reviews of JPMorgan Chase or the Infrastructure\nInvestment Fund with FERC?\nDoes the Board stand by its 2016 recommendations to\nCongress?\nWould IIF's purchase of the El Paso utility help or hinder\nFederal banking agencies' stated desire to reduce safety and\nsoundness concerns raised by financial holding companies'\nexposure to risks related to physical commodities, merchant\nbanking, covered investments, and complementary activities?\nWhat authorities does the Board have related to the\napproval of this merger and/or the permissibility of JPMC's\nrelationship with IIF?\nA.1. The Federal Reserve's supervisory responsibility is to\noversee the financial soundness of financial holding companies\n(FHC) and their adherence to applicable banking laws. To this\nend, the Federal Reserve monitors the largest of these\ninstitutions on a continuous basis and routinely conducts\ninspections and examinations of all of these firms to encourage\ntheir safe and sound operation. This supervision includes\ninstitutions' activities, including merchant banking and\nphysical commodities activities. To conduct physical\ncommodities activities pursuant to section 4(k) of the Bank\nHolding Company Act (e.g., trading on the spot market), a\nfinancial institution must obtain prior approval of the Federal\nReserve Board (Board). However, pursuant to the Gramm-\nLeach centsliley Act, a FHC may make a merchant banking\ninvestment in a company that engages in physical commodities\nactivities without prior approval. In addition, some firms are\npermitted by law to engage directly in a broad range of\nphysical commodity activities, including the extraction,\nstorage, and transportation of commodities. Specifically,\nsection 4(o) of the Bank Holding Company Act may permit a\ncertain FHCs to own, operate, or invest in facilities for the\nextraction, transportation, storage, or distribution of\ncommodities, or to process or refine commodities, if certain\nstatutory conditions are met regarding eligibility. To date,\nonly two banking organizations--Goldman Sachs and Morgan\nStanley--have qualified to engage in physical commodities\nactivities under section 4(o).\nThe Board began its review of the physical commodities\nactivities of FHCs after an increase in these activities among\nFHCs during the financial crisis. The Board's review included\nan advance notice of proposed rulemaking in January of 2014,\nfollowed by a notice of proposed rulemaking in September 2016.\nThe Board received a large number of comments from a variety of\nperspectives in response to both notices. The Board continues\nto consider the proposal in light of the many comments received\nand, as discussed above, continues to monitor the physical\ncommodities activities of FHCs. The Board believes that the\nstrong postcrisis regulatory and supervisory regime helped\naddress financial risks from merchant banking activities,\nincluding market, liquidity, and credit risks. In terms of the\n2016 recommendation in the section 620 report, I would need to\ndiscuss those recommendations with the current members of the\nBoard and consider that recommendation in light of developments\nsince the report was issued, as well as current facts and\ncircumstances.\nQ.2. On December 17, 2019, the Board and the FDIC announced\nthey had found ``no deficiencies'' in the resolution plans\nrequired under 165(d) of the Wall Street Reform Act. Do you\nbelieve that Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon,\nCitigroup, Morgan Stanley, State Street, Wells Fargo, Goldman\nSachs, and JPMorgan Chase could each be resolved in an orderly\nbankruptcy without affecting financial stability?\nDo you believe that Bank of America could be resolved in an\norderly bankruptcy without affecting financial stability?\nDo you believe that Bank of New York Mellon could be\nresolved in an orderly bankruptcy without affecting financial\nstability?\nDo you believe that Citigroup could be resolved in an\norderly bankruptcy without affecting financial stability?\nDo you believe that Morgan Stanley could be resolved in an\norderly bankruptcy without affecting financial stability?\nDo you believe that State Street could be resolved in an\norderly bankruptcy without affecting financial stability?\nDo you believe that Wells Fargo could be resolved in an\norderly bankruptcy without affecting financial stability?\nDo you believe that Goldman Sachs could be resolved in an\norderly bankruptcy without affecting financial stability?\nDo you believe that JPMorgan Chase could be resolved in an\norderly bankruptcy without affecting financial stability?\nA.2. The identified banking organizations have made substantial\ngains in their resiliency and resolvability since the financial\ncrisis, in part due to the work that the Federal Reserve and\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have done on\nresolution plans. An important aspect of enhancing the\nresiliency and resolvability of banking organizations is making\nresolution planning an ongoing institutional aim. The\ndevelopment of resolution plans has resulted in firms\nrationalizing their structures, creating resolution strategies\nand mechanisms for their successful implementation, identifying\nand marshaling necessary resources, and considering\nresolvability as part of day-to-day decision-making. While\nthese measures cannot guarantee that a firm's resolution would\nbe simple or smoothly executed, the preparations have\nsignificantly improved the chances that any of the firms could\nbe resolved under bankruptcy without Government support or\nimperiling the broader financial system. Nevertheless, given\nthe uncertainties around how financial crises unfold, the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act's orderly\nliquidity authority remains a valuable backstop resolution\nframework.\nQ.3. When the Committee was considering S. 2155, you stated\nthat the bill wouldn't require deregulating foreign banks. But\nin the Fed's October 2019 rule, you state that the Fed was\nrequired to weaken requirements for foreign banks because the\nlaw requires you to treat them similarly to domestic banks (``\n. . . the Dodd-Frank Act directs the Board to give due regard\nto the principle of national treatment and equality of\ncompetitive opportunity . . . '' and ``the final rule\nfacilitates a level playing field between foreign and U.S.\nbanking organizations operating in the United States, in\nfurtherance of the principle of national treatment and equality\nof competitive opportunity'').\nWhen you testified in front of the Banking Committee, were\nyou or your staff aware of the Dodd-Frank directive requiring\nthe Board to give ``due regard to the principle of national\ntreatment and equality of competitive opportunity''? If so, how\ndid that directive factor into your interpretation that S. 2155\nwould not require the Board to weaken regulations for foreign\nbanks?\nA.3. Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in response\nto the financial crisis and directed the Board to establish\nenhanced prudential standards for large bank holding companies\nand foreign banking organizations. As you observed, in applying\nenhanced prudential standards to foreign banking organizations,\nsection 165(b)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act directs the Board to\n``give due regard to the principle of national treatment and\nequality of competitive opportunity'' The Board recognizes the\nimportant role that foreign banking organizations play in the\nU.S. financial sector. The provision of the Dodd-Frank Act\nconcerning national treatment did not mandate that the Board\nmake any changes to the enhanced prudential standards as\napplied to foreign banking organizations in light of the\nEconomic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection\nAct. In issuing the final tailoring rule concerning the\napplication of the enhanced prudential standards to foreign\nbanking organizations, the Board took into account the risks\nposed by those organizations as well as how the rule treated\nsimilarly situated domestic organizations. The final tailoring\nrule appropriately applies requirements based on the nature of\nthose risks. The Board remains committed to the principle of\nnational treatment and equality of competitive opportunity\nbetween the U.S. operations of foreign banking organizations\nand U.S. banking organizations.\nIn particular, the enhanced prudential standards applied to\nthe U.S. operations of foreign banks under the Board's final\ntailoring rule are consistent with the standards applicable to\nU.S. bank holding companies. The standards take into account\nthe extent to which a foreign bank is subject, on a\nconsolidated basis, to home country standards that are\ncomparable to those applied to financial companies in the\nUnited States. Specifically, the final rule continues the\nBoard's approach of tailoring the application of prudential\nstandards to foreign banks based on the foreign bank's U.S.\nrisk profile. For foreign banks with significant U.S.\noperations, the tailoring final rule applies a framework that\nis consistent with the framework applied to U.S. banking\norganizations. By using consistent indicators of risk, the\nfinal rule facilitates a level playing field between foreign\nbanks and U.S. banking organizations operating in the United\nStates, in furtherance of the principle of national treatment\nand equality of competitive opportunity.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SCOTT\nFROM JEROME H. POWELL\nQ.1. Last week we all heard the President lay out all the ways\nthis economy is booming and most importantly, working for\neveryone and not just the few at the top. Unemployment for\nminorities is down, unemployment for veterans is down, wage\ngrowth is rising faster for those at the bottom than for those\nat the top, labor force participation is rising, and household\nincome has never been higher.\nIn particular, black home ownership (4Q 2008 46.8 percent;\n4Q 2016 41.7 percent; 4Q 2019 44.0 percent) and black labor\nparticipation (Dec 2018 63.5 percent; Dec 2016 61.9 percent;\nJan 2020 62.9 percent) have also increased!\nThis doesn't even begin to touch on all the other important\nmetrics that show how tax cuts and deregulation have helped\npropel American families into a time of economic prosperity.\nEnsuring not only my constituents in South Carolina, but\nthose coast-to-coast, have the ability and access to more\naffordable credit is paramount. Often times, this is to\npurchase things like a home, a car, or an education. Things\nthat require larger loans in order to invest in yourself.\nBut, there are also times when Americans need access to\ncredit in order to just make ends meet. This could be a $500\nloan to pay rent or $1000 for an unexpected car repair. Small-\ndollar loans are an instrument of good and we should work to\nkeep the access for those loans available while increasing\ntheir affordability and soundness.\nI understand that the FDIC has been working together with\nthe Fed and OCC to find ways to improve access to small-dollar\nloans at a more reasonable cost.\nPlease answer the following with specificity:\nDo you believe that affordable access to small-dollar loans\ncould help a significant number of Americans?\nA.1. On May 20, the Federal Reserve, along with the Office of\nthe Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation, and National Credit Union Administration (the\nagencies), issued small-dollar lending principles for financial\ninstitutions offering small-dollar loans in a responsible\nmanner to meet customers' short-term credit needs. In issuing\nthe principles, the agencies recognized the important role that\nresponsibly offered small-dollar loans can play in helping\ncustomers meet their ongoing needs for credit from temporary\ncash-flow imbalances, unexpected expenses, or income\nshortfalls, including during periods of economic stress,\nnatural disasters, or other extraordinary circumstances such as\nthe public health emergency created by COVID-19. The principles\nfollow a statement issued on March 26, 2020, by the agencies\nand the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) encouraging\nbanks, savings associations, and credit unions to offer\nresponsible small-dollar loans to consumers and small\nbusinesses in response to COVID-19.\nQ.2. I am focused on finding ways we can encourage small-dollar\nlending to give Americans needed access to credit through\nresponsible products that do not trap them in a cycle of debt.\nI was encouraged to see that Federal Reserve Governor Bowman\nraised an important issue this week, talking about the\nimportance of the Fed implementing clear third party guidance\nthat is consistent across all of the Federal regulatory\nagencies.\nCan you give us an update on the work you have been doing\nwith the FDIC and OCC on this and what you believe possible\nregulatory outcomes might look like in order to encourage banks\nto provide these small-dollar loans, and the benefits that\ncommunity bankers see by innovating and working with FinTech\nplatforms?\nA.2. The small-dollar lending principles referred to above that\nwere issued by the agencies on May 20, encourage supervised\nbanks, savings associations, and credit unions to offer\nresponsible small-dollar loans to customers for both consumer\nand small business purposes. The agencies recognize that\nfinancial institutions are well suited to meet small-dollar\ncredit needs and some already offer these products, consistent\nwith safe and sound principles and subject to applicable laws\nand regulations. Further, the principles state that small-\ndollar lending programs could include effectively managed\ndeployment of innovative technology or processes for customers\nwho may not meet a financial institution's traditional\nunderwriting standards, and that programs can be implemented\nin-house or through effectively managed third-party\nrelationships. And finally, that any products offered through\neffectively managed third-party relationships would also\nreflect the core lending principles, including returns\nreasonably related to the financial institution's risks and\ncosts.\nQ.3. Governor Bowman talked about the need to implement\nguidance; can you explain the pros and cons of using guidance\nin this area versus a rulemaking? And, how do we balance the\nneed to create real rules of the road to encourage the small-\ndollar lending we need without creating barriers to entry?\nA.3. The Federal Reserve has long supported responsible small-\ndollar lending to meet customers' needs. Consistent with that\nview, we believe the principles issued on May 20 give financial\ninstitutions flexibility to structure their program in a manner\nthat is safe and sound, fair to borrowers, and consistent with\napplicable laws and regulations. We also note that the CFPB has\nconsumer rulewriting authority, and we are actively monitoring\nthe status of the CFPB's open payday rulemaking proposal.\nQ.4. I'm sure you're familiar with my continued interest in the\nInternational Association of Insurance Supervisors' work on the\nICS. I've made the point to Vice Chair Quarles that the U.S.\ninsurance market fulfills a vastly different purpose than the\nEuropean market--it doesn't make sense to regulate our insurers\nwith foreign rules of the road. Doing so will compromise the\nability of my constituents to plan for their retirement or\nmanage their finances over the long term.\nThere's now a concrete path for the U.S. insurance solvency\nsystem to be deemed equivalent to the ICS.\nGiven all of the hard work you are doing at the Fed on the\nBuilding Block Approach (BBA) and the State Insurance\nCommissioners are doing on the Group Capital Calculation\n(GCC)--\nPlease answer the following with specificity:\nHow do you plan on ensuring the standards being developed\nin the U.S. will be deemed equivalent by the IAIS given the\ncontinued resistance you are facing from the Europeans?\nA.4. The Federal Reserve has consistently maintained that the\nEuropean insurance capital regulation is not appropriate for\nthe U.S. insurance markets, particularly our market for long-\nterm products. Instead, we advocate for the U.S. approach to\ninsurance regulation at the International Association of\nInsurance Supervisors (IAIS). As part of this advocacy, the\nU.S. members of the IAIS are developing an aggregation\nalternative to the Insurance Capital Standard (ICS), which\nbuilds on our work on the Building Block Approach and the\nNational Association of Insurance Commissioner's work on the\nGroup Capital Calculation. During the recent IAIS negotiations\nin Abu Dhabi, we agreed to a plan that creates a concrete path\nfor the U.S. system to be recognized as equivalent. Under this\nplan, the IAIS will consult on the approach for assessing\ncomparability in 2020 and 2021, finalize the approach in 2022,\nand then conduct the comparability assessment of the\naggregation alternative. The Federal Reserve will continue to\nadvocate for the U.S. approach at each of these decision\npoints.\nQ.5. I think we can agree that less unnecessary regulation is\nalways better. But what's best for everyone is smart\nregulation. Regulations intended to appropriately capture and\ncapitalize risk. We continue to hear that with regards to the\nFRTB (the capital treatment for trading instruments) the Fed\nhas taken their goal of simplicity as license to remove risk\nsensitivity and increase capital.\nThe U.S. capital markets are core to the economic fabric\nand our global prowess; in fact the capital markets fund 65\npercent of economic activity in the U.S.\nPlease answer the following with specificity:\nCan you ensure that U.S. regulators will right size this in\nthe U.S. rulemaking?\nA.5. The 2007-2008 financial crisis revealed weaknesses in the\nU.S. financial system--too little capital, not enough liquid\nassets, and poor risk management. Since that time, the Federal\nReserve Board (Board) and the other Federal banking agencies\nhave substantially strengthened regulatory capital and\nliquidity requirements for large banks, which has significantly\nincreased the financial resiliency of these firms and the\nfinancial system as a whole. For example, firms subject to the\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review in 2019 increased\ntheir aggregate ratio of common equity capital to risk-weighted\nassets from 4.9 percent in the first quarter of 2009 to 12.3\npercent in the fourth quarter of 2018. This change reflects a\ntotal increase of approximately $660 billion in common equity\ncapital, bringing total CET1 capital at these firms to over $1\ntrillion in the fourth quarter of 2018. In October 2019, the\nBoard finalized its tailoring rule, which more closely matches\nthe regulations applicable to large banking organizations with\ntheir risk profile.\nWe agree that regulations should evolve to keep pace with\nchanges in the financial system and changes in risk. The\nrevised Basel III framework, including the Fundamental Review\nof the Training Book (FRTB), is intended to deliver credible\ncapital outcomes by increasing the robustness and risk\nsensitivity of the overall capital framework, and to promote\nconsistent implementation of the standards across\njurisdictions. Board staff is currently working on a proposal\nto implement FRTB. As we further develop this proposal, we will\nconsider the benefits of increased risk sensitivity, as well as\nthe important objectives of simplicity, transparency,\nefficiency, and safety and soundness. We will also aim to\nensure that the proposal is appropriately tailored to the risk\nprofile of banking organizations.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR COTTON\nFROM JEROME H. POWELL\nQ.1. In today's hearing, you spoke about the transition from\nLIBOR and how a number of banks have said they'd like to work\non a rate that is separate from SOFR, i.e., a rate that is\ncredit sensitive (as is LIBOR). I was glad to hear you mention\nthat the Federal Reserve is working with those banks to support\ntheir efforts to use a credit-sensitive rate. Is Ameribor\nappropriate to use for institutions for whom it more accurately\nrepresents their cost of funding?\nPut another way, does the Fed support alternative benchmark\ninterest rates to SOFR such as Ameribor--for the replacement of\nLibor?\nA.1. The Federal Reserve convened and supports the work of the\nAlternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) and views SOFR as\na robust alternative that will help many market participants in\nthe transition away from LIBOR. However, we have been clear\nthat the ARRC's recommendations and the use of SOFR are\nvoluntary and that market participants should seek to\ntransition away from LIBOR in the manner that is most\nappropriate given their specific circumstances.\nAmeribor is a reference rate created by the American\nFinancial Exchange based on a cohesive and well-defined market\nthat meets the International Organization of Securities\nCommission's (IOSCO) principles for financial benchmarks. While\nit is a fully appropriate rate for the banks that fund\nthemselves through the American Financial Exchange or for other\nsimilar institutions for whom Ameribor may reflect their cost\nof funding, it may not be a natural fit for many market\nparticipants.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR PERDUE\nFROM JEROME H. POWELL\nQ.1. Fed Inflation Targeting--Since 2012, the FOMC has adopted\nan inflation target of 2 percent as part of its Longer-Run\nGoals and Monetary Policy Strategy. But as you mentioned in\nyour opening statement, PCE inflation, which the Federal\nReserve targets, was 1.6 percent last year, under your 2\npercent target once again. It has been running under this 2\npercent target for almost a decade now. As part of the\nmotivation for the review of the Federal Reserve's policy\nstrategy, many Governors, including yourself, have expressed\nconcern over the disinflationary pressures occurring across the\nglobe. If inflation expectations are anchored persistently\nlower, your interest rate policy could become less effective\nand give the Federal Reserve less room to cut in the face of\nfuture recession.\nAs the Federal Reserve continues their review, are you\nconsidering alternative monetary policy frameworks, such as\nNGDP targeting, that would allow for more variability in\ninflation around the 2 percent target, including above that\ntarget?\nA.1. Consideration of alternative monetary policy frameworks\nhas certainly been part of our ongoing review of monetary\npolicy strategy, tools, and communication practices. This\nreview is concerned with considering ways in which the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) can best achieve its dual mandate\ngoals of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation in the\nmodern-day environment--in which interest rates are likely, for\nstructural reasons, to be lower, on average, than in past\nhistorical experience.\nWith regard to the alternative strategies considered during\nthe review, the published minutes for the FOMC meetings of the\npast year have described the strategies on which the FOMC has\nbeen briefed by Federal Reserve staff and which it has\ndiscussed in its deliberations in connection with the review.\nWe have not discussed nominal GDP (NGDP) targeting in detail\nduring this review process, as NGDP has a very imperfect\nrelationship with our statutory goals of maximum employment and\nprice stability.\nQ.2. Do you believe any of these alternative approaches outside\nyour current 2 percent inflation target would allow the Federal\nReserve to better achieve your congressional mandate and to\nhelp mitigate the lower bound problem?\nA.2. The proximity of the neutral policy interest rate to the\neffective lower bound (ELB) in the past decade was a key\nmotivation for the Federal Reserve's monetary policy framework\nreview of the past year. In the course of the FOMC's\ndiscussions during this review, we have considered how the\nchoice among different strategies affects the Federal Reserve's\nability to provide the desired amount of monetary policy\naccommodation at or near the ELB. The FOMC has not yet reached\nany conclusion about changes to our strategy that might arise\nfrom the review process. All the alternative strategies that we\nhave considered, however, are premised on our continuing to\nhave a 2 percent longer-run inflation objective as our price-\nstability goal, alongside our maximum-employment goal. This\nreview is concerned with considering ways in which the FOMC can\nbest achieve these dual-mandate goals in the environment of\npersistently low interest rates.\nIn terms of achieving the FOMC's dual mandate goals, it is\nalso important to stress that when the policy rate is in the\nvicinity of the ELB, the set of monetary policy tools\navailable, and not just the choice of monetary policy strategy,\nis important. During the framework review of the past year, the\nFOMC has discussed its experience with its two main monetary\npolicy tools at the ELB: forward guidance regarding the policy\nrate; and asset purchases (or balance sheet policy). We have\nconsiderable confidence in the effectiveness of these tools. We\nbelieve that they have proven their worth as valuable and\nuseful means of providing additional monetary policy\naccommodation in ELB conditions.\nQ.3. Also, do you believe the current framework properly allows\nfor productivity and commodity shocks or would an alternative\nsystem allow for broader flexibility?\nA.3. A recognition of the importance of productivity shocks and\ncommodity shocks, and a consideration of their implications for\nthe economy, are important for the appropriate formulation of\nmonetary policy. The current monetary policy framework takes\nthese shocks into account satisfactorily. Any alternative\nframework that the FOMC might consider would similarly need to\ntake appropriate account of these types of shocks.\nQ.4. Basel III Revisions--Chair Powell, in the postcrisis\nworld, the U.S. banks have worked to improve both their capital\nand liquidity standards. With the Federal Reserve now working\nto incorporate Basel III revisions into the U.S. regulatory\nframework, I am concerned that if the implementation is not\ndone with a holistic view, these changes could have a\ncompounding effect, placing far greater capital and liquidity\nconstraints on financial institutions.\nFor example, one of my greatest concerns is that the new\nrevisions would have a lasting impact in terms of capital\nmarkets activity and the cost of raising capital for U.S.\nfirms. This is particularly significant because unlike our\nEuropean counterparts on the BCBS (Basel Committee on Banking\nSupervision), roughly two-thirds of all U.S. lending occurs in\nour capital markets. Furthermore, we have a deeper and more\nsophisticated capital markets structure than our counterparts\naround the world.\nWould you share your views on how capital requirements on\ncapital markets activities could impact the balance between\nbank-driven and market-driven finance in the U.S. financial\nsystem?\nA.4. The financial crisis revealed weaknesses in the U.S.\nfinancial system--too little capital, not enough liquid assets,\nand poor risk management. Since the financial crisis, the\nbanking agencies have increased the financial resiliency of\nbanking organizations by substantially strengthening their\nregulatory capital and liquidity requirements. The final Basel\nIII framework, which includes standards for market risk and\ncapital market activities, is designed to produce a more robust\nregulatory framework for the largest firms and to promote\nconsistent implementation of the standards across international\njurisdictions.\nThe Board of Governors (Board) recognizes the importance of\ncapital markets and market-based finance in supporting economic\nactivity in the United States. Because there is a close link\nbetween market liquidity and banking organizations' funding\nliquidity, robust capital and liquidity requirements help\nensure that banking organizations can maintain their financial\nintermediation functions in times of financial distress.\nConsistent with the banking agencies' efforts to tailor the\napplication of prudential rules to the risk profiles of firms,\nthe Board will consider the implementation of the Basel III\nstandards in light of its objectives to enhance the simplicity,\ntransparency, and efficiency of the overall regulatory\nframework. The Board will consider the impact of any future\nrulemakings on firms and the markets to ensure that the Board's\ncapital and liquidity framework continues to support the safety\nand soundness of banking organizations and U.S. financial\nstability.\nQ.5. Additionally, would you please outline the specific steps\nthat the Fed is taking to ensure that these provisions are not\ndone piecemeal and that overall capital is not meaningfully\nchanged or increased--as you have repeatedly stated that you\nbelieve current capital levels are ``about right.''\nA.5. The Board is paying close attention to the overall\ncoherence of the regulatory capital framework. The Board\nrecently finalized the stress capital buffer requirement, which\nsimplifies the capital regime by integrating the Board's stress\ntest and point-in-time capital requirements while maintaining\nthe current strong levels of capital. Board staff are also\nactively considering how the final Basel III standards could be\nimplemented in a way that maintains overall capital and\nliquidity requirements at large banking organizations, avoids\nadditional burden at smaller banking organizations, and\nsupports the principles of transparency and due process. It is\nimportant for the Board to consider the remaining elements of\nthe Basel III framework (especially the operational risk\nelement and the fundamental review of the trading book) as a\nwhole, and then examine that whole in the context of the\nexisting framework.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR TILLIS\nFROM JEROME H. POWELL\nQ.1. I am encouraged that Federal Reserve staff are working to\nupdate the rules governing margin eligibility of certain over-\nthe-counter securities to better reflect developments in the\nOTC marketplace since Nasdaq became an exchange. Please provide\nme with an update on the progress to date, how the Federal\nReserve is contemplating updates to the rules, and the expected\ntiming of changes to the rules.\nA.1. Federal Reserve staff are developing a proposal that would\nmake certain domestic and foreign over-the-counter (OTC)\nsecurities marginable at broker-dealers under the Federal\nReserve Board's (Board) Regulation T. Board staff will consult\nwith other securities regulatory authorities before the Board\npublishes a proposal for public comment.\nQ.2. HSBC has just announced a major restructuring that\nincludes a significant reduction in its U.S. presence, and as a\nresult a significant reduction in the capital it will provide\nU.S. corporations and the services it will provide U.S.\nconsumers. On the global markets side, HSBC has determined that\nits U.S. returns are unacceptably low relative to what it can\nearn in other markets, primarily Asia, and announced that it\nwill reduce its U.S. risk-weighted assets in those businesses\nby 45 percent; it will increase its presence in Asia in a\ncorresponding amount. On the retail side, it will focus in the\nUnited States only on international, affluent, and globally\nmobile clients; it will continue to provide retail services to\nthe U.K., Hong Kong, and Mexico. Do you believe this outcome is\na good one for the United States? Given that HSBC is the\nworld's largest trading bank, what do you believe the economic\nsignificance will be of its shift from the U.S. market to Hong\nKong, where its primary clients will be in China? What role did\nthe regulatory regime you impose on HSBC play in its decision?\nA.2. The Federal Reserve promotes the safety and soundness of\nindividual banking institutions, including foreign banking\norganizations (FBOs) operating in the United States, and\nmonitors their impact on the financial system as a whole.\nIn supervising the U.S. operations of FBOs, the Federal\nReserve monitors and reviews their U.S. business strategies in\norder to ensure that they comply with applicable U.S. laws and\nregulations, and are commensurate with each institution's risk\nappetite and risk management capabilities. As you are aware,\nthe global operations of FBOs are supervised by their\nrespective home-country regulators.\nThe presence of FBOs in the United States brings\ncompetitive benefits to U.S. markets, as these firms serve as a\nsource of credit to U.S. households and businesses as well as\ncontribute to the strength and liquidity of U.S. financial\nmarkets. However, given that the large population of FBOs still\nrepresent only a segment of the U.S. financial system, and is\nstructurally and characteristically diverse, any strategic\nshift of a single FBO would not necessarily impact the\navailability of banking services to U.S. households and\nbusinesses.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR REED\nFROM JEROME H. POWELL\nQ.1. Since 2019, the Federal Reserve has been engaged in a\nreview of its monetary policy, strategy, tools, and\ncommunications practices. Could you please share what you have\nlearned so far? What can I share with my constituents back home\nwho are looking for jobs, especially those Rhode Islanders who\nare looking for jobs that pay fair and livable wages?\nA.1. An important aspect of the Federal Reserve's review of\nmonetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices\nhas been a series of Fed Listens events during which\npolicymakers heard from a broad range of stakeholders in the\nU.S. economy about labor market conditions, inflation, and\ninterest rates. From these events, we have learned that the\ntight labor market conditions in 2019 were important for\nproviding job opportunities to individuals who had had\ndifficulty finding employment in the past. We have also learned\nthat the tight labor market conditions were leading to creative\nsolutions between employers, on the one hand, and workforce\ndevelopment groups and educational institutions, on the other\nhand, to provide requisite training and skills to new\nemployees. As we saw in 2019, tight labor market conditions are\nimportant for delivering training and employment opportunities\nto disadvantaged communities and for achieving the Federal\nReserve's maximum employment goal.\nSince the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the reported\nunemployment rate has moved up to 13.3 percent and total\nemployment has fallen by about 20 million. The economic\nenvironment is completely different from what we were\nexperiencing during the original Fed Listens events. With that\nin mind, on May 21, we held our most recent Fed Listens to\nlearn how the new economic reality is affecting the public. For\nthis event, we focused on the disparity of the burden from this\ncrisis that households and businesses face, particularly in\nlow- and moderate-income communities. We heard from a wide\nrange of individuals who offered first-hand perspectives and\nways in which they are working to address the recent problems\nthrough workforce development; advocacy for workers, the\nelderly, and affordable housing; academia; community\ndevelopment financial institutions; small-businesses; and\nnonprofits.\nQ.2. Can you comment on whether prior extensions of\nunemployment insurance have made it easier for workers to\nbounce back from a recession? Could stabilizers, such as\nunemployment insurance, be more successful if they are\nautomatically triggered by a recession?\nA.2. As a general rule, however, I do not comment on specific\nfiscal policy or labor market policy proposals, as judgments\nabout those policies that are most appropriate for the United\nStates are best decided by Congress and the Administration.\nAccordingly, only Congress and the Administration can decide if\nmaking the Unemployment insurance (UI) system more\nautomatically responsive to economic downturns is appropriate.\nSpeaking broadly, though, increasing unemployment insurance\nbenefits in recessions is generally thought to provide a\nsignificant boost to economic activity per additional dollar\nspent. \\1\\ UI benefits are an important source of income for\nworkers who become involuntarily unemployed. Research has shown\nthat UI benefits buffer income and consumption losses for the\nfamilies of those laid off; some estimates show that each\nadditional dollar of unemployment insurance benefits boost\nconsumption of its recipients by roughly $0.30-0.60 on average.\n\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ See the Congressional Budget Office's ``Unemployment Insurance\nin the Wake of the Recent Recession'', November 2012 for a summary of\nthese estimates.\n\\2\\ See Chodorow-Reich, Gabriel, and John Coglianese. 2019.\n``Unemployment Insurance and Macroeconomic Stabilization'', Recession\nReady: Fiscal Policies to Stabilize the American Economy, edited by\nHeather Boushey, Ryan Nunn, and Jay Shambaugh, 153-179. Brookings\nInstitution.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs we have seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 36\nmillion Americans are seeking unemployment benefits. Under the\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, for\nexample, the Government expanded the scope of unemployment\ninsurance, increasing both the amount and duration of\nassistance. The amount and length of pay varies by State, but\nthe CARES Act added an additional 13 weeks to every State's\nmaximum pay period. The bill also created a new, temporary\nPandemic Unemployment Assistance program through the end of\nthis year to help individuals who lose work as a direct result\nof the public health emergency.\nQ.3. Taken together, how are global events--such as the\ncoronavirus outbreak, Boeing's production slowdown, and trade\ntensions--impacting U.S. supply chains and the economic\noutlook, especially from the perspective of the average\nAmerican household?\nA.3. Trade developments--including tariffs, countertariffs, and\nuncertainty about future trade policy--coincided with a\nsoftening in the U.S. manufacturing sector last year. While it\nis difficult to precisely determine the effects of these\nvarious forces on the economy, a number of studies have found\nevidence that these trade issues have restrained output and\nemployment in the U.S. manufacturing sector, mostly notably by\nraising the prices of the goods manufacturers import as inputs\nto their production process and also, to some extent, by\nlowering their exports. Historically, the manufacturing sector\nin the United States has been a source of economic strength and\nof good jobs for workers at all levels of education.\nIn addition to trade issues, part of the softness in\nmanufacturing is attributable to the slowing last year of the\nassembly pace of Boeing's 737 Max aircraft due to safety issues\nand, more recently, to the temporary cessation of the\nproduction of the aircraft. The production of civilian aircraft\nand of aircraft parts accounts for about 2\\1/2\\ percent of\ndomestic manufacturing, with supply chains that extend\nthroughout the entire country and that provide jobs for many\nthousands of Americans. While Boeing and their suppliers appear\nto have kept the great majority of the workers related to the\n737 Max on their payrolls during this period, continuing to do\nso could prove more difficult if the cessation of 737 Max\nproduction extended far into the future.\nAs for the coronavirus, the economic effects are still\ncoming into focus. Early on, as the coronavirus hit China hard,\nthe global supply chain was negatively affected, with China\nabruptly halting the production of materials and supplies used\nas inputs by U.S. factories. The coronavirus outbreak occurred\nduring the period when U.S. manufacturers typically stockpile\nChinese inputs, which at this time, blunted, or at least\ndelayed, the full effect of the Chinese shutdowns. In March,\nChinese factories restarted production, but they have been\nrunning somewhat below their full capacity even as U.S.\nproducers are running through their stocks of Chinese inputs;\nthe speed with which Chinese producers get back to full\ncapacity before U.S. stockpiles run down will determine the\ndegree to which shortages emerge or price spikes for critical\ninputs arise. Moreover, the cessation of Chinese exports also\nsnarled the intricate web of cargo vessels, which also has\naffected both importers and exporters in the United States. In\naddition, a drop in Chinese tourism affected U.S. tourist\ndestinations.\nThe coronavirus outbreak has evolved into a global health\ncrisis. While supply chain disruptions remain an issue, an\nenormous contraction in the U.S. economy has occurred that\nreflects a sharp pullback in spending by households as result\nof people engaging in both mandatory and voluntary ``social\ndistancing.'' For example, consumers have severely reduced\nspending on items consumed in public social settings, on\ntravel, or on items purchased in shopping malls or large\nshowrooms. Job losses in April that exceeded 20 million are a\nstark reflection of the economic contraction that is\nunprecedented in living memory.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF\nSENATOR MENENDEZ FROM JEROME H. POWELL\nQ.1. The FDIC will allow some of the banks it regulates the\nchoice of opting into the new OCC led Community Reinvestment\nAct (CRA) regulatory framework or continue to be examined under\nthe current system. One of reasons the OCC and FDIC decided to\nmove forward with their own CRA proposal was to clarify CRA\nstandards and reduce confusion. However, by creating a three-\ntiered system (the OCC and FDIC joint rule, the opt-in option,\nand a potential new Federal Reserve rule), the OCC and FDIC\nseem to be creating more confusion about the CRA and its\nimplementation. Are you concerned the OCC/FDIC rule, with the\nopt-in option, will increase confusion among banks and\ncommunities about how the CRA is implemented and what qualifies\nas a CRA activity?\nA.1. While the Federal Reserve Board (Board) did not join the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of\nthe Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in their Notice of\nProposed Rulemaking (NPR) revising elements of Community\nReinvestment Act (CRA) regulation, the Board shared detailed\nanalysis and proposals on CRA reform with our counterparts at\nthe OCC and FDIC in the preparation of the NPR, and the NPR\nreflected considerable input from the Board. We are reviewing\nthe comments that were submitted to the FDIC and OCC on the\nNPR, and expect to learn much--including important insights\nrelated to the aspects of the NPR that reflect our own input--\nfrom the review. As you may be aware, on May 20, the OCC\nseparately issued a final rule to modernize CRA regulations\nthat applies only to OCC-supervised banks. In light of this\ndevelopment, our ongoing analysis of CRA modernization issues,\nand our review of comments to the NPR, we are assessing a path\nforward.\nQ.2. Please describe what the aspects of the Fed's CRA proposal\nthe OCC and FDIC satisfactorily incorporated into their joint\nproposal.\nA.2. We support efforts to use clear metrics to guide CRA\nperformance assessments. Although the NPR put forth by the OCC\nand FDIC included a metrics approach that differed in a number\nof ways from the approach that Board staff discussed with the\nother agencies as part of our interagency discussions, the NPR\nincorporated an element of the retail metrics approach that\nBoard had raised with the other agencies. Specifically, the\nproposal included retail lending metrics for evaluating each\nassessment area based on: (1) the proportion of loan\noriginations that are made to low- and moderate-income (LMI)\nborrowers or small business customers; and (2) the proportion\nmade in LMI communities. These retail distribution metrics\nwould measure the number, rather than the dollar value, of\nloans that a bank has made.\nThe OCC's overall metrics approach in their final rule,\nissued on May 20, continues to differ in a number of ways from\nthe approach that Board staff discussed with the other agencies\nas part of CRA interagency discussions. Still, the final rule\nmaintains retail lending metrics similar to those discussed by\nBoard staff that are based on the distribution of a bank's\nloans to LMI borrowers and LMI communities in its assessment\nareas.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR TESTER\nFROM JEROME H. POWELL\nQ.1. Agriculture and Rural Lending--I asked your colleague Vice\nChairman Quarles, and Chairs McWilliams and Hood, about this\nwhen they were before this Committee in December. I have been\nhearing for the last year or more from community bankers in\nMontana that examiners seem more concerned lately when that\ntheir bank or credit union may be overly concentrated in ag.\nThis is a hard issue for rural communities--we don't want to\nfurther jeopardize these farmers who are already fighting to\nsurvive against Trump's trade disaster and difficult growing\nseasons, but we cannot let these challenges take community\nbanks down with them. Access to banks in these rural areas is\ncritical to communities, and we've already seen too many close.\nI'm focused on making sure that we support our farmers and\nranchers and their families through the current challenges\nfacing the agriculture sector, while continuing to prioritize\nthe safety and soundness of our community financial\ninstitutions.\nWhat are the risks to these banks as farmers are\nincreasingly overleveraged and continue to struggle with the\nrepercussions of these ongoing trade wars, extreme weather\nhappening more and more frequently because of our changing\nclimate, and persistently low commodity prices?\nDoes this pose a threat to rural America?\nWhat can and should we be doing in these communities?\nFrom a banking perspective, are you concerned about how\nthis will effect community banks across rural America?\nA.1. Agricultural producers and the banks that serve them are\nfacing many challenges due to weather and trade issues that are\nnow exacerbated by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The\nfinancial stress experienced by many farmers and ranchers due\nto these challenges, and stresses facing banks serving the\nagricultural sector, particularly community banks, continue to\nbe a priority for regulators.\nAgricultural conditions have remained weak for the past\nseveral years and financial stress in the sector has continued\nto increase at a gradual pace. Although agricultural loan\ndelinquencies have increased gradually in recent years,\nborrower stress has not yet led to a significant increase in\nthe volume of nonperforming loans. Asset quality and overall\nsafety and soundness at most agricultural banks were\nsatisfactory as of December 31, 2019. While most of the\ninstitutions currently remain in satisfactory condition, the\nimpact of COVID-19 on the safety and soundness of agricultural\nbanks has not fully materialized and is being monitored.\nAgricultural community banks have in-depth knowledge and\nexperience in their market area that allows them to make well-\ninformed credit decisions to meet the needs of their\ncommunities and manage risks that are associated with\nagricultural credit. We have seen agricultural lenders take a\nnumber of prudent steps to manage this increasing risk in light\nof persistently weak agricultural conditions. For example, as\nland values increased, these lenders reviewed their internal\npolicy limits around loan-to-value underwriting requirements.\nIn some instances, banks have required larger downpayments on\nnew farm real estate loans or set internal limits on the amount\nthey were willing to lend per acre, and relied more on\nhistorical values for underwriting when they observed local\nland values had skyrocketed. Additionally, some agricultural\nlenders are using credit enhancements such as loan guarantee\nprograms through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Farm\nService Agency to appropriately mitigate credit risk to the\nbank. Moreover, agricultural banks today, compared to those of\nthe 1980s, report stronger aggregate financial metrics,\nincluding more capital and reserves.\nThe Federal Reserve continues to monitor agricultural State\nmember banks to assess their risk management processes and to\nensure prudent steps are being taken during these periods of\nweakness. In 2011, the Federal Reserve issued guidance \\1\\ to\nthe industry on key risk factors in agricultural lending and\nsupervisory guidelines for a financial institution's risk\nmanagement practices. With consideration given to this\nguidance, examiners continue to encourage financial\ninstitutions to work constructively with borrowers, including\nagricultural borrowers, and consider prudent loan modifications\nconsistent with safe and sound lending practices to strengthen\nthe credit and mitigate credit risk.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ See SR letter 11-14 ``Supervisory Expectations for Risk\nManagement of Agriculture Credit Risk''.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMore recently, the Federal Reserve joined other regulatory\nagencies in issuing an interagency statement encouraging\nfinancial institutions to work constructively with borrowers\naffected by COVID-19 and providing additional information\nregarding loan modifications. The agencies encourage financial\ninstitutions to work with borrowers, will not criticize\ninstitutions for doing so in a safe and sound manner, and will\nnot direct supervised institutions to automatically categorize\nloan modifications as troubled debt restructurings.\nRecognizing the potential for further increases in\nfinancial stress among agricultural borrowers and banks, and\nthe direct ties to the broader communities in which they are\nlocated, the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor\nconditions as they evolve.

POWELL\nQ.1. Monetary Policy--In 2018, the Fed began a review of the\nstrategy, tools, and communications it uses to conduct monetary\npolicy. \\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, ``Review of\nMonetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications'', June 25, 2019,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-\npolicy-strategy-tools-and-communications.htm.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDescribe the implications of the apparent decline in the\nneutral rate of interest for future recessions and economic\ndownturns.\nDo you believe the Fed's current monetary policy tools will\nbe sufficient to alleviate an economic downturn?\nA.1. The Federal Reserve's response to COVID-19 pandemic has\nbeen guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and\nstable prices for the American people, along with our\nresponsibilities to promote the stability of the financial\nsystem. As I reported in recent testimony, in March we lowered\nour policy interest rate to near zero, and we expect to\nmaintain interest rates at this level until we are confident\nthat the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to\nachieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nIn addition to monetary policy, we took forceful measures\nin four areas: open market operations to restore market\nfunctioning; actions to improve liquidity conditions in short-\nterm funding markets; programs in coordination with the\nTreasury Department to facilitate more directly the flow of\ncredit to households, businesses, and State and local\ngovernments; and measures to allow and encourage banks to use\ntheir substantial capital and liquidity levels built up over\nthe past decade to support the economy during this difficult\ntime.\nTurning to your question regarding changes in the estimates\nof the neutral Federal funds rate, though there continue to be\na wide range of estimates, over the past two decades most\nestimates have declined significantly. A lower neutral rate\nimplies that the level of the Federal funds rate consistent\nwith the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment\nand price stability is lower than in the past and hence closer\nto its effective lower bound. As a result, there likely will be\nless room to reduce the Federal funds rate to support the\neconomy in economic downturns.\nHowever, the Federal Reserve has at its disposal other\ntools to provide economic stimulus, including forward guidance\nabout the likely course of monetary policy and balance sheet\npolicies (most notably large-scale asset purchases). Deployment\nof these other tools in response to the 2007-2008 financial\ncrisis put significant downward pressure on the longer-term\nborrowing rates of American families and businesses, thus\nsupporting the labor market recovery and pursuit of price\nstability.\nOverall, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) judges\nthat its existing toolkit has served the U.S. economy well over\nthe past decade. The experience acquired with the use of\nforward guidance and balance sheet policies has led to an\nimproved understanding of how these tools operate. Therefore,\nthe FOMC can proceed more confidently and preemptively than in\nthe past in using them when warranted by economic\ncircumstances. The Federal Reserve also has important liquidity\nprovision authority to improve confidence in the economy and\nrestore calm to financial markets, thus supporting achievement\nof its maximum employment and price stability goals. In\naddition to its usual liquidity-provision authority for\ndepository institutions, the Federal Reserve has, as you know,\nunder section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, the authority\nto provide broad-based liquidity to nondepository institutions\nin ``unusual and exigent circumstances.'' Restoring well-\nfunctioning financial markets through the prompt and broad-\nbased deployment of liquidity provisions was a central to the\nFederal Reserve's response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis\nand is also a cornerstone of our response to the economic\nchallenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThat said, the relatively low level of the neutral rate\nposes challenges for the conduct of monetary policy, and the\nFOMC is mindful of the risks posed by the effective lower bound\nin its policy deliberations. In part for this reason, the FOMC\nlaunched a review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and\ncommunication practices in November 2018 to ensure that it has\nthe right tools to fight recessions and that it deploys those\ntools promptly and effectively.\nThe Federal Reserve also has tools to support liquidity\nprovision and market functioning. For example, to support\nmarket functioning, recently we made use of the discount window\nmore attractive, deployed open market operations, and opened\nthree liquidity facilities \\2\\ with the approval of the\nSecretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury pursuant to\nour ``emergency and exigent'' authority under section 13(3) of\nthe Federal Reserve Act. Using our section 13(3) authority we\nalso established eight facilities \\3\\ to provide more direct\nsupport for the extension of credit across the economy. This\nauthority had been a cornerstone of our response to the\neconomic challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\2\\ The market functioning facilities include: the Commercial\nPaper Funding Facility, the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity\nFacility, and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility.\n\\3\\ These include (1) the Primary Market Corporate Credit\nFacility, (2) the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, (3) Term\nAsset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, the (4) Municipal Liquidity\nFacility, (5) the Main Street Lending Program which is comprised of the\nMain Street New Loan Facility, the Main Street Priority Loan Facility,\nand the Main Street Expanded Loan Facility, and (6) the Paycheck\nProtection Program Liquidity Facility.\nQ.2. What role do you believe fiscal policy will need to play\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nin the next downturn?\nA.2. The decline in the neutral rate of interest presents the\nFederal Reserve with a more challenging environment to achieve\nour dual mandate. Specifically, we face heightened risks of\nlengthy periods in which our policy interest rate is near zero.\nTo address this problem we are conducting a review of our\nmonetary policy strategies, tools, and communications. One\nvaluable tool for stabilizing the economy during a downturn is\nfiscal stimulus. Of course, that is not part of our toolkit, it\nis the responsibility of Congress and the Administration. We\nhave seen that fiscal stimulus has been helpful in restoring\ngrowth during many of the recessions over the past 50 years. It\nwas certainly helpful during the Great Recession when the\nFederal funds rate was near zero, and the fiscal measures taken\nthus far in response to the current crisis--the fastest and\nlargest response for any postwar downturn--have provided\nimportant support. While the overall policy response to date\nhas provided a measure of relief and stability, and will\nprovide some support to the recovery when it comes, COVID-19\nraises longer-term concerns as well. We know that deeper and\nlonger recessions can leave behind lasting damage to the\nproductive capacity of the economy through unnecessary\ninsolvencies on the part of households and businesses and long-\nterm unemployment. If it helps avoid long-term economic damage\nand leaves us with a stronger recovery, additional fiscal\nsupport though costly, could be worth it. This tradeoff is one\nfor elected representatives, who wield powers of taxation and\nspending.\nQ.3. President Trump has repeatedly advocated for negative\ninterest rates, arguing that they would boost economic growth.\n\\4\\ Do you agree? Describe the implications of negative\ninterest rates.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\4\\ NBC News, ``Trump Keeps Pushing `Negative' Interest Rates.\nWhat Would That Mean for Your Wallet?'' Ben Popken, September 23, 2019,\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/trump-keeps-pushing-negative-\ninterest-rates-what-would-mean-your-n1056546.\nA.3. The FOMC has discussed negative rates a number of times in\nthe past and has judged that the setting of negative rates is\nnot an attractive monetary policy tool in the United States.\nFor example, as part of our ongoing review of monetary policy\nstrategy, tools, and communications, the FOMC considered the\npossibility at our October 2019 meeting. As was noted in the\nminutes for the meeting, all FOMC participants judged that\nnegative rates ``currently did not appear to be an attractive\nmonetary policy tool in the United States.'' The FOMC sees\nforward guidance and balance sheet policies as preferable tools\nto provide additional policy stimulus when the policy rate is\nnear zero percent. In reaching this conclusion, policymakers\nhave noted that they see limited scope to bring the Federal\nfunds rate into negative territory and that the evidence on the\nbeneficial effects of negative interest rates abroad is mixed.\nMoreover, the implications of such a policy are difficult to\nanticipate, given that it is unclear what effect negative rates\nmight have on the willingness of financial intermediaries to\nlend and on the spending plans of households and businesses.\nFOMC participants have further noted that negative interest\nrates entail risks of introducing significant complexity or\ndistortions to the financial system. In particular, the U.S.\nfinancial system is considerably different from those in\neconomies that implemented negative interest rate policies, so\nthat negative rates could have more significant adverse effects\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\non market functioning and financial stability here than abroad.\nQ.4. Former Fed Chair Bernanke has argued that the decline in\nthe rate may be partly due to structural factors such as\ndemographic and technological change. \\5\\ Do you agree?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\5\\ The Brookings Institution, ``The New Tools of Monetary\nPolicy'', Ben Bernanke, January 4, 2020, https://www.brookings.edu/\nblog/ben-bernanke/2020/01/04/the-new-tools-of-monetary-policy/.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf so, is the Fed proactively thinking about the trends in\nthese structural factors and how they could impact the\neffectiveness of monetary policy in the future?\nA.4. The decline in the neutral rate likely reflects the\neffects of several domestic and global structural factors,\nincluding population aging, a step down in the pace of\nproductivity growth, and lower risk tolerance. Identifying\nstructural transformations and their effects on the neutral\nrate of interest in an economy constantly buffeted by shocks is\nan inherently challenging task. Accordingly, there remains\nsubstantial uncertainty about the neutral rate of interest and\nthe respective contributions of structural factors.\nIndependently of its origins, however, the decline in the\nneutral rate of interest poses challenges for the conduct of\nmonetary policy by calling for the use of tools other than\nlowering the target for the Federal funds rate to provide\nmonetary stimulus once the policy rate has been lowered near\nzero percent.\nThe Federal Reserve actively seeks to identify structural\nchanges and their implications for the conduct of monetary\npolicy. FOMC participants routinely discuss structural\ntransformations during their monetary policy deliberations,\ndrawing on extensive research and analysis conducted by Federal\nReserve staff, academics, private-sector analysts, and other\nsources. Federal Reserve officials frequently address\nstructural transformations in speeches, media interviews, and\nother public communications. The Federal Reserve's staff has\nreleased extensive research on structural transformations and\ntheir policy implications over time in working papers, policy\nnotes, academic publications and presentations, and other\npublic communications. Recently, the FOMC has discussed the\npolicy implications of key structural transformations as part\nof its review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and\ncommunication practices. \\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\6\\ For an example of policymakers' discussion of structural\ntransformations and their monetary policy implications, see the minutes\nof the July 2019 FOMC meeting.\nQ.5. In response to developments in overnight lending markets\nin September 2019, the Fed began conducting repo operations to\n``stabilize money markets and provide reserves to keep the\nFederal funds rate within its target range.'' \\7\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\7\\ Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, ``Monetary\nPolicy Report'', February 7, 2020, https://www.federalreserve.gov/\nmonetarypolicy/Files/20200207mprfullreport.pdf.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSome have pointed to the repo market concentration, with\nthe largest banks being almost exclusively responsible for\nengaging in transactions with the Fed and lending that money\nout. \\8\\ Can you describe the implications of the concentration\nlevels of the current repo market structure and how the\nconcentration of participants has impacted the Fed's recent\ninterventions?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\8\\ Wall Street Journal, ``Big Banks Loom Over Fed Repo Efforts'',\nDaniel Kruger, September 26, 2019, https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-\nbanks-loom-over-fed-repo-efforts-11569490202.\nA.5. In the last few months of 2019 and into early 2020, the\nFederal Reserve's reserve management purchases of Treasury\nbills and the Open Market Desk's repurchase agreement\noperations (repo) kept the aggregate quantity of reserve\nbalances above the level that prevailed in early September\n2019. These operations therefore ensured an ample supply of\nreserves to the banking system as a whole and so contributed to\nrelatively calm money market conditions during the end of the\n2019 and early 2020. Notably, these operations likely\ncontributed to stable conditions in short-term funding markets\nin the period immediately preceding the recent economic and\nfinancial turbulence. Thus, our repo operations have\ncontributed to the orderly functioning of U.S. financial\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nmarkets as a whole.\nQ.6. If the Fed were to adopt a standing repo facility, as it\nhas been considering even before the market disruption in\nSeptember, \\9\\ what factors would the Fed use to determine\nwhich counterparties would be eligible?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\9\\ Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, ``Minutes of\nthe Federal Open Market Committee'', June 18-19, 2019, https://\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes?0190619.htm.\nA.6. The minutes for the January 2020 FOMC meeting indicated\nthat several FOMC participants had suggested at that meeting\nthat the FOMC might resume before long its discussion of the\nlonger-run role played by repo operations in its ample-reserves\noperating framework, and that this new discussion should cover\nthe possible creation of a standing repo facility. However, the\nFOMC has not yet had such a further discussion, and no decision\nor extended FOMC deliberation has occurred regarding the\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\npossibility of a standing repo facility.\nQ.7. Financial Stability--In previous questions regarding the\nFed's response to climate change, you have claimed that the Fed\nuses ``its authorities and tools to prepare financial\ninstitutions for severe weather events.'' \\10\\ At the same\ntime, science has clearly demonstrated that extreme weather\nevents are becoming increasingly common as a result of climate\nchange. \\11\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\10\\ Letter from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H. Powell to\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, April 18, 2019.\n\\11\\ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ``Report:\nClimate Change Is Making Specific Weather Events More Extreme'',\nDecember 9, 2019, https://www.noaa.gov/news/report-climate-change-is-\nmaking-specific-weather-events-more-extreme.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTo the extent that these weather events continue becoming\nmore common and having a greater impact on the business cycle\nitself, do you believe that it would be appropriate for the Fed\nto more explicitly consider the risks associated with climate\nchange in its decision making?\nA.7. For the Federal Reserve's near-term analysis, we do take\ninto account information on the severity of weather events.\nWhen a severe weather event occurs, we closely monitor the\neffects on local economies, assess the implications for broader\nmeasures of economic production and employment, and adjust our\neconomic forecasts accordingly.\nFor example, our staff has relied on data from the Federal\nEmergency Management Agency and the Department of Energy to\ngauge the disruptions to oil and gas extraction, petroleum\nrefining, and petrochemical and plastic resin production in the\nwake of hurricanes that have affected the Gulf region. Our\nstaff regularly uses daily measures of temperatures and\nsnowfall from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\nweather stations to better understand how severe weather may be\naffecting measured and real economic activity in specific\nareas.\nOur understanding of how economic activities will be\naffected by a severe weather event depends critically on data\nproduced by the Federal statistical agencies, such as the\nCensus Bureau's County Business Patterns data, which provide\ninformation on economic activity across geographic locations.\nIn addition, our staff uses credit and debit card transactions\ndata for gauging how unusual or severe weather might be\naffecting consumer spending.\nAt present, we do not directly model how changes in\ntemperatures over long periods of time affect economic\nactivity. However, as the evidence of effects of climate change\non the dynamics of economic activity accumulates, this evidence\nwill influence our analysis and forecasts of macroeconomic\ndynamics and financial stability risks. And to the extent that\nclimate change affects the economic data on which our models\nare built--including the trends and the cyclical behavior of\ninvestment, consumption, production, and employment--climate\nchange will be incorporated in our analysis over time.\nQ.8. Do you believe it would be appropriate for the Fed to hire\neconomists that specialize in climate economics to address\nthese changes? Should the Fed hire natural scientists to inform\neconomic models? Do you have any plans to do so?\nA.8. Addressing climate change directly is an important issue\nthat Congress has entrusted to other agencies. A large body of\nnatural science research on the climate implications and risks\nfrom the rising level of greenhouse gases is already being\nproduced by the scientific community, which can be leveraged to\ninform economic research. Because of this, we do not expect to\nfocus our hiring on natural scientists.\nThe Federal Reserve, however, hires economists with\ndoctoral training in a broad array of economic and financial\ntopics, including staff with expertise in climate and\nenvironmental economics and related fields. Recent Federal\nReserve staff research includes, for example, the effects of\nclimate, weather, and disasters on economic and financial\noutcomes. Federal Reserve researchers and others are engaging\nin active work to better understand the specific interactions\nbetween climate-related risks, the real economy, financial\nstability, and the safety and soundness of financial\ninstitutions.\nIn addition, we are leading or participating actively in\ninternational efforts to understand these issues, including a\nnew project at the Financial Stability Board, and a new Basel\nCommittee Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Risks,\ncochaired by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Executive\nVice President for Supervision.\nFederal Reserve economists continue to produce research\nthat informs the dialogue on climate-related economic and\nfinancial risks.\nQ.9. Do you support the Fed officially joining the Network for\nGreening the Financial System (NGFS)? If not, why not?\nA.9. The Federal Reserve remains engaged with the Network for\nGreening the Financial System (NGFS) secretariat and its\nmembers, continues to participate in its meetings as a guest,\nand is following its work closely. We continue to discuss with\nthe NGFS what role the Board of Governors (Board) could\npotentially play in its work, in light of the scope of the\nBoard's activities and its statutory mandate, as well as the\nconstraints of the current NGFS charter.\nQ.10. The most recent report from Shared National Credit (SNC)\nReview program conducted jointly by the Fed, Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC), and Office of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (OCC), stated that ``credit risk associated with\nleveraged lending remains elevated'' and ``lenders have fewer\nprotections and risks have increased in leveraged loan terms\nthrough the current long period of economic expansion since the\nlast recession.'' \\12\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\12\\ Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency, ``Shared National Credit Program: 1st and 3rd Quarter 2019\nReviews'', https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/\nfiles/bcreg20200131a1.pdf.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease explain how the Fed monitors and evaluates the\ncredit-risk management practices of a financial institution to\nensure that these procedures, some of which are untested, will\nbe sufficient during an economic downturn.\nA.10. The Federal Reserve dedicates substantial resources to\nprovide oversight of leveraged loans in supervised institutions\nand closely supervises institutions with leveraged loan\nexposures through processes such as the Shared National Credit\n(SNC) review. In addition, Federal Reserve staff performs\nongoing analysis to assess and understand the risks within the\nbroader leveraged lending market.\nThe Federal Reserve expects its supervised banks to have\nprudent credit underwriting practices and commensurate risk\nmanagement processes, as well as appropriate controls,\ntransparency, and communication to senior management and the\nboard of directors about leveraged lending risks. Federal\nReserve supervisors evaluate banking organizations'\nunderwriting processes and risk management policies for\ncomprehensiveness and internal compliance, risk appetite, limit\nstructures, the independence of the risk management function\nfrom underwriting, the quality and reliability of internal\naudit function, timing and accuracy of internal and supervisory\nratings processes, and information reporting to senior\nmanagement and the board of directors. Deficient policies,\nprocedures, or practices that relate to safety and soundness\nmay result in supervisory actions. Our supervisory and\nregulatory policies are intended to ensure that the\ninstitutions we supervise can appropriately manage their risks\nthrough the credit cycle.\nQ.11. Do you believe that the Interagency Guidance on Leveraged\nLending \\13\\ issued in 2013 is sufficient to address the risks\nassociated with leveraged lending, particularly with respect to\nthe growth of nonbank lenders?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\13\\ Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, ``Interagency\nGuidance on Leveraged Lending'', March 21, 2013, https://\nwww.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1303a1.pdf.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDescribe how the Fed monitors compliance with that guidance\nand what actions are taken when a bank is found to have\ninadequate credit risk protections.\nA.11. The interagency guidance on leveraged lending promotes\nprudent underwriting and risk-management practices by banks and\nit helps supervisors fairly and consistently evaluate practices\nacross banks. Commercial banks remain the dominant originators\nof leveraged loans in the marketplace, though nonbank lenders\nhave taken a larger share of the riskiest parts of the market.\nWhile the leveraged lending guidance and existing supervisory\nactivity address risks associated with leveraged loans\noriginating from the banking sector, the guidance and\nsupervisory efforts do not apply to nonbank lenders or their\nactivities. To the extent that banks have exposures to the\nnonbank lenders in the leveraged loan market, for instance\nthrough investments in investment-grade tranches of\ncollateralized loan obligations or loans to nonbank financial\ninstitutions, those exposures are tested during the annual\nDodd-Frank Act stress tests and comprehensive capital analysis\nand review. And as noted above, the Federal Reserve expects its\nsupervised banks to have the appropriate risk-management\nprocesses and controls in place to address leveraged lending\nrisks.\nAs supervisory guidance, the 2013 guidance does not have\nthe force and effect of law, and the Federal Reserve does not\ntake enforcement actions based on supervisory guidance. If a\nbank has deficient practices relating to safety and soundness,\nthe Federal Reserve may take supervisory or enforcement actions\nbased on its underlying statutory authority, as appropriate, so\nthat the institution addresses those deficiencies. Examiners\nmay refer to the 2013 guidance to provide examples of safe and\nsound conduct related to leveraged lending activities.\nExaminers have not hesitated to issue supervisory findings\nrelated to leveraged lending activities in recent examinations\nwhen individual bank circumstances required them.\nQ.12. Increasingly, the riskiest leveraged lending is occurring\noutside the banking system.\nDo those loans currently pose a risk to financial\nstability? If not, please explain why and under what\ncircumstances the Fed would begin to judge them a threat to\nfinancial stability.\nMany of these nonbank lenders fall into a regulatory gap.\nWhat tools does the Federal Government have to mitigate the\nrisks from the growth of leveraged lending and the\ndeterioration of the terms of those loans?\nA.12. The Federal Reserve continues to monitor developments in\nthe leveraged lending market, and we have been attentive to the\nrisks of leveraged loans and corporate debt in general, noting\nthe issue in several speeches, testimony, the June 2020\nMonetary Policy Report, and in our Financial Stability Reports,\npublished twice a year. Highly leveraged companies may\nexperience greater strains during a downturn than those with\nless leverage, and we are closely monitoring the effects of\nthose strains on banks and other financial institutions. The\nmost recent Financial Stability Report did note an uptick in\ndefaults of leveraged loans along with a reduction in the\nissuance of new leveraged loans. \\14\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\14\\ Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Financial\nStability Report (May 2020), https://www.federalreserve.gov/\npublications/files/financial-stability-report-20200515.pdf.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Federal Reserve supervises the lending and risk-\nmanagement practices of banking organizations that are subject\nto its jurisdiction, such as State member banks and depository\ninstitution holding companies. Nonbank lenders that fall\noutside of the purview of the three prudential banking Federal\nregulators generally are not subject to the same level of\noversight or transaction testing as is typical of regulated\nbanking organizations. While the Federal Reserve does not\ndirectly supervise the lending and risk-management practices of\nthese nonbanks, we have some ability to indirectly monitor\nrisks from their leveraged lending activities. To the extent\nthat banks have exposures to the nonbank lenders in the\nleveraged loan market, those exposures are tested during the\nannual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests and Comprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review.\nQ.13. Private equity firms often finance acquisitions through\nhighly leveraged loans. According to the private equity\nindustry, firms acquired in these acquisitions now employ more\nthan 8 million workers. \\15\\ In an economic downturn, what\nwould you expect to happen to employment in these firms?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\15\\ Office of Senator Elizabeth Warren, Letter From Senator\nElizabeth Warren et al. to Carmine Di Sibio, Global Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Office of Ernst and Young AG, November 18, 2019, https://\nwww.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Letter%20to%20Ernst%20and%20\nYoung%20re%20PE%20report.pdf.\nA.13. We should be concerned about possibly excessive and broad\nbuild-ups of corporate debt and leverage, in any form, that\ncould potentially amplify a macroeconomic downturn. Private\nequity firms often acquire companies that are troubled or where\nthey believe costs could be reduced in order to improve the\nefficiency of the ongoing business. Often, these companies are\npurchased using debt at high-leverage multiples. Firms with\nhigher debt-service burdens, all else equal, have less\nfinancial flexibility and thus are likely to be faster to\nreduce spending and at least temporarily reduce employment in\nresponse to a decline in their sales. That said, the propensity\nto finance with debt tends to be higher for companies or in\nindustries that earn steadier cash flows and have more modest\nneeds for reinvestment or research and development.\nIt is difficult to know whether or how much private equity-\nowned firms might be more vulnerable that others, and the\nresearch on this topic finds mixed results. Although elevated\nleverage could be a source of vulnerability for some private\nequity-owned companies, private equity firms themselves may\noffer a funding backstop that could provide additional\nresilience for their companies.\nQ.14. Regulation--The OCC and FDIC made the decision to heed to\nthe concerns of the Fed with respect to their plan to modify\nthe Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and issued a new proposed\nrule on the Jaw jointly enforced by the three agencies without\nthe Fed last December. \\16\\ On January 8, 2020, Governor\nBrainard released her own alternative plan to modernize the\nCRA. \\17\\ You have since stated that while the entire Board has\nnot yet voted on the proposal, you supported the framework she\ndescribed.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\16\\ Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation, Federal Register Notice, ``Community Reinvestment Act\nRegulations'', January 9, 2020, https://www.federalregister.gov/\ndocuments/2020/01/09/2019-27940/community-reinvestment-act-regulations.\n\\17\\ Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\n``Strengthening the Community Reinvestment Act by Staying True to Its\nCore Purpose'', Governor Lael Brainard, January 8, 2020, https://\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20200108a.htm.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease describe in detail the aspects of the FDIC and OCC\nplan that prevented the Fed from joining the proposal.\nDoes the Fed commit to not joining a final rule that does\nnot address these issues?\nA.14. Implementing and strengthening the Community Reinvestment\nAct (CRA) regulations is a key priority for the Federal\nReserve. We have taken a close look at different approaches to\nstrengthen the CRA rules in ways that further the core purposes\nof the statute, and this work will be an ongoing priority for\nus.\nThere is a fair amount of agreement on the part of the\nagencies on some of the overall objectives of CRA modernization\nand some of the challenges of the current regulatory approach\nthat we are all trying to address. For example, all of the\nagencies share an interest in using metrics to inform\nperformance assessments with the objective of increasing the\nlevel of transparency and consistency in CRA examinations.\nThere is also broad agreement on the need to update CRA\nregulations to reflect new ways of obtaining financial\nservices, including via online channels. Finally, there is\nagreement on the need to provide more clarity on what counts\nfor CRA consideration.\nOn May 20, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n(OCC) separately issued a final CRA rule that applies to only\nOCC-supervised banks. In light of this development, our ongoing\nanalysis of CRA modernization issues, and our review of\ncomments to the OCC and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's\n(FDIC) notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR), we are assessing a\npath forward.\nTo date, my colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve have\nfocused on evaluating retail lending and community development\nactivities separately. Having separate retail lending and\ncommunity development tests would allow regulators to set\nmetrics based on opportunities available in a given market,\nwhich can differ for retail lending and community development\nfinancing activities. Further, having separate tests also would\nallow regulators to do full reviews of how banks use branches,\nmobile banking, and volunteer activities to meet the needs of\ntheir communities. We also have focused on developing a\ntailored approach in applying metrics that would enable\nadjusting those metrics to local conditions and including\nmetrics that adjust across business cycles. Additionally, we\nsupport grounding reforms in data and analysis and relying as\nmuch as possible on information already reported by banks.\nFinally, while there is agreement on the need for greater\nclarity in terms of what counts for CRA credit, we need a high\nlevel of confidence that expanding eligible activities\nmaintains the regulations' focus on low- and moderate-income\nplaces and households.\nQ.15. Much of the criticism of the other agencies' plan focuses\non the lack of analysis demonstrating the economic impact of\nthe changes. However, according to Governor Brainard, the Fed\nhas conducted some analysis with relevant data and would like\nto publish that data so the public can provide feedback.\nWhen does the Fed anticipate doing so?\nDo you believe it is important for any new metrics included\nin a new CRA plan are grounded in data?\nDo you believe that it is important for the public to have\nample time to examine these data to provide input and ensure\nthat reforming this critical civil rights law is done\ncorrectly?\nA.15. As Governor Brainard discussed in January, the Federal\nReserve constructed a database to assist our efforts in\nanalyzing possible revisions to CRA, including the possible use\nof metrics. This database draws upon publicly available data,\nincluding data that are currently found in public CRA\nevaluations for individual banks. We believe that this is a\nvaluable resource that can help give us the confidence we need\nto develop metrics and thresholds that can be used in\nevaluating CRA performance. The database also helps provide\ninsight in how a proposed metrics approach would affect small\nbanks and banks in different types of geographies. We shared\nthe data tables with the public in early March 2020.\nQ.16. You said during the hearing that the Fed was mostly\nfocused on coming to consensus with the OCC and the FDIC before\nthe proposal was issued, but hasn't formally engaged since that\ntime. What is the Fed's plan going forward? Will the Fed\nformally vote on the proposal to be published in the Federal\nRegister and subject to the traditional notice and comment\nperiod?\nA.16. As noted above, on May 20, the OCC separately issued a\nfinal CRA rule that applies to only OCC-supervised banks. Given\nthis, our ongoing analysis of CRA modernization issues, and our\nreview of comments to the NPR, we are assessing a path forward.\nWe remain interested in working with the other agencies on an\nongoing basis, as we have demonstrated in our actions on CRA\nduring the current crisis. For example, we recently issued a\njoint statement on assessing CRA-eligible activities that are\nresponsive to the banking needs of low- and moderate-income\nhouseholds and areas as a result of actions taken in response\nto containing the coronavirus. If the Board does opt to release\na proposal to be published in the Federal Register, we would\nplan to formally vote on it and it would be subject to a notice\nand comment period.\nQ.17. What are the consequences of having two separate CRA\nregimes for institutions with different regulators?\nA.17. We are currently assessing the OCC's final CRA rule that\napplies to only OCC-supervised banks, issued on May 20. As our\nreview is ongoing, it would be premature to assess the\nconsequences of having separate CRA regimes for institutions\nwith different regulators.\nQ.18. On January 30, 2020, the Fed finalized a rule to\ndetermine ``when a company controls a bank or a bank controls a\ncompany.'' \\18\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\18\\ Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, ``Federal\nReserve Finalizes Rule To Simplify and Increase the Transparency of the\nBoard's Rules for Determining Control of a Banking Organization'',\nJanuary 30, 2020, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/\npressreleases/bcreg20200130a.htm.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReporting has indicated that the rule could allow private\nequity funds to control a greater portion of a bank's equity\nand thereby allow private equity investors to influence the\noperations of banks. \\19\\ Given the various risks associated\nwith the private equity business model and documented research\nthat demonstrates that private equity investments in financial\ncompanies can increase the risk profile of those companies,\n\\20\\ do you believe that this rule increases the level of risk\nin the financial sector?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\19\\ New York Times, ``The Fed Wants To Loosen Rules Around Big\nBanks and Venture Capital'', Jeanna Smialek and Emily Flitter, January\n30, 2020, https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/business/economy/volcker-\nrule-banks-venture-capital.html.\n\\20\\ Harvard University, ``Private Equity Ownership, Risk-Taking,\nand Performance in the Life and Annuities Industry'', Divya Kirti and\nNatasha R.

The final rule is intended to simplify and proved\ntransparency to the Board's control standards by codifying a\ncomprehensive control framework in regulation. The final rule\nis generally consistent with current practice, with certain\ntargeted adjustments, and therefore is not expected to\nmaterially change the level of risk in the financial sector.

If so, please describe how the Fed will monitor these\nownership structures and how the Fed will determine if there is\na financial stability risk associated with a banking\norganization's ownership structure?\nA.20. The Board will continue to monitor the ownership of\nbanking organizations as part of its normal supervisory\nprocess. The Board also will continue monitoring for financial\nstability risks through its broad program to assess the\nstability and resilience of the U.S. financial system. In\naddition, the Board must consider financial stability in\nconnection with many merger and acquisition applications under\nthe Bank Holding Company Act and the Home Owners' Loan Act, as\nrevised by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act.\nQ.21.

The firm's remediation plans under the Federal Reserve\nConsent Order, and information on the progress of the firm, are\nconfidential supervisory information. However, the Federal\nReserve does not have a timeline for lifting the asset cap and\ndoes not intend to lift the asset cap until the firm has fully\nresolved its problems and adopted and implemented, to our\nsatisfaction, measures that address the risk management\nbreakdowns that led to the Federal Reserve's enforcement\naction.\nOn a temporary and narrow basis, due to the extraordinary\ndisruptions from the coronavirus, the Federal Reserve on April\n8, 2020, modified the growth restriction on Wells Fargo so that\nit can provide additional support to small businesses. The\nchange will only allow the firm to make additional small\nbusiness loans as part of the Paycheck Protection Program and\nthe Federal Reserve's Main Street Lending Program. The changes\ndo not otherwise modify the Board's February 2018 enforcement\naction against Wells Fargo.\nAs you are aware, the Board will vote on any decision to\nterminate the asset growth restriction imposed by the Order,\nand that decision will be released to the public.\nQ.22.

As I expressed in response to your letter of February 11,\n2020, the Federal Reserve is committed to continually reviewing\nits supervisory processes and practices in order to increase\ntheir effectiveness and enhance transparency, while maintaining\na supervisory framework that promotes a safe, sound, and stable\nfinancial system. Fundamental to this work is our belief that\neffective supervision requires clear two-way communications and\ntransparent supervisory expectations. We are working to ensure\nthat our framework for supervisory communications focuses\nsupervised institutions on the most important safety and\nsoundness and compliance concerns identified by examiners.\nThe Federal Reserve takes very seriously its role in\nsupervising financial institutions under its jurisdiction.\nStrong supervisory processes and practices, including rigorous\nexamination activities, are vital to that role. Critical\ncomponents of strong supervision include evaluating banking\norganizations' activities and practices and, as warranted,\nissuing findings that require supervised institutions to take\ncorrective action in a timely manner. This aspect of\nsupervision promotes the adoption and maintenance of sound\npractices and helps to avert excessive risk taking. Early\nidentification of supervisory concerns also helps to deter\nactions or activities that may otherwise significantly impair\ninstitutions' safety and soundness.\nOur overarching goal is to ensure that any changes to\nsupervisory processes and practices are properly calibrated and\nwould help us better fulfill our statutory responsibility to\npromote a safe, sound, and stable banking system.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SCHATZ\nFROM JEROME H. POWELL\nQ.1. According to the Federal Reserve's annual supervisory\nreport for 2019, approximately 40-45 percent of financial\nholding companies (FHCs) with more than $100 billion in assets\nhave a less than satisfactory rating, and thus are not meeting\nthe Bank Holding Company Act standard of ``well-managed.'' This\nis a trend that has spanned more than the last 10 years. While\nwe cannot know from aggregated supervisory data whether which\nfirms are falling below the statutory standard year after year,\nit is a troubling trend. It suggests both a widespread failure\nof large FHCs to manage themselves well, as well as a\npersistent failure to correct their deficiencies. In addition,\nmore than half of the Federal Reserve's supervisory findings\nhave related to deficiencies in the governance and risk\nmanagement of these large banks.\nWells Fargo is one of the most recent and high-profile\nexamples of poor management. Wells Fargo has been responsible\nfor a string of egregious consumer abuses in several business\nunits, including (a) opening over 3.5 million fake accounts;\n(b) illegally repossessing military members' cars; (c) charging\nauto loan borrowers for insurance without their knowledge; (d)\nimproperly levying fees for extending mortgage rate-locks; (e)\nfailing to offer mortgage modifications because of a software\nglitch that resulted in several hundred foreclosures; and (f)\ncharging wealth management services for inappropriate add-on\nproducts and steering them into investments that generated\nlarger commissions for Wells. According to a report\ncommissioned by Wells' independent directors, the firm's\nsprawling organizational structure inhibited effective risk\nmanagement.\nThe Fed has responded by imposing an unprecedented asset\ncap until the company fixes its governance problems. But the\nFed has the authority to require Wells Fargo, and other poorly\nmanaged FHCs, to make themselves smaller and less complex in\norder to regain control over their management.\nDo you see any benefits to institutions like Wells Fargo\nbeing smaller and less complex?\nA.1. Since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has\nsubjected larger, more complex firms to more stringent\nregulatory requirements (such as the G-SIB surcharge, which\nincreases with size and complexity) and comprehensive, intense\nexamination focused on key risks. The Federal Reserve will\ncontinue to appropriately tailor its regulatory and supervisory\nregime to calibrate stringency and severity to the risks a firm\nposes to the financial system.\nQ.2. What is the Fed doing to improve governance at large,\npoorly managed firms?\nA.2. Since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has taken\na number of regulatory and supervisory steps to improve\ngovernance at large firms in general and firms that are not\nwell managed in particular. These steps built on the existing\nregulatory and supervisory framework that has for many years\nrestricted firms that are not well managed.\nFor example, large firms are subject to specific governance\nrequirements in Regulation YY (12 CFR part 252). In addition,\nthe Federal Reserve has articulated governance expectations for\nlarge firms in Supervision and Regulation (SR) Letter 12-17\n(Consolidated Supervision Framework for Large Financial\nInstitutions), and that governance is a fundamental aspect of\neach of the three component ratings assigned to large firms\n(see SR 19-3, Large Financial Institution (LFI) Rating System).\nThe supervisory programs for large financial institutions,\nwhich culminate in ratings assigned under the LFI rating system\neach year, include examinations and other activities that focus\non governance. If governance issues are identified, supervisors\ndirect the board and senior management to address them through\nsupervisory findings and formal and informal enforcement\nactions, as appropriate. If a firm fails to address these\nissues, such actions may be escalated and lead to more\nstringent limitations on their operations, as in the case of\nWells Fargo.\nQ.3. Has the Fed considered exercising its divestment authority\nunder Section 4(m) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to\nrequire large FHCs that are poorly managed to shrink themselves\nuntil they are better able to manage themselves?\nA.3. When a financial holding company (FHC) falls out of\ncompliance with section 4(l) of the Bank Holding Company Act,\nby becoming less than well-managed or well-capitalized, the\nnoncompliant FHC enters into a confidential 4(m) agreement with\nthe Federal Reserve Board (Board) requiring, among other\nthings, that they remedy the identified deficiencies. This\nagreement is an enforcement action that permits the FHC to\ncontinue operating while it addresses its deficiencies. The\nagreement is approved by the Board and may be modified or\nterminated by the Board.\nThrough the 4(m) agreement, the FHC is required to seek\nprior approval from the Board to engage in any new financial\nactivities or to make nonbank investments or acquisitions. \\1\\\nThe Board may also impose other restrictions on the FHC as\nappropriate. This approach incentivizes the firm to focus on\nfixing its supervisory issues.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ 12 CFR 225.83(d).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf a noncompliant FHC fails to address the identified\ndeficiencies within the specified period of time then the Board\nmay require the institution to divest its depository\ninstitutions unless the FHC chooses to voluntarily cease all of\nits FHC-only permissible activities. The Board regularly\nassesses a noncompliant FHC's progress in remediation of\nidentified issues and as part of this review considers whether\nit would be appropriate to implement other limitations or\nultimately exercise authority to require divestiture.\nQ.4. Why has the Fed never used this authority before?\nA.4. We have found that the broad range of supervisory and\nenforcement tools that Congress as conferred on the Board have\ngenerally been effective in motivating institutions to\nremediate issues. These tools include the ability to issue\nexamination findings that highlight Matters Requiring Attention\nand Matters Requiring Immediate Attention, as well as ratings\ndowngrades. If a problem requires a more detailed resolution or\nis more pervasive at an institution, the Board can impose\ninformal enforcement actions (typically in the form of\nMemorandums of Understanding) and formal enforcement actions,\nsuch as Written Agreements and Cease and Desist Orders, which\nmay carry civil money penalties, are available tools. In\naddition, there is a range of restrictions the Federal Reserve\nmay impose through 4(m) agreements short of requiring\ndivestiture, such as limits on particular nonbank businesses.\nEnforcement measures may escalate depending on the severity\nor difficulty of the problem. Indeed, the decision to force\ndivestiture of a depository institution or cessation of nonbank\nfinancial activities would be one of the most severe penalties\nthat would be considered if the informal and formal enforcement\ntools exercised throughout the supervisory process did not\nresult in corrective action, or if circumstances otherwise\nwarrant a heightened response.\nQ.5. Under what circumstances would the Fed use this authority\ngoing forward?\nA.5. As discussed above, because of the severity of the action\nand the potential for unintended consequences, the Board would\nconsider ordering divestiture only in severe cases where other\noptions would not be feasible or effective. The risk of\nunintended adverse consequences to the broader economy would be\na primary consideration, as would the severity and duration of\nthe issues giving rise to the consideration.\nThe supervisory process is focused on addressing the issues\nyou have identified, including ensuring that large and complex\norganizations have robust risk management practices to ensure\nsafety and soundness and compliance with consumer compliance\nlaws and regulations. I welcome further discussion on ways to\nimprove our current approach to this important issue.\nQ.6. While unemployment has reached record lows, those numbers\ncan obscure the economic reality of working Americans. For\nexample, in Hawaii, 48 percent of households have incomes that\nare not high enough to afford a basic household budget that\nincludes housing, childcare, food, transportation, and health\ncare. \\2\\ Almost a quarter of working adults in Hawaii report\nthat they work multiple jobs to make ends meet. \\3\\ For these\nhouseholds in Hawaii and in communities across the country, the\nunemployment rate may be low, but they are not enjoying the\nfinancial security that should come from working full-time.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\2\\ https://www.auw.org/sites/default/files/ALICEoverview.pdf\n\\3\\ https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2020/01/31/survey-hawaii-adults-\nsay-theyre-struggling-financially/\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs the Federal Reserve works to fulfill its dual mandate,\ndoes it consider data that provide insight into the quality of\nthe jobs available or whether employment is providing wages\nthat can support a basic household budget?\nIf yes, what data are the Fed using and how is it using\nthem?\nIf no, why not?\nA.6. In fulfilling our dual mandate, the Federal Reserve Board\nlooks at a broad range of labor market indicators, including\nthose on the types of jobs workers have and how workers from\ndifferent income and demographic groups are faring. We do not\ntarget a particular level of wages for the aggregate economy or\nfor particular demographic groups. Instead, we use labor market\nindicators to assess whether resources in the economy are being\nused to the fullest extent possible without creating undue\ninflationary pressures. For example, in the recovery from the\nGreat Recession, we focused attention on the number of\nindividuals that were working part-time for economic reasons.\nThese workers are included in the Bureau of Labor Statistics'\n(BLS) U-6 measure of unemployment. The number of these workers\nremained elevated for longer than the conventional unemployment\nrate, termed U-3 by the BLS, following the Great Recession, and\nsuggested at that time that the unemployment rate alone was\nunderstating the number of workers who would work more if the\ndemand for labor increased.\nMore recently, but prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, we\nfocused intently on whether disadvantaged or struggling\nsegments of society were benefiting from the overall\nimprovement in the labor market. Fed Listens--a series of\nevents aimed at consulting with a broad range of stakeholders\nin the U.S. economy--was particularly valuable for us in this\nrespect. We heard that many individuals and communities were\nonly beginning to feel the positive effects of economic\nexpansion, which suggested that output and employment were not\nas high as they potentially could be, at least in these\ncommunities. We were encouraged that wages for workers with the\nlowest incomes were rising the most and that many disadvantaged\nindividuals were starting to benefit from the long expansion.\nSince the COVID-19 outbreak, we have been concerned that\nworkers earning the least have suffered the most from the\nunprecedented decline in economic activity. Because these\nworkers often lack the financial resources to sustain\nthemselves for long without work, the potential damage to the\neconomy and to economic well-being from prolonged unemployment\nis substantial. As the current situation evolves, we are\nprepared to use our full range of tools to support the economy,\nmaintain the flow of credit to households and businesses, and\npromote our maximum employment and price stability goals.\nQ.7. During the hearing, you stated that in a future recession,\nthe Federal Reserve would use tools that it used for the first\ntime during the 2008 financial crisis, including quantitative\neasing through purchases of long-term assets and Treasury\nbills. Quantitative easing was successful in increasing the\nmoney supply and pushing down interest rates. But even with\nalmost $2.6 trillion in quantitative easing, one quarter of\nAmerican families lost at least 75 percent of their wealth and\nmore than half lost at least 25 percent of their wealth. \\4\\\nAnd the pace of economic recovery was historically slow,\naveraging just 2 percent instead of the average of 3-5 percent\ntypical of other economic recoveries.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\4\\ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4200506/\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe problem for households who lost their homes and for the\nbroader economy was that not enough of the money that the Fed\npumped into the financial system made it into the hands of\nAmerican households and businesses. In stead, much of the extra\nsupply of money remained within the financial system and was\npoured back into the stock market. Two years after the start of\nthe financial crisis, the Fed cleared the largest banks to pay\nout dividends and buy back shares. Since then, stock buybacks\nin the financial sector--and economywide--have surged. In the\npast 10 years, the financial sector spent $860 billion in stock\nbuybacks, and in 2019, S&P 500 companies spent a record $1\ntrillion in stock buybacks. These data suggests that the Fed's\nreliance on using the financial system as its intermediary for\nstimulating the economy in a crisis was inefficient.\nDo you think the financial system made the best use of the\nadditional money supply from quantitative easing?\nA.7. The Federal Reserve's asset purchase programs were mainly\nintended to place downward pressure on longer-term interest\nrates to reduce the cost of funding to business and households.\nAcademic research suggests that the purchases programs were\nsuccessful in achieving this goal. \\5\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\5\\ See Gagnon, Joseph E. 2016. ``Quantitative Easing: An\nUnderappreciated Success'', Policy Briefs PB16-4, Peterson Institute\nfor International Economics; and Kuttner, Kenneth N. 2018. ``Outside\nthe Box: Unconventional Monetary Policy in the Great Recession and\nBeyond'', Journal of Economic Perspectives, 32 (4): 121-46.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn addition to reducing the cost of funding, the Federal\nReserve's asset purchase programs also appeared to have boosted\nthe availability of funding to business and households through\nincreased bank lending-though these effects are difficult to\nestimate precisely, as banks raise funds from various sources\nand those funds are all fungible. Nonetheless, recent academic\nresearch provides evidence that the asset purchase programs did\nincrease bank's risk tolerance and their lending to customers.\nFor example, several studies find that following the first\nround of large-scale asset purchases (LSAP) and the third round\nof LSAPs, which involved Federal Reserve purchases of agency\nmortgage-backed securities (MBS), banks with higher initial\nholdings of MBS increased lending more than banks with little\ninitial MBS exposure, and were more likely to reorient their\nlending activities towards riskier loans and easier lending\nstandards. \\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\6\\ See Rodnyansky, Alexander, and Olivier M. Darmouni (2017).\n``The Effects of Quantitative Easing on Bank Lending Behavior'', Review\nof Financial Studies, vol. 30, pp. 3858-3887; Chakraborty, Indraneel,\nand Goldstein, Itay, and MacKinlay, Andrew, 2020.

Evidence From the Federal Reserve's LSAPs'', Journal of\nBanking and Finance.\nQ.8. In the case of a future recession, do you think the\neconomy would benefit more if the Fed used its tools to\nincrease the money supply in a way that put money directly into\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nthe hands of American households?\nA.8. The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range\nof tools to support the economy, thereby promoting its maximum\nemployment and price stability goals. For example, in the\ncurrent economic downturn, the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) has moved quickly to cut the policy rate to near zero\nand stated that it intends to keep the rates at that level\nuntil it is confident that the economy has weathered recent\nevents and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and\nprice stability goals.\nTo support the flow of credit to households and businesses,\nfoster smooth market functioning, and promote effective\ntransmission of monetary policy to broader financial\nconditions, the Federal Reserve has been purchasing large\namounts of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities.\nFederal Reserve policies to lower short- and longer-term\ninterest rates are helping-by reducing the interest payments\nthat households pay on their mortgages and other loans-to put\nmore money in the hands of American households. Additionally,\nby providing support for economic activity and jobs in this\nchallenging time, our actions will also help to put more\nmoney--in the form of labor income--into the hands of American\nhouseholds.\nThe Federal Reserve is also undertaking programs to provide\nstability to the financial system and to more directly support\nthe flow of credit in the economy--for households, for\nbusinesses of all sizes, and for State and local governments.\nMany of these programs rely on emergency lending powers that\nare available only in very unusual circumstances. The Federal\nReserve is deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented\nextent, enabled in large part by the financial backing and\nsupport from Congress and the Treasury. However, these are\nlending powers, and not spending powers. The Federal Reserve\ncannot grant money to particular beneficiaries, but can only\nmake loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the\nloans will be repaid.\nQ.9. If American households had been able to keep up with their\nrent and mortgage payments, pay their bills, and maintain\nfinancial stability during the recession, do you think it would\nhave enabled the U.S. economy to recover faster from the\ncrisis? What do you think the impact would have been on\nhousehold wealth today?\nA.9. During and after the 2007-2008 financial crisis and the\nGreat Recession the Board and the FOMC indeed exercised their\nstatutory authority to undertake a wide range of aggressive and\nunprecedented conventional and unconventional policy actions,\nincluding large-scale asset purchases. Although those actions\ndid mitigate to a considerable extent the consequences of\nseverely adverse and widespread pressures and difficulties\nfacing families and businesses all across the country, very\nmany American families fell behind on their rent payments or\nmortgage payments, and fell into a fragile financial state.\nMoreover, there were other Government programs, such as the\nHome Affordable Refinance Program, that allowed mortgagors to\neither lower their monthly mortgage payments or to pay down\ntheir loan faster by lowering their interest rates, and allowed\nthem to build more equity. Such programs were more effective\nbecause the Federal Reserve purchases of mortgage-backed\nsecurities helped improve conditions in the secondary market\nfor mortgages.\nHad families been able to maintain their incomes, home\nvalues, and other financial resources throughout that extremely\ndifficult period, household wealth would likely have been\nhigher than its record level at the end of 2019, but one cannot\nknow just how much.\nQ.10. What tools could the Fed use to make sure that any\nincrease in the money supply in a crisis gets into the hands of\nAmerican households, rather than remaining in the hands of\nbanks or shareholders?\nA.10. As mentioned above, Federal Reserve policies to lower\nshort- and longer-term interest rates--by reducing the interest\npayments that households pay on their mortgages and other\nloans--help to put more money in the hands of American\nhouseholds in a crisis. Additionally, by providing support for\neconomic activity and jobs in this challenging time, lower\ninterest rates will also put more money--in the form of labor\nincome--into the hands of American households.\nDuring the 2007-2008 financial crisis and more recently in\nresponse to the COVID-19 crisis, the Federal Reserve purchased\nagency MBS in order to support the transmission of changes in\npolicy rates to mortgage rates, which are the key interest\nrates that households face when they buy a house or refinance\nan existing mortgage. Additionally, in both of these crisis\nepisodes the Federal Reserve established the Term Asset-Backed\nSecurity (ABS) Loan Facility (TALF) to support the flow of\ncredit--in the form of auto loans, credit card loans, student\nloans, and other loans--to households. The Federal Reserve took\nthese actions to alleviate significant dislocations in agency\nMBS and in private label ABS markets that were impeding the\nflow of credit to households.\nQ.11. Can you provide an update on what the Fed is doing to\naddress the financial risks from climate change in its\nsupervisory and financial stability responsibilities? Please be\nspecific about the steps you are taking. What does the Fed hope\nto accomplish in the next year?\nA.11. The Federal Reserve is focused in the near term on\nmitigating economic disruptions and supporting the efficient\nfunctioning of the financial system during recovery from the\nCOVID-19. However, we expect to continue a number of longer-\nterm supervisory and financial stability projects in the year\nahead, including on climate-related risks. We continue to\nparticipate actively in analytic efforts by the Basel\nCommittee, the International Association of Insurance\nSupervisors, and the Financial Stability Board, focused on\nassessing the impact of climate-related risks on the financial\nsystem. Federal Reserve researchers are continuing preexisting\nefforts to procure additional climate-related data and to\npursue projects on the intersection of climate-related risks\nwith supervisory policy. We also continue to engage externally\nand to identify and draw on expertise from other fields\nrelevant to the assessment of climate-related risks. To the\nextent the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS)\ncontinues to hold meetings during the ongoing public health\ncrisis, we also anticipate participating in those as a guest.\nQ.12. Does the Fed have the data it needs to assess climate\nfinancial risks?\nA.12. For the Federal Reserve's near-term analysis of economic\nand financial activity, the staff use a variety of data sources\nto measure the economic effects of weather events. These\ninclude, for example, data from the Federal Emergency\nManagement Agency and the Department of Energy used to gauge\nthe disruptions to oil and gas extraction, petroleum refining,\nand petrochemical and plastic resin production in the wake of\nhurricanes that have affected the Gulf region. Our staff\nregularly uses daily measures of temperatures and snowfall from\nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather\nstations to better understand how severe weather may be\naffecting measured and real economic activity in specific\nareas.\nOur understanding of what economic activities will be\naffected by a severe weather event depends critically on data\nproduced by the Federal statistical agencies, such as the\nCensus Bureau's County Business Patterns data, as those data\nprovide information on economic activity in different\ngeographic locations. In addition, our staff uses credit and\ndebit card transactions data for gauging how specific types of\nsevere weather might be affecting consumer spending in areas\naffected by those events.\nData remains a significant challenge in identifying,\nassessing, and managing climate-related financial risks, for\nthe Federal Reserve and for other organizations, such as\nfinancial institutions. In addition to data on economic\nactivity described above, understanding financial risks from\nclimate change requires different types of data, including\nclimatic, geospatial, and financial data. The challenges in\nmeeting these data needs are faced by central banks and\nsupervisors around the world, as well as by private financial\ninstitutions, researchers, and the public. The Federal Reserve\nis engaged in efforts to help bridge these gaps through\ninvestigating public and private data sources and through its\nwork with international groups such as the Basel Committee on\nBanking Supervision.\nQ.13. Could you provide an update on the Fed's work to join the\nNGFS? Is there an estimated timeline for when the Fed would\njoin, if it is going to? If the Fed joins as an observer, what\nwould that mean?\nA.13. While the timeline of the NGFS's activities is in flux as\na result of COVID-19, the Federal Reserve remains engaged with\nthe NGFS secretariat and its members, continues to participate\nin its meetings, and is following its work closely. We continue\nto explore how the Federal Reserve will be allowed by the NGFS\nto participate further in a way that is consistent the full\nrange of the Federal Reserve's responsibilities.\nQ.14. Do you see value in conducting scenario analyses or\nstress tests, either of individual institutions or the\nfinancial system as a whole, to gauge resilience to climate\nfinancial risk?\nA.14. The innovative and exploratory work of central banks on\n``climate stress-testing'' is valuable, precisely because of\nthe novel challenges that such an exercise poses. While\nscientific research on climate change is well developed,\nresearch on the specific transmission channels between climate\nchange and financial risk is novel and emerging in ways that\nspecifically affect many elements of traditional supervisory\nstress tests.\nAs climate-related risks manifest themselves over long\nhorizons, stress testing for those risks involves the challenge\nof formulating scenarios and projecting outcomes over periods\nthat stretch well beyond the current stress tests. Most\nsupervisory stress tests today project losses with granularity\nat horizons of 3 to 5 years. A granular analysis of the effects\nof climate on banks over a timeframe relevant for climate\nchange would require predictions of output, employment, and the\nstructure of the economy and financial system over a 60-year\nperiod. The uncertainty of such long-horizon economic forecasts\nwould dramatically reduce the plausibility and relevance of the\nresults.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF\nSENATOR CORTEZ MASTO FROM JEROME H. POWELL\nQ.1. In your testimony before the Banking Committee, we\ndiscussed the percentage of people who are currently working\ntwo jobs in order to make ends. A recently released Census\nreport found that in 2013, 8.3 percent of workers had more than\none job, and women were more likely to have a second job--8.8\npercent versus 8.0 percent. Additionally, 6.9 percent of those\nworkers worked more than two jobs. \\1\\ Data from the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics shows fewer workers working two or more jobs.\n\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/06/about-thirteen-\nmillion-united-states-workers-have-more-than-one-job.html\n\\2\\ https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2018/4-point-9-percent-of-\nworkers-held-more-than-one-job-at-the-same-time-in-2017.htm?viewfull\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease share Federal Reserve research and or analysis\nrelated to the prevalence of workers holding more than one job.\nWhy are women more likely than men to work multiple jobs?\nAccording to the BLS, in 2017, the multiple job holding rate\nfor women was 5.3 percent, while for men it was 4.6 percent.\nWhat percentage of these jobs are seasonal jobs, such as a\nteacher holding a summer job?\nIn 2018 and 2019, the multiple job-holding rate for black\nworkers has remained higher than any other racial or ethnic\ngroup. Why is this disparity occurring for black workers? \\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\3\\ https://www.bls.gov/cps/\ncpsaat36.htm#cps_eeann_mult_jobhder.f.1\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAre workers in rural areas more likely to hold multiple\njobs than urban areas?\nAre workers in communities with higher minimum wages less\nlikely to hold multiple jobs than workers with the Federal\nminimum wage of $7.25/hour?\nThe Federal Reserve has a mandate to increase employment.\nWhat tools does the Federal Reserve have to address disparities\nin labor force participation rates including women and African\nAmericans who hold multiple jobs?\nDoes the Federal Reserve have any recommendations to\nCongress on policies that would mitigate these disparities of\nworkers who hold two or more jobs?\nA.1. The best information on the prevalence of multiple job\nholding is from two Census surveys, the Survey of Income and\nProgram Participation (SIPP) and the Current Population Survey\n(CPS). The difference between the 8.3 percent figure in the\nCensus report you cite, which derives from SIPP data, and the\nclose to 5 percent figure from the Bureau of Labor Statistics\n(BLS), which derives from the CPS, likely reflects the\ndifferent definitions of multiple job holding in these two\nreports. The Census report estimates the percent of workers who\nhad multiple jobs at any point during the year. The BLS reports\nthe percent of workers who had multiple jobs in a particular\nweek during the year. Thus, the different estimates are not\nnecessarily inconsistent with each other. The BLS reports\nmultiple job holding every month in its Employment Situation\nreport. Data for the second week of February 2020 show that 5.1\npercent of workers held more than one job.\nThe Federal Reserve Board's (Board) Survey of Household\nEconomics and Decisionmaking (SHED) also collects information\non multiple job-holding. For the fourth quarter of 2019, the\nsurvey found that 10 percent of adults had multiple jobs in the\nmonth prior to being surveyed. A variety of other information\nfrom the SHED on the well-being of U.S. workers is published in\nthe Board's Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S.\nHouseholds (report), \\4\\ including the share of workers who\nwould like more work, the share whose work schedule varies\naccording to their employer's needs, and the share who would\nnot use liquid savings to cover a $400 expense. While the\nreport issued on May 14, 2020, found that financial\ncircumstances were generally positive for most adults at the\nend of 2019, the report also included supplemental data from\nApril 2020. The supplemental survey found that financial\nconditions changed dramatically for people who experienced job\nloss or reduced hours during March 2020 as the spread of COVID-\n19 intensified in the United States.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\4\\ ``Board's Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S.\nHouseholds'' at https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2019-\nreport-economic-well-being-us-households-202005.pdf.\nQ.2. In your testimony, we also discussed labor market\ndisparities across racial and ethnic groups and across regions\nof the country.\nPlease provide research by the Federal Reserve related to\nthe following: data on the causes of disparities in\nunemployment rates across racial and ethnic groups, why it's\noccurring, and how policymakers can address these gaps.\nDoes the Federal Reserve have any recommendations to\nCongress on policies that would mitigate these disparities?\nA.2. Two papers by Federal Reserve economists on unemployment\ndisparities may be of interest to you. In a Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series (FEDS) paper ``Racial Gaps in Labor\nMarket Outcomes in the Last Four Decades and Over the Business\nCycle'', \\5\\ Federal Reserve researchers find that: (1)\nobservable characteristics (e.g., age, education, etc.) can\nexplain very little of the difference in black and white\nunemployment rates; (2) disparities in unemployment tend to\nshrink as the labor market improves, but never disappear; and\n(3) higher rates of job loss drives the disparity in black and\nwhite unemployment rates. In a Brookings Paper titled ``Okun\nRevisited: Who Benefits Most From a Strong Economy?'' \\6\\\nFederal Reserve researchers find some evidence that improvement\nin labor market outcomes for blacks and Hispanics relative to\nwhites are largest when the labor market becomes very tight.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\5\\ ``Racial Gaps in Labor Market Outcomes in the Last Four\nDecades and Over the Business Cycle'' at https://\nwww.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017071pap.pdf.\n\\6\\ ``Okun Revisited: Who Benefits Most From a Strong Economy?''\nat https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/okunrevisited-who-benefits-\nmost-from-a-strong-economy/.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs described in the first paper mentioned above, the\ndisparity in black and white unemployment rates is not easily\nexplained. By pursuing maximum employment and price stability,\nFederal Reserve policymakers can limit the disparity to some\nextent, but the gaps that remain even when the labor market is\nvery tight are best addressed by fiscal policies. Decisions\nabout which policies are best suited to reduce persistent\nunemployment rate gaps are best left to Congress.\nQ.3. You also discussed the disparities between rural and urban\nareas.\nWhat tools does the Federal Reserve have to address this\ndisparity?\nDoes the Federal Reserve have any recommendations to\nCongress on policies that would mitigate these disparities?\nA.3. The Federal Reserve does not have tools to address\npersistent disparities in economic outcomes across different\ngeographic areas. The tools we do have are those we use to\npursue maximum employment and price stability for the economy\nas a whole. Our pursuit of maximum employment benefits all\nAmericans, including those in rural areas. But persistent\nstructural causes of rural-urban disparities are best addressed\nby fiscal policies. Decisions about which policies are best\nsuited to reduce disparities between rural and urban areas are\nbest left to Congress.\nQ.4. In your exchange with Senator John Kennedy (LA), you\ndiscussed whether there is a link between our social safety-net\nprograms and participation in the labor market and argued that\nthere was no link between our safety-net programs and labor\nforce participation.\nPlease elaborate on whether there is a link between our\nsocial safety-net and labor force participation, and provide\nshare data or research if appropriate.\nDuring your comments, you noted that our safety net is not\ngenerous enough to discourage people from participating in the\nworkforce. Please explain why you believe that our safety net\ndoes not discourage participation in the labor force.\nA.4. Household decisions on whether to participate in the labor\nmarket and seek work are affected by many factors including\nwage rates, taxes, and Government benefits. Safety-net programs\nusually link eligibility to income with the goal of improving\nthe situations of lower-income households. To maintain that\nintended focus, the benefits are phased-out or unavailable to\nhouseholds with higher incomes. As a consequence, for low- and\nmoderate-income households, any improvement to household\nfinances from increased work is partially offset by the loss of\nbenefits that occurs as household income rises. Researchers\nhave found that programs with rapid phaseout of benefits, and\nthe interaction among various safety-net programs, sometimes\nleads to relatively high effective marginal tax rates. This, in\nturn, may discourage work, particularly for second earners.\nResearchers also have found that programs where the phase-out\nrange is relatively long, reduce potential disincentive\neffects.\nMore broadly, I also would note that as the labor force\nparticipation rate of prime-age workers generally declined in\nthe past couple of decades, both the average benefit level and\nthe number of recipients of Temporary Assistance to Needy\nFamilies (TANF), the primary cash assistance program, also\ndeclined. \\7\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\7\\ See, for example, figure 5 in the Congressional Budget Office\nreport ``Temporary Assistance for Needy Families: Spending and Policy\nOptions'', January 2015, at https://www.cbo.gov/publication/49887.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs you know, it is up to Congress to determine how best to\nensure safety-net programs provide the lowest work\ndisincentives as possible while still achieving the social\ngoals of the programs.\nQ.5. The Census Bureau is in the process of recruiting and\nhiring thousands of employees throughout the United States to\nconduct the 2020 Census. In fact, the Census Bureau estimates\nthat they need to hire up to 500,000 temporary, part-time\ncensus takers to get the job done.\nHow does today's tight labor market serve as a challenge\nfor the Census Bureau to achieve their goals of hiring half-a-\nmillion workers?\nA.5. The Census Bureau has noted that hiring a substantial\nnumber of workers in a low unemployment rate environment is a\n``big challenge.'' \\8\\ Indeed, in anticipation of this\nchallenge, the Census Bureau raised the hourly pay for\ntemporary Census workers in many locations. That said, prior to\nthe COVID-19 outbreak, it currently appeared that the Census\nBureau was on track to hire sufficient temporary workers. In\nparticular, the Bureau announced in early March that\nrecruitment efforts had led to over 2.6 million applicants,\nwhich they noted was ``more applicants than our estimates\nsuggest we need to hire in every office.'' \\9\\ However, in\nApril, the Bureau announced it was temporarily suspending field\ndata collection activities due to the COVID-19 outbreak and\nthat it was seeking relief to allow for an additional 120 days\nto deliver final apportionment counts. \\10\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\8\\ See https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/ready-\nto-hire-html.\n\\9\\ Id.\n\\10\\ See https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/\nstatement-covid-19-2020.html.\nQ.6. The Census Bureau increased its hourly salary to encourage\nworkers to apply. In Nevada, the pay rate is between $16 and\n$18 an hour--well above our minimum wage. Do you think the\nhigher wage offered by the Census will result in wage increases\ngenerally? Do you think the Census will increase workforce\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nparticipation rates?\nA.6. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Census Bureau\nanticipated hiring about 500,000 workers across the U.S.,\nmostly for part-time positions expected to last only a few\nweeks. Since then, the forceful measures that we as a country\nhave taken to control the spread of the virus have\nsubstantially limited many kinds of economic activity. As a\nresult, the U.S. unemployment rate was approximately 15 percent\nnationwide in April and the rate in Nevada was about 28\npercent. With unemployment expected to remain high over the\nnext several months, there will likely be many unemployed\nindividuals available to fill these temporary jobs.\nAbsent the COVID-19 outbreak, the Census Bureau would have\nbeen trying to hire workers in a very tight labor market, and\nit is possible that many of the workers would have been drawn\nin from out of the labor force. Further, if all temporary\nCensus workers were to have come from out of the labor force,\nthe labor force participation rate could have been boosted by\nabout 0.2 percentage point during May and by smaller amounts\nduring the ramp-up and ramp-down periods. However, it would\nhave been likely that some temporary census workers would have\nalready been employed, and taking on the census job in addition\nto their other jobs would have dampened the rise in the\nparticipation rate. As a point of reference, we observed\ntemporary boosts of 0.2 percentage point to the national\nparticipation rate around the 2000 and 2010 census hiring\ncycles.\nIn Nevada, as in the rest of the country, the Census Bureau\nanticipated that it would be necessary to increase the wage\nrate for temporary census workers in order to meet hiring\ngoals. Although the wages offered in Nevada before the COVID-19\noutbreak were well above the State minimum wage, the pay rate\nfor short-term census jobs would unlikely put pressure on other\nwages because these part-time, temporary jobs are not close\nsubstitutes for full-time, permanent work. That is evidenced by\nthe fact that, typically, the Census Bureau hires many people\nfrom the sidelines of the labor market such as students and\nretirees. Moreover, many low-skilled workers in Nevada before\nthe COVID-19 outbreak were earning more than the $8 per hour\nminimum wage. For instance, recent data from before the\npandemic showed that ``Interviewers,'' the occupation most\nsimilar to Census survey-takers, earned an average (mean) wage\nof $15.32 per hour and a median wage of $13.82 per hour. \\11\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\11\\ See https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nv.htm.\nQ.7. How important is a complete and accurate Census to the\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFederal Reserve Banks?\nA.7. The Federal Reserve's conduct of monetary policy is data\ndependent. Thus, making sound monetary policy decisions\nrequires having good data, including a complete and accurate\nDecennial Census. For example, data on the labor market from\nthe Current Population Survey (CPS) provides one of the most\nimportant readings on economic activity that we receive each\nmonth. The process used to construct the CPS data relies on\ndata from the Decennial Census. Thus, the accuracy of the CPS--\nand therefore the efficacy of monetary policy--relies on the\naccuracy of the Decennial census.\nQ.8. Federal Reserve's Tools During a Crisis or Recession--\nShould the Federal Reserve experiment with capping yields on\nshort to intermediate Treasury securities as Federal Reserve\nGovernor Brainard recommended? What would be the impact of\nthat?\nA.8. At the October 2019 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nmeeting, FOMC participants discussed a range of topics\nassociated with the FOMC's review of strategy, tools, and\ncommunications including the possible role of capping rates\nfurther out the yield curve. There are many different ways this\ntype of policy approach has been employed. For example, the\nBank of Japan has been targeting a 10-year yield with the goal\nof keeping long-term interest rates low and providing policy\naccommodation. Recently, the Reserve Bank of Australia\nestablished a target for shorter-maturity yields as a way of\nreinforcing its forward guidance around the likely path of its\npolicy rate over the next 2 or 3 years. And in the 1940s, the\nFederal Reserve operated to keep Treasury yields across a full\nrange of maturities below a schedule of caps as part of the\ngovernmentwide efforts to support wartime finance.\nAs noted in the minutes of the October FOMC meeting, there\nare potential benefits and costs associated with the use of\nbalance sheet tools to cap long-term interest rates. Capping\nlonger-term interest rates could help support household and\nbusiness spending. In addition, capping longer-maturity\ninterest rates using balance sheet tools, if judged as credible\nby market participants, might require a smaller amount of asset\npurchases to provide a similar amount of accommodation as a\nquantity-based program purchasing longer-maturity securities.\nHowever, determining the appropriate level of a cap on long-\nterm interest rates could be challenging. Moreover, maintaining\nsuch a cap could result in an elevated level of the Federal\nReserve's balance sheet or significant volatility in its size\nor maturity composition. In addition, managing a cap on longer-\nterm interest rates might be seen as interacting with the\nFederal debt management process.\nPolicymakers have also discussed the potential role of\ntargeting or capping shorter-term Treasury yields as a way of\nreinforcing forward guidance about the likely path of the\nFederal funds rate. Such policies could help to align market\nexpectations about the future path of the Federal funds rate\nwith the FOMC's intentions.\nAt the April 2020 FOMC meeting, a few participants again\nnoted the potential role of asset purchases as a tool to cap\nlonger-term yields or to reinforce forward guidance. These\ntopics are among the many issues being discussed by the FOMC as\npart of its review of monetary policy strategy, tools, and\ncommunications. As noted in the minutes of the April meeting,\nthe review will most likely be completed later this year.\nQ.9. We know that some communities in our Nation do not benefit\nfrom wage increases, job growth, and business success.\nDo you agree with Larry Summers who said the Federal\nReserve should promote the idea that Government spending should\nbe different in depressed areas than in successful markets?\nA.9. The Federal Reserve has been charged by Congress with\nachieving maximum employment and stable prices. The tools we\nhave to pursue these goals are not well suited to target the\ngrowth and development of individual communities. By contrast,\nfiscal and other policies that are under the purview of\nCongress are well suited for assisting depressed localities. It\nis the role of Congress and the Administration to determine how\nto best address the unequal development of these communities.\nQ.10. Do you think public spending to support economic activity\nin communities with high unemployment avoid risking a rise in\ninflation the way public spending might in more prosperous\nplaces?\nA.10. The Federal Reserve does not have the tools to address\nthe problems of localities. Fiscal policy can be a tool to\nassist these communities through both targeted tax policies and\nspending programs. In the case where the community suffers from\nrelatively high unemployment, the increased demand for local\nworkers and businesses that may result from these fiscal\npolicies should not lead to a problematic increase in\ninflation.\nQ.11. We know we have an affordable housing crisis. Not only\nare low-income families paying half or more of their income for\nrent, many families are unable to buy a starter home.\nWhat do you think the impact of the Administration's\nproposal to double the guarantee fee charged by Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac from 0.10 to 0.20 percentage points?\nHow will this affect people seeking financing to buy a\nhome?\nA.11. We monitor housing affordability carefully and are\nattentive to the effects of mortgage rates and credit\navailability on first-time homebuyers. Higher guarantee fees\nwill likely raise mortgage rates for Government Sponsored\nEnterprise (GSE) borrowers as lenders pass the fee increase\nthrough to borrowers. However, mortgage rates are not currently\na major barrier to affordability. Mortgage rates are at all-\ntime lows and have been at the low end of their historical\nrange for many years, and therefore we do not expect a 0.1\npercentage point increase in the GSEs' guarantee fee to\nmaterially affect housing affordability. Rather, high house\nprices and stagnating income growth are straining affordability\nfor many households.\nA guarantee fee increase is unlikely to disproportionately\naffect affordability for financially constrained first-time\nhomebuyers, as these borrowers tend to rely on the Federal\nHousing Administration (FHA) for financing. About half of all\nfirst-time homebuyers use an FHA mortgage, and first-time\nhomebuyers with FHA loans tend to have lower credit scores and\nlower downpayments than those with GSE loans.\nMore generally, because the change in the guarantee fee\napplies only to GSE borrowers, some of these borrowers may seek\nout other lenders if borrowing costs at the GSEs increase. The\nGSEs currently finance about 40 percent of total mortgage\nvolume, while FHA and bank portfolio lenders finance the\nmajority of the remainder. Competition may further limit the\nimpact of the fee increase on affordability.\nIt is also worth noting that a 0.1 percentage point\nincrease in the mortgage rate is a very small change both\nrelative to the level of the mortgage rate and relative to\nnormal variation in the rate. It is not rare for daily changes\nin the mortgage rate to exceed 0.1 percentage point. Even at\ntoday's historically low mortgage rates, a 0.1 percentage point\nincrease in the guarantee fee represents less than a 3 percent\nchange in the mortgage rate and would increase monthly payments\nfor new GSE borrowers by about 1 percent, on average.\nQ.12. You have spoken about the dangers of inequality. The gap\nbetween the richest and poorest households in the United States\nis at its highest point in more than 50 years. And household\ndebt is now in excess of $14 trillion, exceeding the\nprerecession high.\nHow much of our wage growth is due to increases in State\nand local minimum wages?\nA.12. In recent years, and before the onset of COVID-19, both\nincreases in minimum wages and the improving labor market\nlikely contributed to increases in wage rates. Many States\nincreased their minimum wages even though the Federal minimum\nwage has remained unchanged. Estimates suggest that about 4\npercent of all employees are paid statutory minimum wages, and\nthe effects of minimum wage increases are likely most\nnoticeable for those workers.\nSeparating out the effects of minimum wage increases on\nwage growth from the effects of an improving labor market is\ndifficult. Recent research suggests that a 10 percent increase\nin the minimum wage results in wage growth of about 4-7 percent\nfor workers that were previously below the new minimum wage.\n\\12\\ Extrapolating those estimates for those workers affected\nby the minimum wage increase to economywide wage growth suggest\nthat increases in minimum wages have likely boosted wage growth\nsome, but the improving labor market is likely responsible for\nmost of the increase in wage growth we had seen before the\nonset of COVID-19. Relatedly, research by staff at the Federal\nReserve Bank of Atlanta, again, from before the onset of COVID-\n19, finds that wage growth for low-wage workers has outpaced\nthat for higher-wage workers both in States that have raised\ntheir minimum wage and in States where the minimum wage has not\nincreased in recent years, which again points to the importance\nof the strong labor market. \\13\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\12\\ See https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905.\n\\13\\ John Robertson, ``Faster Wage Growth for the Lowest-Paid\nWorkers'', Macroblog, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, December 16,\n2019.\nQ.13. In your testimony before the House Financial Services\nCommittee, you noted that we should put the Federal budget on a\nsustainable path and reduce the Federal deficit, which is\nprojected to reach over a trillion dollars this year.\nPlease provide us with any statements you made about the\nimpact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act law on the deficit. Please\nnote the date you made those comments.\nA.13. For many years, I have spoken about the long term\nbenefits to the economy of the Federal Government implementing\npolicies that put the budget on a sustainable trajectory. The\nbenefits arise generally from the effects of higher national\nsaving on capital accumulation and productivity. Enacting\npolicies that put the budget on a sustainable path requires\nimportant judgement calls by Congress about balancing the\ntradeoffs between different policy goals including equity,\nefficiency, and public sector investment. These choices are\nproperly the responsibility of our elected officials. As\nFederal Reserve Chair, I believe that it is appropriate for me\nto discuss general fiscal policy principles, but to refrain\nfrom making judgments about particular policies. Accordingly, I\nhave refrained from discussing how this particular policy, the\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act, fits into the desired longer-term goal\nof sustainable fiscal policy.\nIn addition to my comments about the benefits to the\neconomy of putting longer-run debt and deficits on a sound\ntrajectory, I have also spoken about the helpful role fiscal\nstimulus has played in restoring growth during many of the\nrecessions over the past 50 years. Such stimulus was certainly\nhelpful during the Great Recession when the Federal funds rates\nwas pinned near zero, and the fiscal measures taken thus far in\nresponse to the current crisis--the fastest and largest\nresponse for any postwar downturn--have provided important\nsupport. While the overall policy response to date has provided\na measure of relief and stability, and will provide some\nsupport to the recovery when it comes, COVID-19 raises longer-\nterm concerns as well. We know that deeper and longer\nrecessions can leave behind lasting damage to the productive\ncapacity of the economy through unnecessary insolvencies on the\npart of households and businesses and long-term unemployment.\nIf it helps avoid long-term economic damage and leaves us with\na stronger recovery, additional fiscal support could be costly,\nbut worth it. Again, this tradeoff is one for elected\nrepresentatives, who wield powers of taxation and spending.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR JONES\nFROM JEROME H. POWELL\nQ.1. As you know, small businesses are crucial to the Nation's\neconomy. The Small Business Administration (SBA) reported that\nsmall businesses employ almost half of Alabama's workforce.\nIn the Federal Reserve's Survey on Minority Owned Small\nBusinesses it acknowledges that the majority of small business\nowners, across all races, used their personal funds to finance\ntheir business. Additionally, when financing is needed small\nbusiness owners use their credit cards.\nAre you concerned about the large number of small business\nowners using their personal finances and credit cards to fund\ntheir business as opposed to credit from financial\ninstitutions? Is the sustainable in the long-term? Do you\nbelieve this has contributed towards the stagnant rate of new\nbusinesses?\nA.1. Reliance on personal funds is common among all types of\nsmall businesses, even larger small firms (with revenues of\ngreater than $1 million), and no matter the race or ethnicity\nof the owner. \\1\\ That said, the Small Business Credit Survey\n(SBCS) finds greater reliance on personal resources among\nminority-owned firms. For example, about 28 percent of Black-,\nHispanic-, and Asian-owned firms were likely to use personal\nfunds as a primary funding source for business operations as\ncompared to 16 percent of white-owned firms, and white owners\nare more likely to report using a business credit card (as\nopposed to a personal credit card) as compared to minority\nowners. \\2\\ In addition, smaller firms, newer firms, and Black-\nand Hispanic-owned businesses are among those turning to online\nlenders for capital for their businesses. \\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The Federal Reserve Banks. 2019. ``Small Business Credit\nSurvey 2019 Report on Employer Firms'', at https://\nwww.fedsmallbusiness.org/survey/2019/report-on-employer-firms.\n\\2\\ The Federal Reserve Banks. 2019. ``Small Business Credit\nSurvey 2019 Report on Minority-Owned Firms'', at https://\nwww.fedsmallbusiness.org/survey/2019/report-on-minority-owned-firms.\n\\3\\ Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System. ``Click, Submit 2.0: An Update on Online\nLender Applicants From the Small Business Credit Survey 2019'', at\nhttps://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/medialibrary/fedsmallbusiness/files/\nclick-submit-2-0-121219.pdf.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe present crisis posed by COVID-19 has been a challenging\ntime, particularly for minority-owned businesses. Many\nminority-owned firms have lower revenues and are less connected\nto banks. For example, the SBCS indicates that black-owned\nfirms are more likely than others to turn to a Community\nDevelopment Financial Institution (CDFI). The smallest\nbusinesses lack both the financing options of larger businesses\nand the in-house financial expertise to tap the options that\nmay be available to them. Especially during the current crisis,\nthere is a significant need for technical assistance, such as\nthat provided by CDFIs. In response, on May 1, the Federal\nReserve opened up its Paycheck Protection Program Lending\nFacility (PPPLF) to nonbanks, including CDFI loan funds, to\nprovide liquidity to expand their reach in lower-income\ncommunities.\nMoreover, as part of its broad effort to support the\neconomy, the Federal Reserve developed the Main Street Lending\nProgram (MSLP) to help credit flow to small and medium-sized\nbusinesses that were in sound financial condition before the\npandemic. The MSLP was modified in May to expand the loan\noptions available to businesses, and increased the maximum size\nof businesses that are eligible for support under the program.\nThe changes expanded the pool of businesses eligible to borrow\nthrough the program, lowered the minimum size for certain\nloans, and adjusted other features in response to public input.\nThe Federal Reserve is continuing to consider ways to increase\nthe scope of this program.\nQ.2. During the hearing you mentioned that people receiving\neconomic benefits like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance\nProgram (SNAP), school nutrition programs, health care,\nchildcare assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families\n(TANF) and housing are receiving less assistance than they have\nin the past. I want to expand on the complexities of economic\nassistance particularly for workers that have to turn down pay\nraises or promotions due to benefit cliffs.\nBenefit cliffs is the sudden and unexpected decrease in\npublic benefits that can occur with small increase in earnings.\nWhen income increases, families can lose some or all economic\nsupports, but the increase in earnings does not cover the costs\nassociated with losing economic support.\nThe Atlanta Federal Reserve has done research into benefit\ncliffs and some States have started working on solutions to\ndecrease the dramatic cliff. Do you believe there are economic\nconsequences to benefits cliffs? What do you recommend for\nCongress to do to help alleviate the cliff?\nA.2. Low-income support programs include both means-tested\ntransfer programs (Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance\nProgram, and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, for\nexample) and some tax credits (the Earned Income Tax Credit and\nthe Child Tax Credit, for example). Safety-net programs usually\nlink eligibility to income with the goal of improving the\nsituations of lower-income households. To maintain that\nintended focus, the benefits are phased out or unavailable to\nhouseholds with higher incomes. As a household's income\nincreases and moves into a range where benefits are phased-out,\nthe ``effective marginal tax rate'' that the household may face\ncan increase substantially and sometimes move up toward 100\npercent if multiple program benefits are reduced or lost. \\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\4\\ In addition to research by economists at the Federal Reserve\nBank of Atlanta, see also, for example, calculations by C. Eugene\nSteurle (Urban Institute) in his Congressional testimony ``Marginal Tax\nRates and 21st Century Social Welfare Reform'' for a joint hearing of\nthe Subcommittee on Human Resources, Committee on Ways and Means and\nSubcommittee on Nutrition, Committee on Agriculture, June 25, 2015, at\nhttps://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/56291/2000275-\nMarginal-Tax-Rates-and-21st-Century-Social-Welfare-Reform.pdf; and the\nCongressional Budget Office report, ``Effective Marginal Tax Rates for\nLow- and Moderate-Income Workers in 2016'', November 2015, at https://\nwww.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114thcongress-2015-2016/reports/50923-\nmarginaltaxrates.pdf.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEvaluations of whether these programs are well-designed,\nrequire--to an important extent--a judgment about the relative\nimportance of helping those who are struggling economically\nversus potential work disincentives. That said, it is not the\nappropriate role of the Federal Reserve to make such judgments.\nRather, it is the role of elected officials to ascertain\nwhether social safety-net programs, both on the tax and\nspending sides of the budget, are well-designed.\nQ.3. As you know, the Federal Reserve, along with the other\nfour regulators, recently proposed a rule that would clarify\nthe definition of covered funds under the Volcker Rule in an\neffort to increase long-term investments in companies across\nthe country.\nThis rulemaking should strike a balance between ensuring\nbanks are able to engage in appropriate long-term investments\nin funds that can help spur innovation while not undermining\nsafety and soundness.\nDo you believe that modifying the definition of covered\nfunds to allow banks to provide permissible long-term\ninvestments to businesses in Alabama and across the country\nwould threaten the safety and soundness of the financial\nindustry?\nA.3. On January 30, 2020, the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Securities and\nExchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (the Agencies) jointly issued a notice of proposed\nrulemaking (NPR) \\5\\ addressing the covered fund provisions of\nthe Volcker Rule regulations. The NPR includes provisions that\nwould provide banking entities increased flexibility to invest\nin and sponsor certain funds. If finalized, the proposal may\nfacilitate lending and capital investment in certain\nbusinesses, in particular by excluding from the definition of\n``covered fund'' credit funds and venture capital funds, both\nof which may provide an additional conduit for banking entities\nto finance business activities, particularly in areas where\nsuch financing may not be readily available.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\5\\ See https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/\nfiles/volcker-rule-fr-notice-20200130.pdf.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Volcker Rule's covered fund provisions currently do not\napply, and would not apply under the proposal, to banking\nentities' direct lending to businesses, or direct merchant\nbanking investments in businesses.\nWith respect to the two proposed exclusions for venture\ncapital funds and credit funds, the preamble to the NPR noted\nthat the Agencies do not believe that the proposed covered fund\nexclusions raise the concerns that the Volcker Rule was\nintended to address. The proposal included several eligibility\nrequirements to appropriately limit the scope of the proposed\nexclusions (for example, a prohibition on banking entities'\nguaranteeing the performance of these funds). In addition, all\nof the proposed new exclusions would require a banking entity's\ninvestment in, and relationship with, a fund to meet applicable\nsafety and soundness and conflict of interest standards.\nQ.4. Historically, wages in the manufacturing sector are higher\nthan those in the service sector. Men are more likely to hold\njobs at any skill level in manufacturing, while women are more\nlikely to hold jobs in the service sector, a sector that pays\nconsiderably less than manufacturing.\nWomen hold 77 percent of the jobs in health care and\neducation--fast-growing fields in the service sector that\neclipse the entire goods-producing sector of the economy.\nThe growing number of women in the workforce reflects a\nlong-running evolution away from male-dominated industries like\nmanufacturing toward the service side of the economy, where\nwomen have an edge.\nIs the Federal Reserve aware of this pattern of an increase\nof women in the service sector workforce while earning\nsignificantly less than men in manufacturing workforce?\nA.4.\nPrior to the COVID-19 crisis, women comprised just over 50\npercent of all nonfarm payroll jobs. Breaking that down by\nindustry shows that women made up a much larger share of\nemployment in some industries than in others (Figure 1). For\nexample, women comprised just about 80 percent of all jobs in\neducation and health services, by far the largest share of any\nindustry. In contrast, women comprised about only 30 percent of\nall jobs in manufacturing. Women also comprised about half or\nmore of jobs in a number of other service sectors, including\nleisure and hospitality and retail trade.\nThe composition of employment across industries for men and\nwomen together has been shifting away from manufacturing, which\nlargely employs men, and towards service sectors, which largely\nemploys women (Figure 2). As a whole, manufacturing tends to\npay a higher hourly rate per job than service sectors, but that\nis not true for each service sector (Figure 3). For much of the\npostwar period, manufacturing jobs paid more than education and\nhealth service jobs. That changed around the year 2000, when\nthe average hourly pay rate in education and health service\njobs eclipsed that rate for manufacturing jobs. Education and\nhealth service jobs prior to the COVID-19 crisis paid about\n$2.25/hour more than manufacturing. However, manufacturing paid\nmuch more than noneducation and health service jobs.\nIn addition to monitoring employment trends in formal\nemployment, the Federal Reserve also tracks employment patterns\nin informal gig work. Based on the Federal Reserve's recent\n``Survey of Household Economic Decisionmaking'', \\6\\ men and\nwomen are similarly likely to earn money through gig work.\nRecent research on wages in the gig economy also observes that\namong rideshare drivers, women are paid less because of\ndifferences in how and when they work. \\7\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\6\\ See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/\nother20200514a.htm.\n\\7\\ Cook, Cody, Rebecca Diamond, Jonathan Hall, John A. List, and\nPaul Oyer. ``The Gender Earnings Gap in the Gig Economy: Evidence From\nOver a Million Rideshare Drivers'', No. w24732. National Bureau of\nEconomic Research, 2018.\nQ.5. Over the last few years, the annual average earnings\ngrowth for American workers has remained below 3 percent. Yet\nat the same time, average house prices have increased more than\n5 percent.\nRising housing costs coupled with relatively stagnant wage\ngrowth has made it hard for consumers to save for a downpayment\nand the costs associated with buying a home like inspectors and\nappraisers.\nAdditionally, there are large disparities in home ownership\nbetween African Americans and their white counterparts. 73.1\npercent of white Americans owned a home at the end of the\nsecond quarter of 2019 compared to 40.6 percent of African\nAmericans and 46.6 percent of Hispanic American.\nWhat, if any, are the consequences of not addressing the\nlarge home ownership disparities among minorities?\nA.5. Because a home is the largest asset for many households,\nthe racial home ownership gap has implications for the racial\nwealth gap. \\8\\ Rising house prices increase the wealth of\nhomeowners, who have locked in their housing costs to a large\ndegree, while making it more difficult for renters to afford a\ndownpayment. If rents continue to increase along with prices,\nit will be even more difficult for renters to save and build\nwealth.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\8\\ For an analysis of the components of the racial wealth gap,\nsee https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/fedsnotes/recent-\ntrends-in-wealth-holding-by-race-and-ethnicity-evidence-from-the-\nsurvey-of-consumer-finances-20170927.htm.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe gaps in home ownership by race and ethnicity are a\nconcern, and we included an analysis of differences in home\nownership rates in the February 2017 issue of the Monetary\nPolicy Report. There are a number of factors contributing to\nthese gaps. For example, the African American and Hispanic\npopulations have been more strongly affected by restrictions on\nthe availability of mortgages to low-score borrowers,\nparticularly in the postcrisis contraction in mortgage credit.\nHowever, it should be noted that the home ownership gap has\nbeen persistent for many decades and only widened a bit during\nthe postcrisis period.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SINEMA\nFROM JEROME H. POWELL\nQ.1. Businesses in Arizona are struggling to find workers with\nthe skills they need. What effects have skilled labor shortages\nhad on economic growth and social mobility?\nA.1. As we know, skill shortages arise in a tight labor market.\nWhile tight labor markets can make hiring difficult for\nbusinesses, they bring many benefits to workers. In particular,\nindividuals without job opportunities previously are more\nlikely to be employed in a tight labor market and, once\nemployed, they are more likely to receive valuable training.\nThe increase in skills from work experience and training can\nincrease their attachment to the labor force and, perhaps,\nincrease aggregate employment and economic output in the longer\nrun. As a result, the advantages that a tight labor market\nprovides to disadvantaged workers can increase social mobility.\nThe contrast between the labor market conditions that\nprompted this question just a few weeks ago and the current\nsituation highlights the scope and speed of the current\neconomic downturn. The coronavirus has left a devastating human\nand economic toll in its wake. As a Nation, we have temporarily\nwithdrawn from many kinds of economic and social activity to\nhelp slow the spread of the virus. Congress and the Federal\nReserve have acted with unprecedented speed and force to\naddress the economic consequences. The overall policy response\nto date has provided a measure of relief and stability, and\nwill provide some support to the recovery when it comes. The\nFederal Reserve will continue to use our tools to their fullest\nuntil the crisis has passed and the economic recovery is well\nunder way.\nAdditional Material Supplied for the Record\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nLISCC GUIDANCE RESPONSE LETTER SUBMITTED BY CHAIRMAN CRAPO\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\n[all]",

James E.\nRisch, chairman of the committee, presiding.\nPresent: Senators Risch [presiding], Gardner, Romney,\nBarrasso, Young, Cruz, Menendez, Cardin, Shaheen, Coons, Kaine,\nand Markey.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES E. RISCH,\nU.S. SENATOR FROM IDAHO\nThe Chairman. Our committee will come to order.\nThis morning we are going to, on the 30th anniversary, or\nthe day after the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square\nmassacre, honor all those brave citizens of China who believed\nin a freer future for their China. Please join me in a brief\nmoment of silence for them, including those who lost their\nlives.\n[A moment of silence.]\nThe Chairman. Thank you.\nIn June 1989, the photo of a lone Chinese citizen standing\ndown a column of People's Liberation Army tanks in Tiananmen\nSquare was the snapshot seen around the world of the Chinese\npeople's suffering.\nThe Chinese Government's modes of repression today are\nperhaps more difficult to capture in a single image but are,\nnevertheless, omnipresent, pernicious, and increasingly brazen.\nEvery day is Tiananmen Square, but you do not see the pictures\nand you do not see the way that they are treated because it is\ndone surreptitiously. Though perpetrated by the Chinese\nCommunist Party for decades, human rights abuses have\nintensified under President Xi Jinping.\nAs we sit here today, there are between 1 million and 2\nmillion Muslims locked up by Chinese authorities in internment\ncamps, where they face political indoctrination, isolation,\nabuse, and death. For every person in the camps, dozens more\nwonder what has happened to their loved ones.\nIn general, freedom of religion is extinct in China. The\nChinese Communist Party is bent on interfering in the selection\nof the next Dalai Lama. It has shut down churches and detained\nChristian pastors. And the Chinese Government is working on\ncrafting so-called correct interpretations of the Bible. All of\nthis is part of explicit government policies aimed at stripping\nreligious organizations of their independence and forcing them\nto align with the Chinese Communist Party.\nThose who bear the greatest brunt of the Communist Party's\ndisrespect for the rule of law are those who stand up to defend\nit. In the 4 years after the Chinese Communist Party's July\n2015 crackdown, numerous human rights lawyers and other\nadvocates have received multiyear sentences. Those not in\nprison face restrictions on their freedom of movement and other\nforms of harassment and intimidation.\nAlongside these seismic abuses of power, we should not\nforget the injustices faced by all Chinese citizens each day.\nIt is every censored Internet search or text message. It is the\ninability to buy a plane ticket because of a low, quote, social\ncredit score, unquote. It is every facial scan.\nThese examples demonstrate technology's role as an\naccelerant in the Communist Party's repression today. The\nChinese Government and Chinese companies are pioneering an\nintrusive mass surveillance system. This is a serious challenge\nthat we will pay particular attention to in this hearing and in\nthe committee's work on command.\nAnother challenge is the spread of Chinese human rights\npolicies outside of the mainland. Chinese companies are\nexporting technology to regimes with poor human rights records\nand training authoritarian governments in information\nmanagement and new media. China is seeking to redefine human\nrights norms at the United Nations, and it is exploiting the\nopenness of advanced democracies to chill freedom of\nexpression, particularly discussion about China itself.\nThis is rule by fear. This is a regime that believes it\nbestows rights to its people and can take them away just as\nquickly as it bestows them. A regime that has appointed itself\nthe judge of Chinese culture and identity, even though the\nbirth of China predates the Chinese Communist Party rule by\nmore than 5,000 years. And a regime that inserts the state into\nthe facets of life that best promote human flourishing: faith,\nfamily, and civic engagement.\nThe United States should make the defense of intrinsic\nvalues like fundamental freedoms and human rights a more\ncentral part of our approach to China. That we stand for\nfreedom and human rights as well as prosperity is an advantage\nthat we should not shy away from.\nI want to thank everyone for their interest in this topic\nand how we can stand up for the Chinese people, as well as\nprotect our own societies.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Ranking Member Senator\nMenendez for his opening remarks.\nSTATEMENT OF HON. ROBERT MENENDEZ,\nU.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY\nSenator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for\ncalling this important hearing. And let me thank in advance our\nthree extraordinary witnesses.\nThe 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre\nprovides an important opportunity to discuss human rights in\nChina and the importance of a values-driven American foreign\npolicy. Indeed, the events of 30 years ago continue to resonate\nbecause of our collective commitment to building a more just\nand decent world.\nUnfortunately, China has continued down the path it began\nthat fateful day. With Xi Jinping declaring himself president\nfor life, cracking down on civil society and human rights,\nintroducing an Orwellian system of mass surveillance, advancing\nmilitarily in the South China Sea, and with predatory economic\npractices in Africa and the western hemisphere, China's\ntrajectory is clear.\nUnder the guise of the so-called reeducation campaigns, the\nCCP has brutally forced nearly a million Uyghurs in Xinjiang\ninto heavily surveilled, forced labor camps, a model Xi may\nintend to expand throughout the country.\nTibetans, facing wide-scale repression and harsh controls\non religious, educational, cultural, and linguistic freedom,\nwere in many respects the test subjects for the sort of ethnic\nsurveillance we see in Xinjiang.\nCCP authorities likewise repress Christians and Falun Gong\nmembers who face forced labor and torture for their beliefs.\nLawyers, journalists, students, labor activists, and human\nrights defenders are all at risk. And behind its Great\nFirewall, China has created a social credit system that rewards\nthe, quote/unquote, good and punishes the, quote/unquote, bad.\nSadly, China's authoritarian model is appealing in all too\nmany places around the globe where dictators and despots are\nhappy to accept China's assistance in repressing their own\npeople. From Cambodia to Venezuela to Angola, we find the\nCommunist Party of China sharing the technologies and\ntechniques they have refined to crush democracy in their own\ncountry.\nDeveloping an effective policy that keeps our values at the\ncenter of our China policy is uniquely challenging and\nincreasingly urgent. Just being more confrontational with China\ndoes not make us more competitive with China. Nor does simple\nconfrontation help us resolve core human rights concerns.\nAs we reflect on those lost and the events of Tiananmen, we\nmust also look inward. We must ensure our values, grounded in\ninternational human rights, guide our efforts to strategically\nand coherently respond to China's rising power and growing\nauthoritarianism.\nUnfortunately, the administration has simply failed to use\nour cherished time-tested principles and tools to universally\nand strategically support and promote human rights. And this is\nsimply unacceptable. To confusion and dismay, last week\nSecretary Pompeo announced the establishment of a new\ncommission to make sure that we have, quote, a solid definition\nof human rights. Well, the solid definition already exists. We\ndo not need to redefine human rights. We need to defend and\nprotect them.\nWe must leverage all of our tools in our toolkit. We must\ncultivate robust diplomatic and security partnerships. We must\nbolster our own presence. We must address our own economic\nchallenges and pursue more adroit economic statecraft abroad.\nAnd core American values must be the centerpiece of our foreign\npolicy.\nWe can start by investing in institutions that support\ndemocratic governance globally and stand with those who seek\nfreedom.\nWe must remember what made America a leader of nations. It\nwas not just the strength of our military or the dynamism of\nour economy. It was the enduring power of our ideals.\nThis committee must step up to advocate for more than a\ntransactional approach to human rights because democracy will\nnot defend itself.\nIn the memory of those who died for their belief in\ndemocracy in China 30 years ago, we must remind ourselves of\nthe sheer power of an informed democratic society living in\nfreedom. We must lead with the values that made us great to be\na beacon for those around the world. In doing so, we offer a\nbetter model, one which the people of China demonstrated 30\nyears ago has universal appeal, not limited to a civilization\nor a particular nation. We must equally advocate, for example,\nfor peaceful protesters in Sudan attacked by their government\nover the weekend.\nAnd it is these values that inspire others to partner with\nus and to rally with us in facing down the greatest challenges\nof our time.\nWe owe those who stood in Tiananmen Square 30 years ago and\nthe Chinese people nothing less today.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nThe Chairman. Thank you.\nWe now have three outstanding witnesses that are going to\ntestify. We will hear from them, and then we will have a round\nof questions.\nFirst, I want to introduce Mr. Xiao Qiang. He is a research\nscientist at the University of California-Berkeley School of\nInformation and the founder and editor-in-chief of China\nDigital Times, a bilingual China news website launched in 2003.\nThough a theoretical physicist by training, he became a full-\ntime human rights advocate after the Tiananmen Square massacre\nin 1989. His current research focuses on state censorship,\npropaganda, and disinformation, as well as emerging big data\nand artificial intelligence-empowered state surveillance in\nChina.\nMr. Xiao, we would love to hear from you.\nSTATEMENT OF XIAO QIANG, FOUNDER AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, CHINA\nDIGITAL TIMES, BERKELEY, CA\nMr. Xiao. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and respectable members\nof the committee.\nJune 5th, this very day, exactly 30 years ago, I was\nstudying a Ph.D. program in the University of Notre Dame. After\nseeing on TV the PLA soldiers open fire on peaceful\ndemonstrators in my home city, Beijing, I abandoned my\nastrophysics program and caught the first flight home to China.\nFor 2 months in a time of terror, I tried to find out what had\nhappened, contacting people in hiding, dodging police, and\nhanding over donations raised abroad to the victims and their\nfamilies.\nAnd I came back from that trip with one full realization. I\nrealized that the name of the People's Republic of China itself\nis a lie. This government has never been the people's, nor is\nit a republic. China's National People's Congress is not\nelected by Chinese people. And China's People's Liberation Army\nonly opened fire on people on the street of Lhasa, Beijing, and\nthese days in the towns and villages in Xinjiang. When\nchallenged, this lie could only be maintained through brutal\nviolence and through the fear created through such violence.\nAfter 30 years, the Chinese communist regime has not only\nsurvived but also increased its power. Many Western politicians\nhave been convinced that the wealth of the middle class and\nthat the rise of the Internet will transform China from\nauthoritarianism to democracy. But the reality is that Chinese\nrulers have taken advantage of their inclusion in the\nglobalized trading process, significantly growing its economy\nunder the CCP-controlled state capitalism and are refusing to\nallow any political liberalization.\nAnd President Xi Jinping today, after he scrapped the\npresidential term limits written in the Chinese constitution--\nhe became the most powerful dictator in the world.\nAnd there is another threatening trend, threatening the\nhope of freedom of China. The digitalization of Chinese society\nis turning China into a surveillance state. Facial recognition,\nvoice recognition, DNA collection, 200 million civilian cameras\neverywhere, social credit system, a new generation of digital\ntechnology, including artificial intelligence and big data\nanalysis, is empowering the state to control, to monitor, to\nmanipulate China's vast population in scalable fashion, at ease\nand with capacity to micro-target individuals. It can also help\nthe state to identify and quash opposition in advance. China is\nexporting these technologies to other autocratic regimes around\nthe world, normalizing and enabling a global authoritarianism.\nLadies and gentlemen, the United States must develop an\neffective policy to stop this Chinese surveillance tech\nindustry, disrupting its supply chains, and through working\nwith allies, prevent China from using its government-controlled\ncompanies to advance its digital totalitarian interests in\nother parts of the world.\nWe must have no illusions. It is the existence of the\nChinese Communist Party dictatorship that abuses and threatens\nthe liberty and the safety of Chinese people and people's lives\nanywhere in this increasingly interconnected globe. But this is\nnot a clash of civilizations. It is a clash between two\ndifferent political systems, between democracy and a one-party\ndictatorship. We just need to look to Taiwan where Chinese\ncivilization works well with democratic governance. We can also\nlook to Japan, South Korea, and India.\nAs a son of China and a proud citizen of the United States\nof America, I am asking each of you, when making the best\npossible China policy that defends the value and the interests\nof American people, please also make it align with and support\nChinese people's struggle for human rights and freedom because\nwe share a common humanity.\nThirty years after Tiananmen, the Chinese Communist Party\ncontinues to rule China, rule Chinese people through fear. But\nthose who rule by fear also live in fear. Last week, I was\nvisiting Berlin and had some time to take a walk in the\nstreets. Where the Berlin Wall once stood now there is a dark\nline on the ground through the city, some parts are hiking\ntrails. But I also saw something else: names of victims of the\nNazis engraved in shining brass plaques, 70,000 of them spread\nthroughout Berlin city. I started to envision that one day in\nBeijing, the names of those who died during the Tiananmen\nmassacre will be engraved into the city's roads, building\nwalls, and parks and on Tiananmen Square, the gate of heavenly\npeace. I asked myself, where is Hitler's Nazi Germany now?\nWhere is the former Soviet Union? Where is Suharto's Indonesia\nor Pinochet's Chile? They are all gone because the ultimate\nspirit of human dignity is more enduring than tanks and machine\nguns or even they are empowered by artificial intelligence and\nspaceships. Freedom will prevail in West or East, in Berlin or\nin Beijing.\nMr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to ask\nyou close your eyes for 1 minute. Just close your eyes. Can you\nsee millions of Chinese faces on Tiananmen Square? Millions,\npeaceful, fearless, young, full of longing for freedom. Can you\nsee the goddess of democracy standing tall in Tiananmen? Can\nyou see the brave young man, his white shirt with two plastic\nshopping bags in his hands standing still in front of a column\nof moving tanks?\nChinese people want, deserve, and demand human rights and\nfreedom just like American people, just like people anywhere in\nthe world. The only reason these voices cannot be fully heard\nis because they are being suppressed by the Chinese Government.\nYes, it is the most powerful authoritarian state in the world.\nThe regime is not just domestically oppressive, but it is\nbecoming externally aggressive like an empire.\nI would like to end my testimony with a quote from Mahatma\nGandhi, a great man from another great civilization.\n``When I despair, I remember that all through history the\nway of truth and love has always won. There have been tyrants\nand murderers, and for a time, they can seem invincible, but in\nthe end, they always fall. Think of it always.''\nThank you.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Xiao follows:]\nPrepared Statement of Xiao Qiang\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Thank you very much. We appreciate that\ntestimony.\nWe will now hear from Sophie Richardson. She is the China\nDirector at Human Rights Watch. Dr. Richardson is the author of\nnumerous articles on domestic Chinese political reform,\ndemocratization, and human rights in Cambodia, China,\nIndonesia, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Under her\nleadership, Human Rights Watch has documented a myriad of human\nrights abuses by the Chinese Government, including most\nrecently the use of mass surveillance and the emerging\ntechnologies issue.\nDr. Richardson.\nSTATEMENT OF SOPHIE RICHARDSON, Ph.D., CHINA DIRECTOR, HUMAN\nRIGHTS WATCH, NEW YORK, NY\nDr. Richardson. Chairman Risch, Ranking Member Menendez,\nmembers of the committee, thank you for inviting us to join you\non this very somber anniversary.\nAmong the most disturbing aspects of President Xi's rule is\nChinese authority's development and deployment of surveillance\ntechnology that aspires to engineer a dissent-free society.\nAuthorities deny people any meaningful privacy rights from the\ngovernment's prying eyes, and coupled with a deeply politicized\njudicial system, the lack of a free press and the denial of\npolitical rights, people across the country have no ability to\nchallenge these developments or even truly understand how\nsociety is being transformed until it impacts them or their\nfamilies directly.\nWhat are some examples of this technology? One of the\nMinistry of Public Security's most ambitious and privacy-\nviolating big data projects is the police cloud system, which\nappears to be national. The system scoops up information from\npeople's medical records to their supermarket memberships to\ndelivery records, much of which is linked to people's unique\nnational identification numbers. The police cloud system aims\nto track where the individuals have been, who they are with,\nand what they have been doing, as well as make predictions\nabout their future activities. In effect, the system watches\neveryone, and the police can arbitrarily designate anyone a\nthreat who requires greater surveillance, especially if they\nare deemed to be undermining stability.\nThe Chinese Government is also developing a national social\ncredit system that rewards good behavior and punishes the bad.\nAt present, it is a blacklisting system in which behaviors the\nauthorities disapprove of, from abnormal petitioning to eating\non the subway, can affect one's ability to obtain services such\nas getting mortgages or traveling on high-speed trains, or even\nenrolling children in public schools.\nTo what extent the social credit system will evolve and how\nit will interact with the police systems of mass surveillance\nremains an open question.\nIn December 2017, we reported on Xinjiang authorities'\ncompulsory collection of DNA samples, fingerprints, iris scans,\nand blood types of all citizens in the region between the ages\nof 12 and 65, in part under the guise of a free public health\ncare program. That campaign significantly expanded the\nauthorities' collection of biodata beyond previous government\nefforts in the region. It did not appear that the government\ndisclosed to the public or to participants the full range of\nhow the collected medical information would be used and\ndisseminated or for how long it would be storied, and it\nappears that people were given little information about the\nprogram or the ability to opt out of it.\nWe discovered that a U.S.-based company, Thermo Fisher\nScientific, had sold DNA sequencers to the Xinjiang Public\nSecurity Bureau during this period. After inquiries from Human\nRights Watch, Members of Congress, and the New York Times, the\ncompany agreed to stop selling that particular technology in\nthat particular region. However, it remains unclear whether it\nhas adopted due diligence policies that might prevent such\nproblems in the future.\nMost recently, Human Rights Watch reverse-engineered an app\nused by the police and government officials in Xinjiang that is\nconnected to a police mass surveillance system called the\nIntegrated Joint Operations Platform, or IJOP, which aggregates\ninformation about all residents of Xinjiang under the guise of\nproviding public security. Our research into the app revealed\nthat the authorities consider many ordinary and legal\nbehaviors, such as, quote, not socializing with neighbors,\nquote, often avoiding using the front door, using WhatsApp or\nsimply being related to someone who had obtained a new phone\nnumber, as suspicious. The app then flags such people for\ninterrogation, some of whom are then sent to Xinjiang's\npolitical education camps where they are arbitrarily and\nindefinitely detained.\nThe consequences of these technologies across China are\nenormous. The state is now not only able to peer into virtually\nevery aspect of a person's public and private life, but is also\nclearly using information gained that way to reward and punish\npeople outside any discernible legal scheme.\nMajor Chinese tech companies now operate around the world.\nIn 2014, we documented ZTE's sale of telecom surveillance\ntechnology to the Ethiopian Government, which used that\nequipment to monitor its political opponents. IFlytek, one of\nChina's major voice recognition companies, which is helping the\nMinistry of Public Security in building a national voice\npattern database, is also working MIT. China Electronics\nTechnology Group Corporation, a state-owned defense\nconglomerate behind Xinjiang's IJOP system, has numerous\nsubsidiaries, including Hikvision, a major surveillance camera\nmanufacturer whose products are used around the world,\nincluding in the U.S.\nWhat can be done about any of this?\nTo combat the Chinese Government's expanding use of\nsurveillance technology in the commission of human rights\nviolations, we urge the United States to impose appropriate\nexport control mechanisms, including by adding companies to\nexisting export control lists and imposing targeted sanctions\nunder the Global Magnitsky Act.\nWe also encourage consideration of end-user bans.\nU.S. companies and universities working in this sector\nshould be encouraged to adopt due diligence policies to ensure\nthat they are not engaged in or enabling serious human rights\nviolations.\nWe urge the swift adoption of the Uyghur Human Rights\nPolicy Act, which we were very glad to see was voted out of\nthis committee.\nWhile there is much work for the U.S. to do to limit\nChinese Government and Chinese Communist Party encroachments on\nhuman rights abuses in the United States, particularly with\nrespect to realms such as academic freedom, those strategies\nmust place at their core welcoming and protecting the rights of\npeople from China who come here in order to be able to freely\nexercise those rights.\nFinally, the U.S. and ideally members of this body today\nshould recommit their support to independent civil society\nacross China. That community is under sustained assault and it\nneeds sustained attention from the U.S., including both\nCongress and the executive branch. People from that community\npaid a terrible price at Tiananmen. They have paid it over the\npast 3 decades. Yet, they have not abandoned the Tiananmen\nspirit and nor should the U.S.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\n[The prepared statement of Dr. Richardson follows:]\nPrepared Statement of Sophie Richardson, Ph.D.\nChairman Risch, Ranking Member Menendez, members of the Committee,\nthank you for inviting me to testify on this somber anniversary.\nHuman Rights Watch began reporting on human rights violations\ncommitted by the Chinese government in the mid-1980s, and while many of\nus had hoped that the government's greater interactions with the\ninternational community and institutions over the subsequent years\nwould eventually lead to greater respect for human rights, the reality\nis the reverse: under President Xi Jinping, not only is the state\ncarrying out gross human rights violations, including heightened\nrepression of peaceful activists and the arbitrary detention of one\nmillion Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang, it is also aggressively attempting\nto undermine international institutions critical to protecting the\nhuman rights of people around the world.\nWe now know that the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre was not an\naberration, but an expression of deep-seated authoritarianism embraced\nby successive administrations in Beijing. The U.S. response to\nTiananmen was strong and principled, not just in rhetoric, but in\nactions. Over time, however, the fate of the sanctions imposed by the\nU.S. in response to Tiananmen represented a wavering commitment to\npressing for reform in China: those sanctions have been slowly eroded\non paper, superseded by business interests, and are hardly reflective\nof Chinese authorities' technological prowess. The sanctions, which\nwere designed to limit the export of ``equipment or instruments related\nto crime control and detection,'' meant that the U.S. could not sell\ngear, such as handcuffs. But they do not limit the export of the kinds\nof technology Chinese police now deploy to maintain ``public order''--\nequipment like DNA sequencers, the sale of which remains permissible\nunder U.S. law.\nOur research is only a snapshot of an evolving system of mass\nsurveillance: these systems are generating massive datasets--\nunprecedented in human history--of personal information, people's\nbehavior, relationships, and movements. The Chinese police are\nresearching ways to use such information to understand in a more fine-\ngrained way how people lead their lives. The goal is apparently to\nidentify patterns of, and predict, the everyday life and resistance of\nits population, and, ultimately, to engineer and control reality.\nhuman rights under president xi jinping\nSince President Xi assumed leadership as the Chinese Communist\nParty (CCP) general secretary in late 2012, his government has actively\nsought to roll back all of the modest human rights gains made over the\nprevious decades.\nInside China, Xi's government unleashed a ferocious crackdown on\nindependent civil society, arbitrarily detaining and prosecuting, on\nharsh and baseless charges, human rights lawyers, writers, journalists,\nand feminist activists. Repression of ethnic minorities and religious\ncommunities has grown exponentially, leading to the current crisis in\nXinjiang. The government has adopted a slew of blatantly abusive laws,\nmany of them in tension with China's international obligations and its\nown Constitution. It has killed off legal reform, strengthened the\nParty and Xi's control over state institutions; in March 2018, the CCP\nremoved term limits on his presidency. Space for any independent\nactivism or peaceful criticism is virtually gone, perhaps best embodied\nby the July 2017 death under guard of 2010 Nobel Peace Prize laureate\nLiu Xiaobo, or the dramatically shrinking space for human rights in\nHong Kong.\nOutside China, Xi's government has aggressively engaged in\nundermining key international human rights institutions, particularly\nat the United Nations. Beijing's trillion-dollar Belt and Road\nInitiative has no human rights safeguards; its development banks,\nincluding the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, are notoriously\nweak in this regard. Human Rights Watch has detailed Chinese government\nand Communist Party efforts to limit academic freedom and undercut\nlabor standards outside China. As important, Beijing tries to control\nand intimidate diaspora communities, ranging from pressuring\ngovernments to forcibly return people seeking asylum to censoring\nWeChat communications between democratically elected representatives\nand their constituents.\nmass surveillance technology inside and outside china\nAmong the most disturbing aspects of Xi's rule and the current\nsituation: Chinese authorities' development and deployment of\nsurveillance technology that aspires to engineer a dissent-free\nsociety. Chinese authorities deny people any meaningful privacy rights\nfrom the government's prying eyes, and, coupled with a deeply\npoliticized judicial system, the lack of a free press, and the denial\nof political rights, people across the country have no ability to\nchallenge these developments or even truly understand how society is\nbeing transformed until it impacts them--or their families--directly.\nWhat are some examples of this technology? One of the Ministry of\nPublic Security's most ambitious and privacy-violating big data\nprojects is the ``Police Cloud'' system, which appears to be national.\nThe system scoops up information, from people's medical history, to\ntheir supermarket membership, to delivery records, much of which is\nlinked to people's unique national identification numbers. The Police\nCloud system aims to track where the individuals have been, who they\nare with, and what they have been doing, as well as make predictions\nabout their future activities. It is designed to uncover relationships\nbetween events and people ``hidden'' to the police by analyzing, for\nexample, who has been staying in a hotel or travelling together. In\neffect, the system watches everyone, and the police can arbitrarily\ndesignate anyone a threat who requires greater surveillance, especially\nif they are seen to be ``undermining stability''--an alarmingly\nambiguous construct. It's critical to understand that there is no\ntransparency in such a designation, and no way to challenge it--this is\nnot the same as predictive policing in the U.S.\nThe Chinese government is also developing a national ``social\ncredit system'' that rewards ``good'' behavior and punishes the\n``bad.'' At present, it is a blacklisting system in which behaviors the\nauthorities disapprove--from ``abnormal petitioning'' to eating on the\nsubway--can affect one's ability to obtain services, such as getting\nmortgages and travelling on high-speed trains. The system already has\nrights implications. We documented a case in which Li Xiaolin, a human\nrights lawyer, was put on a blacklist for failing to apologize\n``sincerely'' to a plaintiff in a defamation case. In that case, the\npenalty was exacted in an arbitrary and unaccountable manner:\nauthorities failed to notify him that he had been blacklisted, leaving\nhim no chance to contest his treatment.\nTo what extent the social credit system will evolve, and how it\nwill interact with the police systems of mass surveillance, remains an\nopen question. It is important to note that the social credit system\nand the mass surveillance systems were envisioned as part of the\nChinese government's bigger vision for ``better'' ``social\nmanagement''--meaning, social control.\nIn December 2017, Human Rights Watch documented Xinjiang\nauthorities' compulsory collection of DNA samples, fingerprints, iris\nscans, and blood types of all residents in the region between the ages\nof 12 and 65, in part under the guise of a free public healthcare\nprogram. That campaign significantly expanded authorities' collection\nof biodata beyond previous government efforts in the region, which only\nrequired all passport applicants in Xinjiang to supply biometrics. It\ndid not appear that the government has disclosed to the public or to\nparticipants, the full range of how collected medical information will\nbe used and disseminated or how long it will be stored, and it appears\nthat people were given little information about the program or the\nability to opt out of it. We discovered that a U.S.-based company,\nThermo Fisher Scientific, headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts, had\nsold DNA sequencers to the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau during this\nperiod. After inquiries from Human Rights Watch, members of Congress,\nand the New York Times, the company agreed to stop selling that\nparticular technology in that particular region. However, it remains\nunclear whether it has adopted due diligence policies that might\nprevent such problems in the future.\nMost recently, Human Rights Watch reverse-engineered an app used by\npolice and government officials in Xinjiang that is connected to a\npolice mass surveillance system, called the Integrated Joint Operations\nPlatform (IJOP), which aggregates information about all residents of\nXinjiang under the guise of providing public security. Our research\ninto the app revealed that the authorities consider many ordinary and\nlegal behavior, such as ``not socializing with neighbors,'' ``often\navoiding using the front door,'' using WhatsApp, or simply being\nrelated to someone who has obtained a new phone number, as suspicious.\nThe app then flags such people for interrogation; some of whom are then\nsent to Xinjiang's ``political education'' camps where they are\narbitrarily and indefinitely detained until authorities deemed them to\nhave become sufficiently loyal to the Chinese Communist Party.\nThe consequences of these technologies across China are enormous:\nthe state is now not only able to peer into virtually every aspect of a\nperson's public and private life, but is also clearly using information\ngained that way to reward and punish people outside any discernible\nlegal scheme. It's not just the case that it's now ``suspicious'' if\nyou go out your back door instead of your front door in Xinjiang, it's\nthat the authorities can know that and investigate and punish you for\nit, even though it's legal. You are not only suspicious if you question\nstate policies, your level of suspiciousness is also dependent on who\nyou are related to, who you spend time with.\nLike other human rights violations committed by Chinese\nauthorities, tech-related abuses no longer stay inside China. In recent\nyears major Chinese firms have sold surveillance technology and\nprovided training to other abusive governments; in 2014 we documented\nZTE's sale of telecom surveillance technology to the Ethiopian\ngovernment, which used that equipment to monitor its political\nopponents.\\1\\ iFlytek, one of China's major voice recognition\ncompanies, which works with the Ministry of Public Security in building\na national voice pattern database, is working with universities in the\nU.S.; \\2\\ it is unclear whether that cooperation is subjected to due\ndiligence strategies to ensure that that collaboration is not\ninadvertently contributing to human rights violations. China\nElectronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC), a state-owned defense\nconglomerate behind Xinjiang's IJOP system, has numerous\nsubsidiaries.\\3\\ These subsidiaries in turn have joint ventures and\nresearch and development partnerships abroad. One of CETC's\nsubsidiaries is Hikvision, a major surveillance camera manufacturer\nwhose products are used around the world, including in the U.S.\nrecommendations\nWe now find ourselves confronted with a powerful Chinese government\nwilling to deploy extraordinary resources to deny people inside and\noutside China their human rights.\nHuman Rights Watch appreciates that many congressional\ninterventions on China and human rights have long been bipartisan and\nbicameral, and that in recent years members of Congress have stood on\nprinciple to protest human rights violations even when administrations\nwould not.\nTo combat the Chinese government's expanding use of surveillance\ntechnology in the commission of human rights violations, we urge the\nUnited States to impose appropriate export control mechanisms to deny\nthe Chinese government--and Chinese companies enabling government\nabuses--access to technologies used to violate basic rights, including\nby adding companies to existing export control lists, and imposing\ntargeted sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act against individuals\nlinked to serious violations of human rights. U.S, private companies\nand public universities working in this sector should be encouraged to\nadopt due diligence policies to ensure they are not engaged in or\nenabling serious human rights violations.\nIt is imperative that Congress keep up the pressure on the\nadministration to promote universal human rights; certainly, your\nmultiple inquiries as to the administration's approach to Xinjiang have\nhelped. This is particularly important when it comes to international\ninstitutions that have a role in protecting human rights, including the\nUnited Nations Human Rights Council, which I know can sometimes be\ndifficult for members of Congress to do. It is important for you to\nrecognize that the U.S. withdrawal from that body, in particular, has\nmade it much more difficult to develop international pressure to end to\nthe crisis in Xinjiang, and the Chinese government has moved swiftly to\noccupy this space.\nWe urge the swift adoption of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act,\nwhich I was glad to see recently passed out of this committee, and\nvigorous implementation of the Tibet Policy Act, the Reciprocal Access\nto Tibet Act, and the Hong Kong Policy Act--all three regions are under\nenormous pressure from Beijing and face serious encroachments on human\nrights.\nWhile there is much work for the U.S. to do to limit Chinese\ngovernment and Chinese Communist Party encroachments on human rights in\nthe United States, particularly with respect to realms such as academic\nfreedom, those strategies should place at their core protecting the\nrights of people from China who seek an opportunity to exercise those\nrights--not make assumptions about or limit them as a result of their\nnationality or ethnicity. This is a mistake the U.S. has made in the\npast, and it should not be repeated.\nFinally, the U.S.--and ideally members of this body, today--should\nrecommit their support to independent civil society across China. That\ncommunity is under sustained assault, and it needs sustained attention\nfrom the U.S. government--including both Congress and the executive\nbranch. People from that community paid a terrible price at Tiananmen;\nthey have paid it over the past three decades. Yet they have not\nabandoned the Tiananmen spirit, and neither should the U.S.\n------------------\nNotes\n\\1\\ ZTE did not respond to Human Rights Watch's letter of inquiry.\n\\2\\ iFlytek did not respond to Human Rights Watch's letter of\ninquiry.\n\\3\\ CETC did not respond to Human Rights Watch's letter of inquiry.\nThe Chairman. Thank you very much.\nWe are going to hear now from Christopher Walker, who is\nVice President for Studies and Analysis at the National\nEndowment for Democracy. Prior to joining NED, Mr. Walker was\nVice President for Strategy and Analysis at the Freedom House.\nMr. Walker has also served as an adjunct assistant professor of\ninternational affairs at New York University's Center for\nGlobal Affairs. He has been at the forefront of the discussion\non authoritarian influence on democratic systems, including to\nwhat he has termed ``sharp power.''\nMr. Walker.\nSTATEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER WALKER, VICE PRESIDENT FOR STUDIES AND\nANALYSIS, NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY, WASHINGTON, DC\nMr. Walker. I would like to thank Chairman Risch, Ranking\nMember Menendez, and other esteemed members of the committee\nfor the opportunity of presenting testimony on the impact of\nChina's international engagement on democracy.\nFor many years now, the paramount authorities in Beijing\nhave tightened their grip on Chinese society. At home, the\nChinese Communist Party has taken steps to intensify its\ncontrol of media and free expression and sharpened repression\nmore generally. The authorities have enhanced their ability to\ndo so through the application of modern technologies.\nChina in the post-Tiananmen era has been viewed by external\nobservers largely through an economic development lens. The\ndemocracies' headlong rush into unconditional, rather than\nmeasured and principled, engagement with China has resulted in\nevident problems. The central assumption was that by deeply\nengaging the People's Republic of China and welcoming its\nintegration into the global economic system, its government\nwould be encouraged to move in the direction of meaningful\npolitical reform. But this approach has not turned out the way\nwe anticipated.\nAlthough today China intersects in many ways with the\nglobal system, it has not become more transparent and\naccountable under the CCP's rule. Rather, it has developed\npolicies and practices that can corrode and undermine\ndemocratic standards. Thus, we are at the same time facing\nsystems integration and systems competition.\nFor too long, observers in free societies have viewed these\ntrends with China as divorced from developments from beyond the\nPRC, but this narrow view is misguided and has led to a\ndangerous sense of complacency. Beijing has internationalized\nits authoritarianism in ways that affect us all. On this\nimportant anniversary of the brutal crackdown on Tiananmen\nSquare, we are obliged to reflect on the China that has emerged\nover the past 3 decades and on how the country's leadership is\npursuing its ambitions beyond its country's borders.\nA critical aspect of China's development is the massive\nresources the authorities have invested in modern technologies.\nSuch investments over the years have been central to the\nrepression in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, which is\nfunctioning now as a technology-animated police state. As China\nscholar Samantha Hoffman notes, investment by the Chinese\nauthorities in other parts of China, including in Tibet, over\nan extensive period of time has enabled the building of the\nformidable arsenal of surveillance that today is evident in the\nUyghur region.\nIndeed, today the Uyghur region itself serves as an\nincubator for the testing and development of cutting-edge\ntechnological tools of oppression that are invariably feeding\nback into other parts of the PRC but also having impact beyond\nChina's borders, including in places such as Latin America and\nAfrica.\nApart from the sphere of technology, Beijing has refined\nand scaled up its instruments of influence and, with them, its\nability to manipulate the political landscape in other\ncountries. As the leadership in Beijing has become more\nrepressive domestically, China has grown more ambitious\ninternationally in ways that are anathema to democratic values\nand the rule of law. Such behavior is at direct odds with the\nnotion of China as a responsible stakeholder.\nUnder the direction of the CCP, China has established\nplatforms abroad for educational, cultural, and other forms of\ninfluence within open societies. It has been noted during the\ncourse of the discussion so far that China is sharing\ntechnologies and know-how with other authoritarian regimes,\nwhich is true, Cambodia, Angola, Venezuela, and the like. But I\nwould stress that the wrinkle today that should really concern\nall of us is that China is sharing these technologies in more\nopen societies. We can talk more about that, but this is really\ncritical to the understanding of China's evolution and its\nambitions.\nSo I will just say a brief word about some of this in the\nmedia sphere where China has learned to manage political ideas\nwithin its own borders quite effectively, as my colleagues have\nnoted. They are now bending globalization in a way that\nmanipulates discourse abroad both in wide open democratic\nsocieties but also in authoritarian settings.\nIn Africa, for example, China has intensified its\nengagement especially in the region's media sphere, expanding\nits presence in state-owned media outlets in the region,\nhosting exchange programs, and training for journalists, and\nacting as a supplier for Africa's telecommunications\ninfrastructure. I would note, however, that the Chinese\nGovernment's training of journalists is not what we imagine it\nto be. It is not real journalism education. Instead, the focus\nis on talking up Chinese achievements, big infrastructure\nprojects and the like, and on learning how to report from the\nChinese Government's perspective. Such patterns are also\nevident in Latin America.\nI would note that in the United States in 2015, it was\nreported that China Radio International, which is Beijing's\nstate-run radio network, was operating as a hidden hand behind\na global web of stations on which China's government controls\nmuch of the content.\nThis is in line with the patterns we are seeing in terms of\nChina's engagement around the world. And this is defined by\nopacity and secrecy. So in Panama, just to give a couple of\nother examples, and El Salvador, when these governments\nswitched their diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the PRC,\nkey government, private sector, and civil society actors in\nthose countries were kept in the dark until after official\nannouncements were made.\nIn Argentina, a deal reached, when Cristina Kirchner was in\npower, saw the People's Liberation Army given a 50-year lease\nto build and operate a space observation station with dual-use\ncapabilities in Patagonia. After recent reporting revealed the\nagreement provided the Argentine Government with no mechanisms\nfor oversight or access to the station, Argentina's national\ncongress launched an investigation and is seeking to revisit\nthe agreement. The key issue here is that in none of these\ncases was there a public discussion of these very important\nissues before the deals were cut, and this plays out across\nexamples we see where China is engaged.\nSo what do we do about the challenge? I would say the\nfollowing.\nFirst, I think it is important to emphasize that we have\nentered into what is a global struggle over whose values will\npredominate. On the one hand, we have those of the CCP that\nprivileges state control, censorship, and rule by law. On the\nother hand, we have democratic systems that privilege openness,\nfree expression, and the rule of law. How this contest plays\nout will define the character of the world we live in.\nI think as principal steps to get at this, first, we need\nto address the large knowledge and capacity gap on China that\nexists in so many settings. We need to support journalists,\ncivil society, policy elites so they can handle the burden that\nthey are facing now in their own countries in Africa, Latin\nAmerica, the Balkans, and elsewhere.\nSecond, we need to move beyond transparency. Enhancing\ntransparency is a way of safeguarding democratic societies\nagainst undesirable Chinese party state influences, a necessary\nbut insufficient step.\nThird, we need to prioritize democratic solidarity.\nAnd finally, we need to accelerate learning through\ncooperation with democratic partners.\nThank you for your attention.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Walker follows:]\nPrepared Statement of Mr. Christopher Walker\nI would like to thank Chairman Risch, Ranking Member Menendez, and\nthe other esteemed members of the Committee for the opportunity and\nprivilege of presenting testimony on the critical subject of the impact\nof China's international engagement on democratic institutions,\nprinciples, and ideas.\nFor many years now, the paramount authorities in Beijing have\ntightened their grip on Chinese society.

Such investments\nover the years have been central to the repression in the Xinjiang\nUyghur Autonomous Region, which is functioning now as a technology-\nanimated police state.\\2\\ As China scholar Samantha Hoffman notes,\ninvestment by the Chinese authorities in other parts of China,\nincluding in Tibet, over an extensive period of time has enabled the\nbuilding of the formidable arsenal of surveillance that today is\nevident in the Uyghur Region.\\3\\\nIn an environment without meaningful checks on state power, the\nChinese authorities have wide latitude for testing ever more elaborate\nmethods of censorship and social management. As powerful technologies\nexert greater influence, the U.S. and other democracies are engaged in\ncomplex and difficult debates involving civil society, government, and\nacademia over issues of privacy, surveillance, and security. Such\ndebates, for all practical purposes, do not occur in China, opening up\nan enormous space for systematic abuse of the kind that has taken shape\nin Uyghur Region. As machine learning and other technological advances\naccelerate, the precision with which the Chinese government will be\nable to modernize censorship is bound to grow. Indeed, today the Uyghur\nRegion itself serves as an incubator for the testing and development of\ncutting- edge technological tools of repression that invariably are\nfeeding back into other parts of the PRC, but also having an impact\nbeyond China's borders, including in Latin America and Africa.\\4\\\nApart from the sphere of technology, Beijing has refined and scaled\nup its instruments of influence and, with them, its ability to\nmanipulate the political landscape in other countries. As the\nleadership in Beijing has become more repressive domestically, China\nhas grown more ambitious internationally in ways that are anathema to\ndemocratic values and the rule of law. Such behavior is at direct odds\nwith the notion of China as a ``responsible stakeholder.''\na new era of contestation\nIn this new era of contestation, China has claimed a larger role on\nthe global stage and has sought to promote its own preferred ideas,\nnorms, and approaches to governance. Beijing's unexpected ability to\ncarry out digital censorship, to use economic leverage to mute voices\nin the democracies, and more generally to influence democratic systems\nabroad has created a need for fresh ways of thinking about and dealing\nwith this new situation.\nAs China's leadership has placed greater importance on shaping the\npolitical operating environment overseas, it has spent many of billions\nof dollars over the past decade to shape public opinion and perceptions\naround the world.\nAlthough information is increasingly globalized and internet access\nis spreading, China and other authoritarian states have managed to\nreassert control over the realm of ideas.\\5\\ In China, the state keeps\na firm grip on the media environment, and the authorities in Beijing\nuse digital technologies to press their advantage at home and,\nincreasingly, abroad.\nUnder the direction of the Chinese Communist Party, China has\nestablished platforms abroad for educational, cultural, and other forms\nof influence within open societies. Over time, it has become clearer\nthat such initiatives tend to be ``accompanied by an authoritarian\ndetermination to monopolize ideas, suppress alternative narratives, and\nexploit partner institutions,'' what is now understood as ``sharp\npower,'' \\6\\ an approach to international affairs that typically\ninvolves efforts at censorship and the use of manipulation to degrade\nthe integrity of independent institutions.\\7\\\nThe authorities in Beijing have cultivated economic leverage as a\ntool for getting others to play by their rules. Beijing's approach\nseeks to reduce, neutralize, and preempt any challenges to the CCP\nregime's presentation of itself. Its state-funded research centers,\nmedia outlets, people-to-people exchange programs, and network of\nConfucius Institutes often mimic civil society initiatives that in\ndemocracies function independently of government. Meanwhile, local\npartners and others in democracies are often unaware of the logic that\nunderpins China's foreign policy and how tightly the Chinese\nauthorities control social groups, media, and political discourse at\nhome.\nToday, the corrosive effects of China's influence beyond its\nborders are increasingly apparent in a number of crucial domains,\nincluding publishing, culture, academia, and media--sectors that are\nessential for determining how citizens of democracies understand the\nworld around them. China's influence activities aim to discourage\nchallenges to its preferred self-presentation, as well as to its\nstanding or its policies. Limiting or muting public discussion of\nissues deemed unwelcome by the Chinese party-state is a critical\ncharacteristic of sharp power.\\8\\\nmedia\nHaving learned to manage political ideas within their own\ncountries, authoritarian regimes are now bending globalization to their\nown ends by manipulating discourse abroad, especially in the wide-open\ninformation space afforded to them by the democracies. Massive\ninvestments in overseas media infrastructure play a central role. China\nhas scaled up a multifaceted effort to shape the realm of ideas.\nState dominance over political expression and communication is\nintegral to authoritarian governance. Such control enables the\npromotion of favored narratives across media platforms, as well as\nthrough the words of state officials and surrogates. In an era of\nglobal information saturation and fragmentation, the authorities in\nBeijing understand the ``discourse power'' that can be exercised\nthrough focused and amply funded information initiatives. As the PRC's\nmedia platforms expand and its largest internet firms go global,\nBeijing's ability to curate information in a systematic and selective\nmanner will only grow stronger, especially in places where local media\norganizations are vulnerable.\nOne such place is Africa.\\9\\ There, China has made major\ninvestments in media infrastructure, and Chinese censorship tactics are\nbeing deployed in matters that Beijing deems sensitive. Throughout sub-\nSaharan Africa, Chinese state-media outlets have bureaus with two sets\nof editors: There are African editors on the local payroll, but a group\nof Chinese editors in Beijing vets their decisions, at least regarding\nstories that the PRC feels strongly about. The Chinese government gives\nAfrican journalists ``training'' and brings them to visit China. Real\njournalism education, however, is not the goal. Instead, the focus is\non taking in Chinese achievements (cultural sites, big infrastructure\nprojects) and on learning how to report from the Chinese government's\nperspective.\\10\\\nThis is part of a global pattern that is also visible in Latin\nAmerica. China's president Xi Jinping has said that he wants to bring\nten thousand Latin American politicians, academics, journalists,\nofficials, and former diplomats to China by 2020.\\11\\\nOne example relevant to the United States was reported in November\n2015, when it came to light that China Radio International (CRI),\nBeijing's state-run radio network, was operating as a hidden hand\nbehind a global web of stations on which the Chinese government\ncontrols much of the content. According to a Reuters investigation, 33\nstations in 14 countries ``primarily broadcast content created or\nsupplied by CRI or by media companies it controls in the United States,\nAustralia, and Europe.'' As part of this elaborate Chinese-government\neffort to exploit the open media space, more than a dozen stations\nacross the United States operate as part of the CCP's ``borrowed boat''\napproach, in which existing media outlets in foreign countries are used\nto project China's messages.\\12\\\nThrough its formidable global media apparatus more generally, China\nis spreading messages abroad, using a variety of tools, about\nalternatives to democracy as models of governance, how the media can be\ncontrolled, and value-neutral internationalist positions in debates on\nissues such as internet governance.\nconfucius institutes\nChinese authorities portray the Confucius Institutes as being\nsimilar to the British Council or the Goethe-Institut, both of which\nreceive government funding to give language and culture classes. Yet\nunlike those freestanding organizations, the Confucius Institutes are\nembedded within educational institutions, most of which are committed\nto the type of free intellectual inquiry that is impossible at\nConfucius Institutes themselves.\nMany casual observers of the Confucius Institutes might not realize\nthat the Confucius Institutes' constitution, found on the website of\nHanban (the Chinese arm of the government that directs them), implies\nthat Chinese law applies within the premises of the Institutes.\\13\\\nMoreover, the Confucius Institutes employ staffers who at times have\nsought to block host universities from holding discussions on sensitive\ntopics such as Taiwan or Tibet.\\14\\\nLittle about these institutes is transparent; it is hard to say,\nfor instance, what amount of Chinese government money goes to\nindividual host universities. It is also unclear what level of control\nuniversities have over curricula within the Institutes because the\nagreements between these parties often remain confidential.\\15\\\nincubating and sharing technology toward repressive ends\nBeijing's considerable influence is increasingly evident in the\ndigital space. China and other autocratic regimes have applied the\nonline tools and techniques that they have refined for domestic use\ninternationally as well. As noted at the outset of this statement, many\nof the techniques that are applied abroad are first incubated at the\ndomestic level by the Chinese authorities. Through the online\ncensorship system known as the Great Firewall, Chinese authorities have\nlong been able to manage and restrict what China's people--the world's\nlargest number of internet users inside a single set of national\nborders--can access when they go online. Now the government is\nincreasingly applying machine learning to combine censorship and\nsurveillance into comprehensive social management, a development that\nwill increasingly impact global freedom of expression.\\16\\\nBeijing's paramount aim, it seems, is to exert control over key\ninformation spheres and the tools for manipulating thoughts, images,\nand ideas. Its management model is centralized and unitary.\\17\\ As the\nauthorities in Beijing deepen their artificial intelligence (AI)\ncapacities, including through massive data collection, they are likely\nto apply these technologies to devise ever more precise methods of\nsocial management, including predicting individual behavior and\npotential collective action.\nA recent case in Ecuador suggests some of the potential risks.\nEcuador's negotiation under President Rafael Correa of a Chinese-\nfinanced loan to acquire surveillance equipment and technology to power\nits ECU-911 monitoring system took place in the absence of meaningful\npublic debate, and civil society is only now in a position where it can\nbegin to grapple with the potential ramifications of such an extensive\nsystem that has already been put into place. There is evidence to\nsuggest that the ECU-911 system is being used to monitor civil society\nactivists and critics of the government, much as these systems are used\nin China.\\18\\\nIn China, the companies responsible for developing these\ntechnologies are not only partnering with the state security apparatus,\nbut are intertwining themselves within key institutions in democratic\nsocieties, giving them an increasing stake in the platforms and\nalgorithms that determine speech on a worldwide basis. China's ambition\nto become a global powerhouse in big data, AI, and other emerging\ntechnologies has significant ramifications for democratic governance\nglobally, yet much of civil society involved in the governance of\nemerging technologies has yet to engage on this issue in a meaningful\nway.\\19\\ Democracies have yet to develop a comprehensive response to\nChina's plan to build digital infrastructure across key parts of the\nglobe, creating a ``Digital Silk Road,'' and allowing China immense\npower over the future of the digital world.\nthe corrosive effects of authoritarian capital\nMany emerging and vulnerable democracies face challenges in\ngoverning foreign direct investment, including weak accountability in\npublic spending, opaque corporate governance, poor procurement\noversight, and lax anti-corruption enforcement. These challenges are\neasily exploited by authoritarian regimes intent on using state-\nconnected financial resources for reasons other than development or\nmutual economic benefit, leading to potentially disastrous outcomes for\nopen and democratic governance. When investment and foreign assistance\nis part of a meaningful public discussion involving civil society in\ndeveloping economies, the effect can be to strengthen such essential\nfeatures of democratic governance as citizen voice and participation,\nand transparency and accountability. If the authoritarian-linked firms\nand institutions driving the capital flows ignore or even undermine\nliberal-democratic values and concerns, however, the durability of\ndemocratic governance can suffer, corruption can flourish, and\nauthoritarianism can find fertile ground.\nIn regions such as the Western Balkans where the interests of local\npolitical elites, who retain power by catering to key patronage\nnetworks, overlap with China's high tolerance for corruption, Beijing's\nway of doing business exacerbates existing problems surrounding\ntransparency and accountability.\\20\\ The situation in Central Europe\nand the Balkans, where young, aspiring or vulnerable democracies\npredominate, is also relevant. In countries throughout those regions\nthere are indications that China has sought to utilize various forms of\ncapital inflows, including equity, debt, and aid, to achieve\ngeostrategic aims and divert the region from a trajectory of\nintegration into the community of democratic states. Regional\ninitiatives, such as China's ``16+1'' initiative (now ``17+1'' since\nthe recent addition of Greece to this grouping) to strengthen bilateral\nties with primarily former Eastern Bloc countries, offer Beijing an\neasy alternative to dealing with the EU as a whole.\\21\\\nIn countries where projects under BRI auspices have turned sour,\nits combining of infrastructure financing with geopolitical aims has\nraised doubt and opposition. In December 2017, for instance, the\ngovernment of Sri Lanka admitted its inability to repay the US$8\nbillion that it had borrowed from Chinese firms to build a deepwater\nport at Hambantota, handing the project to Beijing on a 99-year lease\nin an instance of what critics have called ``debt-trap diplomacy.'' In\nother cases, Chinese financing for infrastructure projects under the\nBRI have seen countries take on unsustainable debt levels for projects\nof questionable economic viability. For example, in Montenegro a\nproject financed by China's Export-Import Bank to link the coastal port\nof Bar by road to Serbia has been dubbed ``the highway to nowhere''\nafter the government could not afford to take out further loans to\ncomplete the overruns of the project.\\22\\\nopacity and secrecy as norms\nSuch deals with China tend to be characterized by an essential lack\nof transparency. This opacity allows China to work with partners who\nhave few other options because of their poor credit ratings and\nreputation for corruption, and also, by agreeing to inflate project\ncost, Beijing is able to funnel a portion of its investment to\ninfluential elites in partner governments.\\23\\ Patterns across regions\nand sectors have taken shape that illustrate the extent of the problem.\nSeveral other recent cases have come to light, for instance, which\ndemonstrate how Beijing's preference for working directly and\nexclusively with executive branch elites in its engagement with foreign\ngovernments and how this can have had a corrosive effect on the\nintegrity of institutions and governance more broadly.\nWhen Panama and El Salvador switched diplomatic recognition from\nTaiwan to the People's Republic of China, key government, private\nsector, and civil society actors were kept in the dark until after\nofficial announcements were made. In the case of El Salvador, its\ncongress has launched an effort to review and halt the advancement of\nan accompanying agreement to establish a special economic zone that\nwould comprise 14 percent of the country's territory in strategic areas\nalong the coast and give preferential benefits to Chinese firms.\\24\\\nOnly a few weeks ago, more than a dozen other agreements that the El\nSalvadorian president had reached with China were made public for the\nfirst time, spanning from promoting the Belt and Road Initiative, to\nscientific and technological cooperation, and educational exchange,\namong others. In all of these cases, civil society and policymakers\nhave been forced to play catch up in order to understand the\nimplications of how such agreements may impact their countries and to\nretrofit monitoring and accountability mechanisms.\nIn Argentina, a deal reached with the Cristina Kirchner\nadministration saw the People's Liberation Army given a fifty-year\nlease to build and operate a space observation station with dual-use\ncapabilities in Patagonia. After recent reporting revealed the\nagreement provided the Argentine government with no mechanisms for\noversight or access to the station,\\25\\ Argentina's national congress\nlaunched an investigation and is seeking to revisit the agreement.\\26\\\nIn Africa, agreements on major deals also fit the pattern.\\27\\\nThe pattern of China's engagement that has taken shape globally has\nnot eluded the U.S. In recent years, reports of influence that were\nonce episodic have become more frequent as journalists and other\nobservers have begun to look more closely; the patterns of opacity and\nmanipulation that have characterized China's engagements in other parts\nof the world have come to light here. China's Influence and American\nInterests, a report produced by the Hoover Institution and the Asia\nSociety and released in November 2018 found that ``in certain key ways\nChina is exploiting America's openness in order to advance its aims on\na competitive playing field that is hardly level. For at the same time\nthat China's authoritarian system takes advantage of the openness of\nAmerican society to seek influence, it impedes legitimate efforts by\nAmerican counterpart institutions to engage Chinese society on a\nreciprocal basis.''\nThis report further observed that ``China's influence activities\nhave moved beyond their traditional United Front focus on diaspora\ncommunities to target a far broader range of sectors in Western\nsocieties, ranging from think tanks, universities, and media to state,\nlocal, and national government institutions. China seeks to promote\nviews sympathetic to the Chinese government, policies, society, and\nculture; suppress alternative views; and co-opt key American players to\nsupport China's foreign policy goals and economic interests.'' \\28\\\nacknowledging, and competing in, the emerging contest over values\nGiven China's rapid emergence on the world stage and its more\nvisible authoritarian internationalism, it seems we are approaching an\ninflection point. If anything, the challenge presented by China and\nother ambitious, internationalist autocratic regimes has grown in the\nmost recent period. At the same time, the democracies are only slowly\nwaking up to the fact that they have entered into an era of serious and\nstrategic contestation based on governance models.\nThe conflict over values that has taken shape globally is one\nbetween autocratic regimes, on the one hand, whose animating governance\nprinciples favor state control, management of political expression, and\nprivileging ``rule by law'' over rule of law, versus democratic\nsystems, on the other, whose principles are based on open societies,\nfree and independent expression, and rule of law. In an era of\nglobalization, the struggle over these fundamental values is being\nwaged in every region and across diverse polities. How this battle\nplays out will define the character of the world we live in.\nTo date, much of the response to the China challenge from the\ndemocracies has focused on the trade and military dimensions, both of\nwhich properly deserve attention. But we must deal with the fact that\nmuch of Beijing's activity in recent years may be related to but is\ndistinct from these domains. In order to compete, the U.S. and other\ndemocracies will need to address this gap in the sphere of values. And\nat a fundamental level, any response to this global challenge also\nneeds to consider the essential importance of democratic development in\nChina itself.\ndeveloping a comprehensive response to the china challenge\nGiven its corrosive impact on critical democratic institutions,\nChina's authoritarian internationalism poses both a rule-of-law and a\nnational security challenge. The following are key steps, drawn from\nthe International Forum for Democratic Studies' sharp power report,\nwhich can be taken to address the Beijing's influence efforts:\nAddress the large knowledge and capacity gap on China. Information\nconcerning the Chinese political system and its foreign policy\nstrategies is limited in many of the societies where China is deeply\nengaged. This asymmetry places societies at a distinct strategic\ndisadvantage. There often are few journalists, editors, and policy\nprofessionals who possess a deep understanding of China--the Chinese\nCommunist Party, especially--and can share their knowledge with the\nrest of their societies in a systematic way. Given China's growing\nfootprint in these settings, there is a pressing need to build capacity\nto disseminate independent information about China and its regime.\nCivil society organizations should develop strategies for communicating\nexpert knowledge about China to broader audiences.\nDeepen understanding of authoritarian influence. China's sharp\npower relies in part on disguising state-directed projects as\ncommercial media or grassroots associations, or using local actors as\nconduits for foreign propaganda or tools of foreign manipulation. To\nrespond to these efforts at misdirection, observers need the capacity\nto put them under the spotlight and analyze them in an independent and\ncomprehensive manner.\nMove beyond transparency. Enhancing transparency as a way of\nsafeguarding democratic societies against undesirable Chinese party-\nstate influence is a necessary but insufficient step. Once the nature\nand techniques of authoritarian influence efforts are exposed,\ncountries should build up internal defenses. Authoritarian initiatives\nare directed at cultivating relationships with the political elites,\nthought leaders, and other information gatekeepers of open societies.\nSuch efforts are part of Beijing's larger aim to get inside such\nsystems in order to incentivize cooperation and neutralize criticism of\nthe authoritarian regime. Support for strong, independent civil society\nis essential to ensuring that the citizens of democracies are\nadequately informed to evaluate critically the benefits and risks of\ncloser engagement with Beijing and its surrogates.\nPrioritize democratic solidarity. Beijing and its surrogates are\nexerting pressure on independent institutions within free societies to\nan extent that would not be imaginable during the Cold War. The\nleadership of institutions essential to the functioning of the public\nsphere within democratic societies--publishers, university\nadministrators, media and technology executives, and others--in the\npast did not need to take into account to such a degree the prospect of\nmanipulation or censorship by external authoritarian powers. Today,\nhowever, the exertion of sharp power makes it necessary for them to\nrenew and deepen their commitment to democratic standards and free\npolitical expression. To address this challenge, common standards must\nbe developed, with the aim of reducing these institutions' exposure to\ndivide and conquer dynamics in order to safeguard their integrity over\nthe long term.\nAccelerate learning through cooperation with democratic partners. A\nnumber of countries, Australia especially, have already had extensive\nengagement with China and can serve as an important point of reference\nfor countries whose institutions are at an earlier stage of their\ninteraction with Beijing.\\29\\ Given the complex and multifaceted\ncharacter of Beijing's influence activities, such learning between and\namong democracies is critical for developing responses that are not\nonly effective but consistent with democratic standards.\n------------------\nNotes\n\\1\\ Christopher Walker, ``Authoritarian Regimes are Changing How\nthe World Defines Democracy,'' Washington Post, June, 13 2014.\n\\2\\ Chris Buckley and Paul Mozur, ``How China Uses High-Tech\nSurveillance to Subdue Minorities,'' New York Times, May 22, 2019.``How\nMass Surveillance Works in Xinjiang, China,'' Human Rights Watch, May\n2, 2019.

Well, thank you so much. All three of you\nhave provided a perspective for us and corroborates what a lot\nof us have read from time to time. It is a chilling picture\nthat starts to emerge of what is happening in China as far as\npeople's privacy, as far as the surveillance, and their real\ninability to do anything that the government is not looking\nover their shoulder on.\nMr. Walker, you raised an interesting point. I would like\nyou to expand on that a little bit, if you would, and that is\nthe proliferation of technology to open countries as far as\ntheir use of these technologies to surveil their own people.\nCould you talk about that for a couple minutes?\nMr. Walker. Thank you, Senator.\nThis transcends the technology issue but it is a critically\nimportant part of the discussion.\nSo the focus on what we might call the authoritarian\nfraternity where repressive states deal with repressive states\nis one part of the discussion. But if we think about how the\nrelationship between China and countries such as Ecuador today\nor Argentina or countries in the Balkans is evolving, in Serbia\nwhere there is far deeper engagement with China today than\nthere was, say, 5 or 6 years ago, these are essentially open\nsettings. They have struggles to achieve democratic reform, but\nall of these societies are looking to do so. In each of these\ncases, the privileging of secrecy, the transferring of\ntechnologies, as we have learned in the Ecuadorian case that,\nin fact, can have applications that are used for purposes that\nare not consistent with privacy and the rule of law. This is\nsomething that needs far greater scrutiny.\nAnd my fear is that because the expertise we have available\ntoday either knows China, on the one hand, or some of the\ncountries we are talking about, on the other hand--there is\nwhat I would call a strategic gap in meaningfully addressing\nsome of the issues that countries in Latin America, sub-Saharan\nAfrica are facing.\nSophie mentioned Ethiopia and ZTE. Ethiopia right now has\nthe promise of democratic reform but itself, as I understand,\nhas ZTE, Huawei, and StarTimes as its principal tech and\ncontent providers. So it is solely China that has both the\nability to create choke points for content in that setting and\nalso to manipulate the tech environment.\nThe Chairman. You made reference to rule of law. Very few\ncountries, if any, other than the United States, have the kind\nof laws that provide for privacy of their own citizens. So how\ndoes that play into that? I mean, if they go to a country that\ndoes not have those kind of laws, really there is nothing to\nstop the government from converting themselves into an overseer\nof the population.\nMr. Walker. So I think it is true that in authoritarian\nsettings, the safeguards that one would hope for do not exist\non rule of law, privacy, and other such issues. In some of the\ncountries we have been discussing that are weak democracies or\nvulnerable democracies, they may well have laws on the books\nthat provide such safeguards, but I would suggest that they are\nin greater jeopardy through this deep engagement with China and\nthat this provides a vulnerability that was not really in view\nas recently as 5 or 6 years ago and it is something we are only\ncoming to terms with now.\nThe Chairman. Senator Menendez.\nSenator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nThank you all for your testimony.\nI agree that China's so-called long arm and influence\nabroad is having implications in human rights issues around the\nworld. For example, we recently saw that Amnesty International\nwas denied a lease in New York after a Chinese state-owned\nenterprise was involved. Just a few days ago, more than 1,000\nTwitter accounts associated with Chinese human rights activists\nand defenders were mysteriously shut down. We have seen the\nChinese Government pressure Southeast Asian countries to detain\nand deport activists or ethnic minorities, such as Uyghurs.\nSo the question is, are we equipped to confront these\nglobal human rights challenges that China presents? Are there\nthings that we can better do with our partners, allies, and\nactivists on the ground to tackle this issue across the world?\nI would like to hear, Ms. Richardson, if you have some\nperspectives on that.\nDr. Richardson. Thank you, Senator. It is a broad question.\nMaybe I can give you an example that speaks to your question,\nalso what the chairman was just asking about.\nEarlier this year, we were looking into censorship of\nWeChat, which is a social media platform that is used by\nChinese speakers all over the world, particularly Chinese\nspeaking diaspora communities, including in the U.S. And we\ncame upon an example in which a Canadian member of parliament\nwho is herself of ethnic Chinese descent had been communicating\nwith her own constituents through her WeChat account, and she\nhad posted both on her WeChat account and on her Facebook page\nsome remarks that were sympathetic towards the pro-democracy\nmovement in Hong Kong. And it was not until we contacted her\noffice to point out that the messages that had been posted on\nWeChat, which is of course owned by a large Chinese company,\nhad been censored. We were not able to ascertain who exactly\nhad done that. She and her staff had not been aware of it.\nBut I think it is a very powerful example partly of the\nphenomenon that Chris is talking about, about spaces in\ndemocratic countries that are being exploited partly because\nthey are not being watched very carefully. It is not the habit\nof elected members of bodies in democratic countries to worry\nabout their communications with their own constituents being\ncensored especially by entities in some other country. So I\nthink there is much to be done in the realm of simply being\nvigilant to these threats.\nWe did some work earlier this year about threats to\nacademic freedom outside of China but as a result of Chinese\nGovernment pressure. Every single school that we spoke to\ncertainly has honor codes and codes of conduct that speak to\nissues like cheating and plagiarism. We could not find a single\none that had on its books any particular rules or instructions\nor guidelines to even look for examples of embassies\nthreatening students or demanding that they share information\nwith the nearest consulate.\nSo the problem now is not even so much about changing or\nupdating the laws but being vigilant to these kinds of threats\nand taking steps to guard against them.\nSenator Menendez. Let me ask you, Mr. Walker, in this\nregard, the NED's report on sharp power, a document to how the\nChinese Government is using the space provided by open\nsocieties to infiltrate and spread their propaganda. And the\nlack of reciprocity in U.S.-China relations is evident not only\non trade issues but also when it comes to freedom of\ninformation, movement, and academic freedom.\nDo you think that the Congress should explore further ways\nto enforce reciprocity in U.S.-China relations beyond trade?\nDoes the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act and its implementation\nprovide a model for other areas?\nMr. Walker. So I think the Tibet issue is emblematic of the\nlarger challenge. And I would commend everyone here to a report\nproduced by the Hoover Institution and the Asia Society which\nfocused on this very issue. And it observed that the Chinese\nauthorities systematically deny American institutions access to\nChinese society, whether we talk about educational exchange,\ncultural exchange, media engagement. We know this from both the\nharassment that our independent media faces, as well as our\npublic broadcasters that are seeking to reach Chinese\naudiences. And at the same time, American counterpart\ninstitutions are not afforded the same opportunities.\nI think this is not, in my view, a binary choice between\nsimply denying China access here as a way of responding. I\nthink we need to be creative, and we need to think about ways\nto publicly shine a light on the fact that China is so stingy\nwith access to our institutions. I do not think we have done\nthat enough. That is a first step. That does not cost too much\nto make a point that this is the way their system is operating.\nThis is the way they treat their own people, denying them\naccess to perfectly legitimate conversations about a range of\nissues, corruption, human rights, press freedom. They do not\npermit such freedoms there, and they do not permit it for their\nown people. They do not permit it for democratic institutions.\nI think the first step is to have a much more robust discussion\nto engage on this, and I think that would go a long way towards\nsetting some wheels in motion.\nSenator Menendez. Finally, what should we do about U.S.\ncompanies that are involved in providing equipment and other\nforms of elements of the surveillance that China is using at\nhome and promoting abroad? What should be our policy in that\nregard?\nDr. Richardson. I think at least until such time as we can\ndetermine, or an independent credible entity can determine,\nthat the political education camps in Xinjiang have been\nclosed, I think an end-user ban on selling just about anything\nto any part of the Xinjiang government is appropriate.\nLonger term, the UN has set out guidelines for business and\nhuman rights that require that each company have a due\ndiligence strategy in place to assure that the company does not\nhave policies or practices or is conducting business in ways\nthat contribute to or enable human rights.\nWe have had a lot of conversations in the last couple of\nyears with many different kinds of companies, and while most of\nthem have some form of a corporate social responsibility\npolicy, when you ask for an actual due diligence strategy, what\nsteps is that company taking to see who it is selling to, what\nit is selling, most of them do not have it.\nAnd it is worth pointing out that Thermo Fisher had all the\nright export licenses to sell what it did. We were never\ncontesting that. But the problem with a lot of current export\ncontrols is that they have not kept up with what technology is\nin demand by Chinese authorities for abusive purposes. So while\nit is still illegal, as a result of the Tiananmen sanctions, to\nsell, for example, handcuffs to the Public Security Bureau, it\nis perfectly legal to sell DNA sequencers. So there are big\ngaps I think in the export controls that can and should be\nclosed.\nSenator Menendez. Thank you.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nThe Chairman. Thank you.\nSenator Gardner.\nSenator Gardner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very\nmuch for holding this incredibly important hearing.\nAnd thank you to the witnesses for your testimony today.\nI was proud to work with you, Mr. Chairman, the ranking\nmember, and many members of the committee on Senate Resolution\n221 to remember the tragic events at Tiananmen Square 30 years\nago, and I hope this resolution is something that we can pass\nout of the Senate as quickly as possible in recognition of\nthat. And I urge all my colleagues to support it. We have to,\nas a Senate, as a country, continue to demand that the\nCommunist Party of China account for this activity and respect\nthe basic human rights of the Chinese people. We should empower\npeople around the globe to know the truth of Tiananmen.\nTiananmen was not a fake. It was not a fake moon landing. It\nwas not a figment. It was real. People were killed by an\nauthoritarian state. We must continue to share the truth and\nnot to allow crime against humanity to be censored away.\nJust a couple days ago, hundreds of Chinese dissident\nvoices had their accounts suspended on Twitter. You can see the\nfirewalls that have been put in place, the banishing of chat\ngroups and discussion groups and websites that just seem to\nundergo routine maintenance right around the time of the 30th\nanniversary of Tiananmen Square.\nAs evident from the abuses in Xinjiang and Tibet, China's\nhuman rights record has only worsened in the last 30 years.\nThis is why the administration and Congress must now act to\nsend a strong message to Beijing that the United States will\nnot abide by such abuses. The Gardner-Markey Asia Reassurance\nInitiative, signed into law on December 31st, authorizes the\nadministration to impose sanctions against any individual or\nentity that, quote, violates human rights or religious freedoms\nor engages in censorship activities. We should take up this\nlanguage immediately.\nSection 409(a)(2) of ARIA also authorizes funds\nspecifically to promote democracy, the rule of law, and human\nrights in the People's Republic of China.\nI want to follow up on what Senator Menendez had talked\nabout. The Wall Street Journal just reported not too long ago\nthat many U.S. companies continue to do business in Xinjiang\nand perhaps are either wittingly or unwittingly complicit in\nthe violations that are taking place, the violations of human\nrights that are taking place there.\nBut we have even more challenges because as Beijing\nencourages investment in Xinjiang to draw jobs there, there are\nsubcontractors who are very much a part of the supply chain\nthat are going to Western companies headquartered here that are\nparticipating in human rights violations.\nWe know that China is going to try to interfere in Taiwan's\nelection coming up over the next several months.\nWe know that several pension funds in the United States are\ninvolved and make investments in one of the largest\nsurveillance companies in China that is actively being used to\nviolate human rights of Uyghurs and beyond.\nWe have authorized a lot of legislation, a lot of funding\nto help address this and meet this challenge.\nI would love to hear from you. How do we make sure that we\nbest tailor the funds that we have authorized to address these\nhuman rights violations and what we can do to support human\nrights defenders in China? I would just open that up to any of\nyou.\nMr. Xiao. Senator, thank you for starting to say we should\ncontinue to tell the world about the truths of Tiananmen. We\nknow that in China that truth has been repressed. And through\nmy own work, I watch--my China Digital Times team--watch the\nChinese Internet very closely. Over the past 8 years, every\nyear, that by the time near June 4th and the last 3 weeks,\nthere is always intensified suppression of the online content\nabout Tiananmen. Chinese do speak out, but they are being\nsuppressed.\nI give you the examples, just examples. Over 264 words are\nblocked by the Sina Weibo search engine. By the way, Sina Weibo\nis like China's equal on Twitter, 600 million users. And also\non the Wall Street index, it is the company here. Look at what\nkind of words are being blocked. Yes, of course, ``64,''\n``89,'' ``8x8,'' ``65-1,'' or ``98,'' not only ``June 4th'' but\n``May 35th'' to translate to June 4th. The Chinese are using\nthose words to create conversations, but they are being stopped\nby the censor and deleted. There are more, ``anniversary,''\n``pay respect,'' ``mourn,'' ``candle,'' ``public square.'' And\nhow about this? Near the date to June 4th, there will be a ban\nof the word ``today'' or ``that day.'' Why? Because once you\nsearch that ``today,'' most of the discussion is about June\n4th. The censors are not quick enough to delete them. So they\njust ban the search words. And ``move'' and ``fire'' and there\nis a Chinese character that looks like a tank that means point.\nSo anybody say ``point, point, point,'' that means ``tank,\ntank, tank.'' That is the code word that has been banned.\nSo it is not that Chinese people are just born to be\ncreative to speaking those things. It is because they have a\nmotivation to speak, but the technology and the censorship and\nthe repression is much harder to suppress those voices.\nNow, a government like that cannot face the truth and\naccountability to Tiananmen, how can the world trust its myth\nof a peaceful rise. No. You treat the Chinese people this way\nwhen you are getting powerful. That oppression is not going to\nstop by the Chinese border. And this is what we are facing.\nAnd you are asking how do we appropriate funds effectively.\nI will start from freedom of expression, free flow of\ninformation on the Internet. Yes, the Chinese state is\npowerful. I keep on saying that, but it is also fragile and\ninsecure. Simply when you meet a Chinese leader, if they are so\npowerful, why do they not just take off, stop the Great\nFirewall just for 6 months? Try it. Let the information flow.\nLet the Chinese people access all the other content on the\nInternet for just 6 months. Why do you not take down the Great\nFirewall? The regime cannot afford it. It is that fragile, and\nthat is why that is so brutal.\nSenator Gardner. Thank you for sharing that Tiananmen\ntruth.\nThe Chairman. Thank you so much.\nSenator Shaheen.\nSenator Shaheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd thank you to each of our witnesses for being here\ntoday.\nLast February, a number of us journeyed to the Munich\nSecurity Conference. One of the meetings that we had was with\nthe prime minister of Greece. And one question that we had for\nhim was about Greece's acceptance of support from China for the\nPort of Piraeus. And one of his responses was very memorable to\nthat. He said I asked for help from the European Bank, and I\nwas denied. I asked for help from the United States, and I was\ndenied. The Chinese were willing to help me.\nSo can any of you speak to the ways in which China uses its\neconomic leverage to spread its political system and whether we\nare doing enough in the United States to respond to that? Mr.\nWalker, do you want to begin?\nMr. Walker. Thank you, Senator.\nI think that example is illustrative of a much larger\nchallenge. You spoke in a strategic port context, but I think\none of the things we have not touched on yet, which is so\ncritical, is that China is investing enormous resources into\npeople-to-people exchanges, into media, into educational\ninitiatives. And there was a time when observers of these\nthings, going back not that long ago, were quite dismissive of\nthese issues. But now it is impossible to travel to Africa, to\nLatin America, to Central Europe and not to meet someone who\nhas got this sort of opportunity. And what they say is, look,\nwe are getting these opportunities. They are paying our way,\nand we are not getting these opportunities from our democratic\npartners, including the U.S.\nAnd I think if we are serious about competing and meeting\nthe values challenge, we have to be more deeply engaged across\nall of these areas. It is something we have to come to terms\nwith.\nDr. Richardson. Thanks, Senator, for the question.\nI will just have one other example which is that it used to\nbe in our universe a fairly easy thing to do to ask the\nEuropean Union to speak with one voice about human rights\nissues in China. That has become exponentially more difficult\nin recent years largely as a result of Chinese financial\ndevelopments in Southern Europe and the rise of institutions\nlike the 16 plus 1. It is clearly there to try to split EU\nsolidarity. I think we see that across not just blocs like the\nEU but even within individual governments that have\nhistorically been reasonably strong on these issues where\npeople within those governments are clearly feeling the\npressure between possibly losing out on a trade deal and taking\na principled position. Often what we try to point out is that\nthey can do both. Typically they can get away with doing both.\nBut increasingly people within governments are convinced that\nthey cannot and they have stopped trying. And that is a serious\nchallenge for human rights advocacy.\nSenator Shaheen. And so are we doing enough in the United\nStates to counter that economic commitment that China is making\nto many of these countries?\nMr. Walker. So I think fundamentally no. But it goes\nbeyond, in my view, the economic question. I think there has\nbeen a misapprehension over the last generation that China was\npursuing its interests solely on the basis of economics, and\nChina's engagement in all the settings we look at comes without\nother features, including politics and values. This was another\nmisapprehension. The values that come with China's engagement\naims to get partners to set aside certain subjects, sideline\ncivil society participation, and otherwise, in one way or\nanother, to censor discussion on certain issues of importance\nto the CCP. And this is critically important because this\ncensorship starts to grow roots, it becomes a larger problem.\nSophie alluded to this idea of divide and conquer that has\nemerged within the context of the 16 plus 1 in Central Europe\nwhich is now the 17 plus 1 because Greece has joined that set\nof countries. China uses this essentially as a bilateral\ninitiative to operate with the 17 countries. This is happening\nboth at the state level as well as within states where our\nuniversities and cultural institutions and media enterprises\nare finding is that they too can be picked off when they are\nengaging with China.\nAnd so we need to cultivate the capacity that was not\nnecessary even a decade ago, which is ways to create common\nstandards and greater solidarity among our democratic\ninstitutions because if they are faced with the China party\nstate on their own, they are going to have a really hard time.\nSenator Shaheen. My next question I think is--and I only\nhave a little bit of time left, but for you Mr. Xiao. Certainly\nwe read reports in the United States about efforts on the part\nof Chinese who are trying to speak out against the repression\nthat is going on in China. One of the things that we have seen\nreports on in the last decade or so has been an effort in China\nto respond to schools that are collapsing because of shoddy\nconstruction and children being killed, to the environmental\nconcerns that the Chinese people have, to health issues that\nare there. Is the surveillance state also squashing those\nmovements as well?\nMr. Xiao. If they are independent movements from the civil\nsociety and pressing the government and giving real pressure,\nthen yes.\nAt the same time, the technology development in China also\ndoes services, also make the economy growing, also make\npeople's lives smoother. And the government provides better\nservices really as long as they do not challenge the one-party\ndictatorship. That is the part that they will put a foot on.\nSo on the issue of whether Chinese people see whether there\nis privacy that should be protected or whether the technologies\nshould be implemented in a society, the problem is there is no\npublic discussion. It would not allow it.\nFor example, the social credit system everybody is talking\nabout. We know how Orwellian this can be. But right now, they\nhave not quite gotten there. They have not connected to the\ncentral database facial recognition and all of these together\nyet, but it is on its way. But the idea has been started from\neven 2004, as early as that. As soon as they see they want to\nintroduce it in the western America, for example, the credit\nsystem from financial transactions, immediately the government\nsee they can expand that to the social area, and that becomes\nan entirely different issue. And then as China does many\nthings, they have a general policy goal, but then they let the\nlocal governments do the experiment, pilots, to experiment how\nthose things will play out, and they will pick what works or\nnot and then expand.\nSo there is one county in 2004 in Jiangsu Province. That\nparty secretary went ahead to have the social credit system\nwithin his county, put credits on everybody, on the ordinary\npeople. If they have a petition to the government, that is a\nnegative credit. If they do something, disobey the government\nregulation, that is a social credit. And that experiment was\nreported in China by the Chinese media, and it generated a huge\ncontroversy. And there was a lot of criticism and discussion at\nthe time because the Chinese media at that time had a little\nroom. And the public discussion is no different than what we\nsee now. Hey, this is violating people's rights, and this is\ntoo much power for the government. Because at the time, it was\na local government doing the experiment, the people would just\ntake advantage and say, hey, it is just the local government\nthat went too far.\nBut that discussion was being censored later on. For a\ncouple years, it was there in official media, but then now it\nhas disappeared. Nobody says negative things about the social\ncredit system anymore. And that local government has continued\nexperimenting on social credit. They may modify it. They may\nrevise. But the experiment continues.\nNow there are over 40 pilot projects and expanding, but the\npublic discussions on those issues, zero. And that is what is\nhappening in China.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator Shaheen.\nSenator Barrasso.\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nThe Chairman. John, just a second. Before you start, for\nthose of you who see us coming and going, I want to explain\nthat for a minute. The leadership recently scheduled four votes\nover the top of this meeting. But because of the importance of\nthis particular issue, we decided not to put the meeting off.\nWe are going to continue on. So we are going to have to step\nout and vote from time to time, but various members will\npreside.\nSo, Senator Barrasso, I am going to go vote and Senator\nRomney you can chair, if you would.\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nThis weeks marks the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen\nSquare massacre. People around the world continue to remember.\nOn June 4th, 1989, the Government of China sent tanks into\nTiananmen Square to violently suppress and forcibly disperse\npeaceful demonstrators. The Chinese Government's infantry\ntroops opened fire on students and on activists who were\nstanding up for their fundamental freedoms. The horrible events\nresulted in the death and injury of hundreds of courageous\nChinese citizens who were killed, tortured, and imprisoned due\nto their participation in a peaceful democracy movement in\nTiananmen Square.\nThe Chinese authorities to this day continue to block and\ncensor public discussions and events marking the anniversary of\nTiananmen Square.\nBut despite those efforts, the world has not forgotten. You\ngo to the front page of the Wall Street Journal today and here\nit is. Hong Kong remembers Tiananmen Square victims 30 years\non. You go to the front page of the New York Times today with a\npicture of the crowds in the streets. A perilous anniversary.\nThousands gather Tuesday in Hong Kong on the 30th anniversary\nof the crackdown of Tiananmen Square in Beijing. You go to the\nFinancial Times, front page picture of the candles lit and\nheld. Hong Kong pays tribute to Tiananmen Square.\nSo the world has not, nor will it ever forget. We will\nalways remember. We have not forgotten the courage, the pain,\nthe brutality of the Government of China that it imposed. In\nfact, those who suffered and died, I think, inspired future\ngenerations to proudly demand freedom and democracy across the\nglobe, which is why I am happy that the three of you are here\ntoday speaking out.\nThe United States has a long record of championing liberty\nand freedom around the globe. We must continue to support\nindividuals who are demanding freedom of speech, freedom of\nassembly, freedom of religion. And the harassment, detention,\nand imprisonment of Chinese citizens exercising their rights\ncontinues today, and we will continue to speak out.\nSo the question to the three of you is what is the most\neffective approach in your minds for us to engage the\nGovernment of China on human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nDr. Richardson. Thank you, Senator, both for the lovely\nremembrance and the question.\nThis is not a time in history when the Chinese Government\nis eager to have an honest conversation about human rights\nbecause it knows it does not have a good story to tell. And we\nare certainly aware that many governments, including the U.S.,\ncontinue to try to have that conversation, but frankly, I think\nthose discussions veer on the perverse if not the\ncounterproductive because often the Chinese Government will\ntake what is said to it by another government about human\nrights issues and twist it or misreport it. And I think that\ncan be very discouraging for people across the country to see\nif, in fact, they are able to know about it at all.\nI think there is much to be said at this point in time for\ngovernments pursuing, for example, things like shadow human\nrights dialogues with independent activists. There are many\npeople standing in Washington right now who would be incredible\nto have debates with about the trajectory for the rule of law\nin China, how to deal with certain kinds of social issues, how\nto deal with press freedom. And I think for governments to\nengage those people at a level and with a degree of recognition\nthat might normally be reserved only for another government, I\nthink, does a couple of different things. First, it empowers\nthat community and gives it the recognition it deserves. And I\nthink arguably most important, it sends a message to Beijing\nthat those are not the only actors to have these conversations\nwith.\nSenator Barrasso. Anyone else want to add?\nMr. Xiao. Yes. To answer the question of how to best\nempower the Chinese people who are fighting against the\ncommunist regime, let us learn from our enemy. President Xi\nJinping this February had an important meeting to his cadre. It\nis about preventing potential risks, severe risks. And in that\nspeech, some of it made public, he highlighted two things that\nhe worried about as risks: one, Internet; two, youth. He is\nafraid that a new generation of Chinese youth are having\ndifferent value systems that he would not like these people to\nhave. He has his fears, but his fears should be our advantages.\nHis dream of a China dream, that empire dream, repressing\nthe Chinese people and putting surveillance cameras everywhere\nthat the Chinese Communist Party can last for another 100 years\nis a nightmare for the Chinese citizens. It is a nightmare for\nthe entire world. Everybody values freedom. So to go against\nthat is the right way.\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nSenator Romney [presiding]. Thank you.\nSenator Markey.\nSenator Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much.\nThank you all for your work. Mr. Xiao, we salute your\npersonal commitment to stand up for human rights after the\nTiananmen Square massacre. This anniversary really gets focused\non in America maybe not as often as it should on these human\nrights abuses.\nMs. Richardson, we appreciate the reporting by Human Rights\nWatch on China's high tech surveillance efforts against the\nUyghur and other communities. Last month, the New York Times\ndescribed how Beijing is exporting its mass surveillance model\nto other governments. And a Rohingya human rights activist told\nthe East Asia Subcommittee in April that it was worried that\nChina could export this surveillance technology to Burma to\nfurther repress the Rohingya.\nI wrote a letter to Secretary Pompeo asking him to clarify\nthe administration's actions in terms of countering China's\nactions. As we wait for a response, I would like to ask you,\nwhat do you think the administration should do as China exports\nsurveillance technology and surveillance training to other\ncountries?\n[The information referred to is located at the end of\nhearing.]\nDr. Richardson. Thank you, Senator, for the question.\nI think at the absolute top of the to-do list is making\nsure that U.S. companies are not in any way engaged in or\nsupporting any kind of censorship itself.\nIt may be of interest to you that I think about 2 weeks\nago, it was reported that the City of Mandalay was actually\ncontemplating partnering with a Chinese company to build a\nsmart cities network in that particular area. That is a term\nthat is used to describe a very comprehensive surveillance\narchitecture in particular areas. Often it is presented as\nbeing in service of public safety, but it allows for enormous\nsurveillance.\nSenator Markey. Mr. Xiao, what would you want the United\nStates to be doing?\nMr. Xiao. First of all, now we are starting to really need\nto have a very clear eye on what China's--those trade practices\nare, both domestically and internationally. It is just a\npolitical project. It is not just about free trade. Even they\nare under the disguise of private companies, but the state has\nwhat they call a strategic goal for national willingness or\nnational will. And that strategic goal, grand strategic goal,\nwill translate into subsidizing some of those strategically\nimportant private companies to go to the One Belt and One Road,\nto the other countries developing certain technologies, build\nup certain trade relations, and taking advantage of open\nsociety that the rule of law or the diversity of society and\nthe free trade and all of that.\nSenator Markey. We are kind of time limited. Thank you and\nthank you for the insight. We very strongly received your\nmessage here.\nThe New York Times suggested U.S. officials have been\nshelving sanctions against Chinese officials responsible for\nabuses against the Uyghurs out of concern that punitive\nmeasures will undermine trade talks. If true, what message does\nour inaction send not only to the estimated 3 million detainees\naround the world but also to the Chinese Government and\ninternational community about the commitment that we have to\nprotecting human rights in China?\nDr. Richardson. Senator Markey, I do not know how many more\ntimes we can say to the administration we are waiting to see\nGlobal Magnitsky sanctions in response to the gross human\nrights violations taking place in Xinjiang. I literally do not\nknow what else the administration is waiting for.\nSenator Markey. Mr. Walker.\nMr. Walker. I do not know if I have anything to add to\nthat.\nSenator Markey. Mr. Xiao, what is the impact in China of\nthe administration's policy?\nMr. Xiao. On what? I am sorry.\nSenator Markey. What is the impact of this policy of the\nUnited States to kind of turn a blind eye.\nMr. Xiao. The trade war?\nSenator Markey. Yes.\nMr. Xiao. It is, of course, a huge issue, and the\nauthorities are also using it to fan the nationalism. And with\nthe repression and the censorship on the Internet and the\nChinese media, you can only hear one side of voices. My team\nhas been really working hard to go through the deleted\ncontents, the censored materials to listen to the other voices\nthat Chinese people looking at trade war. There are. There are\nliberal voices. There are more clear eyes. They are the ones\nwho believe that letting the Chinese Government to follow those\nrules, to letting the foreign companies in to compete maybe is\nbad for the government, for the state enterprises, but it is\ngood for people. It is good for consumers as a matter of fact.\nSenator Markey. So thank you.\nThere is a Dickensian quality to all of these technologies.\nWe invented them. Facial recognition, Internet, all of it. It\ncan degrade. It can debase. It can enable. We as the inventor\nof these technologies cannot turn a blind eye to the degrading,\nto the debasing of cultures using our technologies. Thank you.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nSenator Gardner [presiding]. Thank you, Senator Markey.\nSenator Coons.\nSenator Coons. Thank you. I would like to thank both\nChairman Risch and Ranking Member Menendez for holding this\nimportant hearing today on the 30th anniversary of the\nTiananmen Square massacre.\nMr. Xiao and Dr. Richardson, Mr. Walker, thank you for\ntaking time to speak with us today about human rights and in\nparticular about China's human rights record.\nSenator Tillis and I as the co-chairs of the Senate Human\nRights Caucus yesterday issued a statement honoring and\nremembering the Chinese students who raised their voices to\ncall for freedom 30 years ago. Like most of us, I remember the\nhorror I felt watching that brutal government crackdown, as\nwell as the inspiration I felt of the lone, anonymous man\nstanding courageously in the path of a column of tanks. His\nbrave act is an important reminder to all of us that all humans\nstruggle for a basic measure of dignity and freedom.\nSo it is deeply disappointing the Chinese Government\nrefuses to acknowledge what happened 30 years ago. The fact the\ngovernment is working diligently in China to erase all mention\nof what happened in Tiananmen Square makes it all the more\nimportant for those of us blessed with freedom and the right to\nspeak freely to do so.\nIt is also a reminder that there are many in China who\nbelieve in the universal values of liberty and freedom. We have\na disagreement not with the Chinese people but with the\nauthoritarianism and the Chinese Communist Party. Tiananmen is\nan important reminder. Many Chinese still want and hope to work\nfor a transparent and accountable government, and not all\nChinese believe the propaganda they hear frequently. And we in\nthe United States should find ways to lift up these brave\nvoices.\nI found particularly compelling Senator Menendez's opening\nin which he reminded us that it is the power of our example as\na nation rather than the example of our power that has built a\nglobal network of values-based alliances. And whether it is in\nSudan where protesters who were peaceful were mowed down by\ntheir army just in the last few days or whether it is 30 years\nago on the square at Tiananmen, we need to stand up for human\nrights.\nDr. Richardson, if I might. You have had a number of my\ncolleagues question you about the administration and their sort\nof inconsistency. Your testimony underscored the importance of\nhaving Congress keep up the pressure on our administration to\npromote universal human rights and to not be selective. I\napplaud Secretary Pompeo for issuing a strong statement about\nTiananmen Square, but remain concerned the administration's\nhighly selective failing to speak out on human rights abuses in\nNorth Korea or in Saudi Arabia, for example.\nHow much of our credibility, Dr. Richardson, depends on\nbeing consistent as a nation when we speak on human rights, and\nwhat happens to our credibility when we are selective, when we\nonly condemn human rights abuses in a few countries and,\nobviously and frequently, overlook them or ignore them in other\ncountries?\nDr. Richardson. Thanks, Senator, for the question.\nI mean, clearly being consistent on human rights is\nessential. If you are selective about it, then you are leaving\nyourself vulnerable to criticisms that you only care about\nthese issues in one place for political reasons rather than for\nprincipled ones. And it undermines the idea that human rights\nare indeed universal.\nI think given the scope of my particular work where the\nU.S.'s absence recently has been most acutely felt has been at\nthe United Nations Human Rights Council where the U.S.'s\nwithdrawal has made it exponentially more difficult to advance\nany steps towards fact finding or accountability or a longer-\nterm strategy----\nSenator Coons. I will just say one of the more inspiring\naspects of my opportunity to serve alongside Senator John\nMcCain was hearing him articulate the way in which human rights\nis not just one of many interests, it is sort of the principal\ninterest that the United States has to continue to consistently\nadvance around the world. It is what defines us, our\nwillingness to advocate for human rights even when it is not in\nour narrow or short-term economic or strategic interest.\nMr. Walker, I found your comments about the ways in which\nthe technology of control and authoritarianism is now being\nexported by China globally to reinforce things I have seen\nparticularly in sub-Saharan Africa. One of my concerns is that\nthe ways in which the repression of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang is\nplaying out, as you testified in detail, is now going to be\nreplicated in other countries around the world fairly quickly.\nOne of my concerns is that we have dedicated ourselves to\ndeploying the mechanics of elections to middle income and to\nlower income countries and that there is a concerning, now,\npossibility of real overlap between the biometric data capture\nin order to validate elections and the machinery of repression\nthat you described.\nHow can we come up with standards of conduct for\ngovernments for this century in order to help their citizens\nhave confidence that, by participating in what seems to be a\npublic health screening or by participating in voting, they are\nnot in fact handing over their own personally identifying\ninformation in a way that makes it easier to track and repress\nthem?\nMr. Walker. So it is a terrific question, Senator, and it\nis not an easy one to answer.\nI would say it speaks to the need for democratic solidarity\nat a very basic level. I believe that all the democracies are\nin this together, and to the extent you have democracies in\nsub-Saharan Africa or Latin America, which are now adopting the\ntechnologies from China but also the norms that come around\nthem, it is terribly important that we understand this. It is\nnot just the hardware. But when China comes in, they come with\nknow-how and a certain set of standards and norms that in my\nview are anathema to democratic and human rights norms.\nThis is going to take a lot of work because in countries\nthat have deep institutional roots and therefore, at least to\nsome degree, more of an ability to respond to precisely the\nsort of issue you touched on, they will be better positioned,\nbut not entirely positioned, as we learned in our own country\nwith the vulnerabilities of our election system, which is true\nin all democracies now. I think this is going to speak to the\nneed for new models of cooperation that would go across\ndisciplines, and this is something that is terribly important.\nIt cannot just be regional specialists. You need technologists.\nYou need data scientists. You need people who understand\nprivacy law and rules. And this is an area of work we are going\nto have to get better at in the coming period.\nSenator Coons. I will say this. In visits to the Baltic\nStates and to Eastern European states that have faced\npersistent and broad-scale interference in their media and\ncommunication systems and their electoral systems from Russia,\nthere is a sharing among democracies of the means of resisting\nundue influence. I think we need to rapidly develop and deploy\nsomething comparable.\nYour comment on Chinese training of journalists in Africa\nwas a reminder that we are far into what is now a competition,\nnot a clash of civilizations, Mr. Xiao, as you correctly\npointed out, but a clash of competing visions of the role of\nthe individual with regard to the state and society.\nI am well over my time, and we have another vote called.\nMr. Xiao, I will simply say I found your comments inspiring. I\nwould love to give you a minute, if I might, to simply share\nwith us--given that I am confident that young Chinese in\nmainland PRC continue to yearn for the same things as those a\ngeneration ago did in Tiananmen Square, what can we do here in\nthe United States to help them?\nMr. Xiao. Before I answer that question, I want to\nrespond--not respond--commenting on your----\nSenator Gardner. If you could be brief with your responses.\nI know we have got limited time and a vote coming on. Thank\nyou.\nMr. Xiao. Sure, okay.\nThe United States should put many, many pro-democracy human\nrights programs, including the educational area, that have an\nagenda to engage the Chinese youth to a more open world. Today\nmany young Chinese, even they come to the United States, they\nlive in their Chinese social media world. They are still not so\nopen to the life here and the political system and values here.\nSo there is much more a program can do even to the Chinese\nstudents and overseas Chinese around the world studying in this\ncountry.\nSenator Gardner. Thank you, Mr. Xiao.\nSenator Kaine.\nSenator Kaine. Thank you and thank you to the witnesses.\nI know you have testified and there have been questions\nasked about the Uyghur situation, but I just want to return to\nit. The reporting that we have had for the last couple of years\nabout this sort of mass suppression of Uyghurs in northwest\nChina has just been chilling. The involvement of some American\ncompanies in helping provide China with technology has been\nvery, very disturbing. And it strikes me that if Uyghurs were\nChristians and the Chinese Government was placing officials in\nthe homes of Christians to monitor whether they engaged in\nreligious observances or not, in the United States we would be\nabsolutely taking to the streets about this. I think the fact\nthat they are Muslims and the fact that the information that we\nget is a little bit harder to access for some has maybe\nsuppressed the degree of outrage among the American public.\nBut I have worked on legislation with colleagues to get\nmore reporting from the State Department, letters to the\nadministration to ask them to do more.\nWhat might we do that would better raise in the American\npublic's conscience the just shocking violations of these\npeople's basic human rights? I mean, a million-plus in\nconcentration/reeducation camps. But again, the placing of\nofficials in people's homes to monitor their religious\nobservances is just unheard of. What can we do to spread the\nword more and generate global outrage about what is happening?\nMr. Walker. So maybe just a brief observation. I think the\nreporting that has been done in papers like the New York Times\nand the Wall Street Journal, which has really been phenomenal\nbringing to light in graphic detail the way in which this, as I\ncalled it, technology-animated police state has emerged in\nXinjiang, is critically important.\nI think the next step is for all of us to understand that\nwhat is happening there cannot be seen in a vacuum. What is\nhappening there has been happening in other parts of China\nalready and has informed development in the Uyghur region, and\nit is informing developments beyond China now in all the ways\nwe have been discussing. And that is central to this, that this\nis now I think relevant for all of us who value privacy, who\nvalue human rights, that the surveillance mechanisms under\nwhich the Uyghurs are suffering is in the view of the\nleadership in Beijing are something that can be applied\nelsewhere. And that should really chill all of us.\nSenator Kaine. I am going to ask a second question, and I\nam going to finish on time because I have to vote on this vote.\nAnd the second question is this. So give us some advice.\nHere is something that we hear often from the administration if\nwe raise human rights issues with respect to Saudi Arabia, for\nexample. They will say, well, look, if we insist on tough human\nrights standards, they will just go to China or Russia because\nChina and Russia will do all kinds of business with them\nwithout any human rights standards. That argument always makes\nme furious. I want to be true to our values. I do not care. I\nhate dictators of the right, left, or whatever, or the cults of\npersonality, and I think we ought to stand for something\ndifferent.\nBut how do you respond to that argument when somebody makes\nthe argument that, hey, there are a lot of countries around the\nworld that are perfectly willing to do all kinds of business\nwith you with no human rights expectations? Why should the U.S.\nstill insist on high human rights standards?\nDr. Richardson. Well, Senator Kaine, thanks for the\nquestion.\nI have been at Human Rights Watch since 2006, and I have\nheard that argument from just about every government and every\nadministration we have worked with since then in the U.S. and\nbeyond. Nobody wants to be in the lead irking the Chinese. It\nsort of depends on who is in the hot seat that particular day.\nI think governments are at a point now, though, where there\nis a much greater recognition of the threat the Chinese\nGovernment presents not just inside but outside China. And the\nquestion now is how to channel, I think, an agreement that\nthere is not going to be convergence on established\ninternational norms to translate that into forceful policies\nthat prioritize, among other things, human rights.\nI would tweak your point of comparison a little bit. We\nfound ourselves saying a lot if any other government in the\nworld was locking up a million Muslims simply on the basis of\ntheir identity, let us imagine what the global response would\nlook like and aspire to that.\nSenator Kaine. You got a good point.\nDr. Richardson. Very quickly, two things I can think of off\nthe top of my head that this committee and others can do.\nFirst of all, I think the Uyghur diaspora community across\nthe U.S. is in desperate need of recognition, attention,\nsupport, and that ranges everywhere from trauma counseling to\ndatabases of missing family members, simply a recognition of\ntheir problems.\nThe other is really to reach out to your counterparts in\nother governments to find commonality. We cannot find many\ngovernments that disagree that the situation in Xinjiang is\nincredibly serious and problematic. It is very hard to get\nanybody to step up and make the first move in pushing for any\nsort of joint response that presumably would put greater\npressure on China.\nThe Chairman [presiding]. Thank you. I appreciate those\nimportant questions. I am going to do a follow-up on that when\nI get a chance. But now, Senator Romney, you are up.\nSenator Romney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I very much\nappreciate the committee and the chairman for hosting this\nhearing. It is such an important topic. And I apologize just as\na Member of the Senate for the fact that we keep on emptying\nthe room up here, but there are votes going on. So we keep on\nhaving to run back and forth to vote. And the good news is that\nyour responses are kept in the record and will be available to\nus and to people throughout the world that have interest in\nthis topic, as I think many, many do.\nI, for one, was inspired by the extraordinary bravery that\nwas demonstrated 30 years ago at Tiananmen Square and was\nimpressed with the courage of the individuals who stood and\nexpressed their desire for freedom and recognized a sense of\nvitality and energy among the people in China to consider\nalternative paths. Clearly, the whole country was not looking\nto become a democracy in our form, but they were looking at\nalternatives.\nMy perception today is that that may no longer be the case,\nand I wanted to get your thought about what the mood and the\nperception is among the people in China. I say that because\nwith the Uyghurs being incarcerated, with the effort to create\ncivic scores for individuals, there is a sense that perhaps the\nspirit of Tiananmen has been crushed and that it is forgotten\namong the people of China.\nI have a very close colleague who is a professor at a\nbusiness school. He has several Chinese students that are in\nhis business school class. Their classmates ask questions about\nfreedom of expression, about the freedoms that they hope to\nhave. And almost to a person, he says they defend the\ngovernment. They suggest that it is totally appropriate to\nprevent the Internet to foment anger among the Chinese people,\nthat they should be united. So he said it is extraordinary to\nsee that there is very little discussion of alternatives among\nthe Chinese people.\nAnd so I turn to you who watch closely what is happening in\nthe country and would ask for your perception as to whether or\nnot there a dissent movement within the country. Is there an\nopenness to change? Is there a desire for change, or has it\nbeen crushed by the government? Please.\nMr. Xiao. When social media just got into China around\n2003-2004, and there were a few hundred, a few thousand Chinese\nblogs, I asked my student researchers to say, look, there is\npolitical discussion on Chinese blogs. He came back to say no.\nThey only talk about money and business. Really?\nAfter 10 years, by the time of 2009, 2010 and 2011 when\nsocial media became, like hundreds of millions of users, even\nthe censors were working so hard, the online main voice opinion\nleaders are public intellectuals holding liberal political\nvalues. They have the maxim of the follower. But that leads to\nPresident Xi Jinping to have a full-scale crackdown on the\nChinese Internet. So if the control is not strong enough, those\nvoices not only coming out, not only dissent, but popular and\nmassive.\nSecond, yes. We heard all of this about Tiananmen in the\npast. We forgot about Tiananmen. Some people say I changed my\nmind, and some people say I do not know anything about\nTiananmen. But really? Do you really believe that? Why does the\nChinese Government try so hard to suppress every single word\nabout Tiananmen on the Internet? Do not say that the Chinese\nGovernment is making a mistake, wrong judgment on this. They\nknow as soon as they can let that repression a little bit off,\nthe memory do comes back. People do remember. People that are\nnow remembering are not telling you they are remembering\nbecause of fear. And they rule by fear.\nSenator Romney. Any other comments? Yes.\nDr. Richardson. Just a quick observation, Senator, that I\nthink one piece of the current puzzle really is about people\nwho leave China for more open environments precisely because\nthey want to know about or become exposed to different\npolitical systems or have the opportunity to study in places\nthat ensure academic freedom. And I think it is imperative for\nthe United States and other democracies to think of those\npeople in terms of solidarity. I think it is a complicated\ndiscussion now with concerns about national security or whether\npeople are acting as agents on behalf of the Chinese\nGovernment.\nBut I really feel very strongly, especially given that this\nis a mistake the United States has made in the past to\narbitrarily target people based on their citizenship or their\nethnicity, to not repeat that mistake at this particular\nmoment. There are people who come here precisely because they\nwant the rights and the freedoms, and I think there are people\nwho are feeling uncomfortably targeted. And it is imperative,\nin keeping the Tiananmen spirit alive--part of that lies here\ntoo in keeping this environment open for them.\nThe Chairman. Thank you.\nSenator Cruz.\nSenator Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nThank you to each of the witnesses for being here today.\nThis week marks a dark occasion in world history. 30 years\nago, thousands of Chinese protesters gathered in Tiananmen\nSquare demanding freedom and demanding democracy. The Chinese\nCommunist Party and the People's Liberation Army slaughtered\nthem. To this day, we still do not know exactly how many\nperished on that bloody dawn, as Nobel Peace Laureate Liu\nXiaobo described it.\nToday the CCP continues its war against the people of China\nand treats the rest of the world with similar disdain.\nIn my view, China poses the greatest long-term geopolitical\nthreat to the United States. They have to be dealt with and\ndealt with with clear eyes. We cannot break off relations with\nBeijing, but we must begin to rethink the assumptions that have\nguided U.S. policies toward China since Tiananmen Square.\nLet us start by addressing an uncomfortable reality here at\nhome: the role of U.S. technology in China's oppression of its\npeople.\nDr. Richardson, Human Rights Watch recently released a\nreport where your colleagues reverse engineered a Chinese\ncensorship app for smart phones. This app, called the\nIntegrated Joint Operations Platform, is a primary tool of mass\nsurveillance in Xinjiang. In this report, you referenced U.S.-\nbased companies that contribute to the censorship apparatus in\nXinjiang. This week, I plan to introduce legislation, the\nTiananmen Act of 2019, to restrict China's access to such\ntechnology.\nIn your judgment, how widespread is U.S. technology in\nmodern day Chinese surveillance and censorship?\nDr. Richardson. Senator, thanks for that question. I wish I\nhad a perfect answer to it. When we are done reverse\nengineering things, that is the next on our list of research\nprojects.\nBut I think the fact that we do not have clarity about that\nand that it is not easy to get clarity about that is a problem\nin and of itself. And we have discussed this morning the need\nfor due diligence strategies from all manner of companies,\nwhether they are tech companies, whether they are\ninfrastructure extractives, about what exactly the nature of\ntheir business is and how they can be sure they are not\nenabling or contributing to human rights violations.\nSenator Cruz. If you google ``Tiananmen Square'' in China,\ndo you learn anything about the massacre, about the slaughter?\nMr. Xiao. You see all the tourists and the tourist\npictures.\nBut remember this. The Chinese Government does not only\nsuppress those discussions, they are also guiding and inciting\nand sort of channeling the public opinion to the ideological\nfoundation that is supporting the regime. Only under the fear\nand under such technological support is that strategy is\neffective.\nBut now we have a game changer, which is the new layer of\nthe artificial intelligence, big data technology. Yes, the U.S.\nis still ahead of China in artificial intelligence, in many\nareas, but not in our implementations of facial recognition,\nnot in voice recognition, not in some of the other metrics of\ncollecting because China has a large set of data. They are\ntraining their algorithms to make the application much more\nprecise and comprehensive and fast. And this is the danger.\nSenator Cruz. Well, and many of us are concerned that U.S.\ncompanies are actively aiding and abetting China's suppression\nof its people and censorship of free speech. Indeed, days\nbefore the Tiananmen Square anniversary this year, reports\nbegan to circulate that Twitter had suspended the accounts of\ndozens of Chinese political dissidents. Twitter reportedly had\nrun a sweep for bots.\nHow would you describe the Communist Party's efforts to\ncoerce American companies into assisting the party censorship\nactivities?\nMr. Xiao. On Twitter, I can say this. I do not know what\nhas recently happened inside the Twitter company. I think they\nshould tell the public by giving a report on that.\nBut I do know that the Chinese espionage and intelligence\ncommunities have developed the tools, the technologies to\ninfiltrate Twitter, Facebook, gmails, to create fake accounts,\ncreate fake tweets, and to penetrate anybody's Twitter account\nor Gmail account or Facebook account--they have that\ntechnology.\nSenator Cruz. Mr. Chairman, if I may ask one more.\nThe Chairman. Please. Go ahead.\nSenator Cruz. Mr. Walker, you have warned about China's\nsharp power, and you have described the Chinese infiltration of\nAmerican higher education institutions. This is an issue that\nconcerns me greatly. Just this week, I introduced the Stop\nHigher Education Espionage and Theft Act, which gives the FBI\nand DHS new authorities to address the issues.\nMy question for you is what steps should universities take\nto insulate themselves from Chinese espionage, and what steps\nshould the U.S. Government take to protect higher education\nfrom these threats?\nMr. Walker. Thank you, Senator. I think the question you\nhave asked is related to the previous one as well, that this is\na pattern of either inducing or cajoling or coercing open\ninstitutions, independent institutions in open societies to\nbehave in ways they would not otherwise behave. And so you have\nalluded to some of these issues that are relevant to the\nstealing of technology and related things. But there is a full\nspectrum of challenges that have emerged that transcend those\nissues which can induce educators, students in our open\nsocieties to sidestep certain issues or to not talk about\ncertain things that are not welcome by the Chinese authorities.\nI think this is something that we need, as I have alluded\nto in previous writings and earlier today, to find ways to\ndevelop more durable democratic solidarity so that no single\ninstitution is exposed to the entreaties and the influence of\nthe Chinese party state. That is the most effective way over\ntime to have these institutions feel as though they can say no\nand essentially uphold liberal democratic standards.\nSenator Cruz. Thank you.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator Cruz.\nIn closing up, let me just talk about a couple things.\nNumber one, are all three of you aware of the Micron\nTechnology case, the case that emanates from Idaho? Micron\nTechnology is the second largest maker of DRAM memory chips in\nthe world, and the Chinese have stolen their trade secrets and\ntheir technology and gone home and patented them in China and\nnow are suing them in China over the use of their own\ntechnology. Are the three of you aware of that?\nThis is a poster child for what they are trying to\naccomplish with China 2025. You ought to get familiar with\nthat. It is on the radar of the administration at the highest\nlevel and obviously here in Congress. We have taken it up with\nthe Chinese ambassador here who is--he was born to be an\nambassador. He is defending the undefendable.\nLet me just close up with a point that I want to raise that\nwe just barely touched on, and that is the fact that all of us\non this committee and me maybe more so than others get touched\nby virtually every country in the world. We get the head of\nstate, the number two, the commerce person, defense person,\nforeign secretary person. And when you talk about what China is\ndoing in their country, first of all, you find that China is\ndoing something in every country. I mean, they are ubiquitous\naround the world. But when you talk to them about what they are\ndoing and you bring up the Sri Lanka case where the Sri Lankans\nlost the port--they took the money mistakenly and now have lost\nthat port. They come back and say, well, the United States is\nnot doing enough. China shows up with a bushel basket of money\nand the United States does not.\nYou sit and you listen to that. And these are people that\ndesperately need money in some places like Sri Lanka. What is\nyour response to that? What do you say to somebody like that?\nMs. Richardson, I think you started. Why do you not touch on\nthat for a minute, please?\nDr. Richardson. I find myself saying often in interviews\nthat we are all familiar with the phrase that nature abhors a\nvacuum. Nature has got nothing on the Chinese Communist Party,\nwhich will move into any space it is granted. And I think any\ngovernment that is serious about defending human rights needs\nto get out and become very aware very quickly of all of the\nspaces that the Chinese Government and Communist Party have\nmoved into and defend them vigorously now while they still can.\nMany of the key institutions that the United States relies on,\nthat people in China who want democracy rely on, that people in\nSri Lanka who want human rights rely on are under threat\nspecifically as a result of the Chinese Government pressure,\nand that should be a priority for the U.S.\nThe Chairman. Good answer. One of the problems is there is\nonly so much money, and the Chinese seem to be able to pick out\nplaces where they can put money. They do not do it like we do.\nI mean, it has got nothing to do with human rights. It has got\nnothing to do with democracy. It has got nothing to do with the\nrectitude of the government that is in power. All they are\nlooking for is the wedge to put the money into. And it puts us\nat a real disadvantage as we go out and do that. And that is\nparticularly true in American--I hear this from American\ncompanies all the time. They go out and bid on a job or what\nhave you. They do not have a Corrupt Foreign Influences Act\n(Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) in China, as you probably know.\nSo our companies are at a disadvantage there when they try to\ncompete.\nMr. Xiao. Not only about money. These countries, including\ntheir government, need to understand or recognize the danger of\nbeing so in debt or controlled, potentially being controlled\nand manipulated by the Chinese authoritarian regime. That is\nnot a rules-based game. They have oppositional parties--many of\nthem. They have a civil society. They have a relatively open\nmedia. Their people need to know this is not just about who\nprovides more money. And Chinese--a lot of those investments\nare also eroding the democratic systems in those countries.\nSo if there is some kind of public education throughout\nthose different countries China goes to, that public campaign\nto recognize what the Chinese Government is capable of doing to\ncontrol the countries--in those countries for China's interest,\nthen there is certain resistance that can help.\nThe Chairman. I think that is appropriate.\nI do not want to risk an international incident, so I am\nnot going to mention countries. But there are some countries\nthat are much more susceptible to this than other countries,\nand I think that is a good point.\nMr. Walker, do you want to close it up?\nMr. Walker. So I think one way to think about this,\nSenator, is that it is about the money in certain respects but\nit is not only about the money. And for so many of the\ncountries that we are talking about and as my colleagues have\nalluded to, they are now deeply engaged with China on a wide\nrange of levels in many spheres, and it is not just about the\ninfrastructure investment. It slowly becomes about the way\ntheir media and technology spheres develop. It is about the\ndegree to which perhaps weak political opposition can continue\nto sustain itself. It is about the way in which civil society\ncan operate, for example, in countries in sub-Saharan Africa\nand Latin America.\nAnd I would put it this way. I do not think the United\nStates and its partners have the luxury of not doing anything\nbecause China is projecting and exerting its values in a\nvigorous and purposeful way. To the extent we are not\nvigorously pursuing our own values and helping our partners\ndefend them in solidarity, it will be a losing proposition, and\nwe are going to find ourselves 5 years from now, say, if we do\nabout what we are doing now, in a very unpleasant position.\nThe Chairman. Well said.\nThank you all for being here today.\nFor the record, I will state that I am going to keep the\nrecord open until close of business on Friday. Members may have\nquestions to submit. If you would be so kind as to respond to\nthose at your earliest convenience, we would greatly appreciate\nit.\nThis has been a very good hearing. I think that it is going\nto be watched around the world probably, and I think it has\nunderscored the challenges that we are facing.\nThank you again so much for being here.\nThe committee will be adjourned.\n[Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]\n----------\nAdditional Material Submitted for the Record\nResponses of Mr. Xiao Qiang to Questions Submitted by\nSenator Robert Menendez\naccountability for tiananmen\nTo this day the Chinese government refuses to let the survivors of\nthe Tiananmen massacre and their families commemorate and honor their\ndead and continues to deny them justice in a concerted effort to wipe\nJune 4 from memory.\nOn May 20th, police ordered 82-year old Ding Zilin whose son Jiang\nJielian was killed in the June 4 massacre to leave her home in Beijing\nand travel more than 1,100km to her hometown, a common tactic used\nagainst activists to silence them during politically sensitive periods.\nDing Zilin is a founding member of Tiananmen Mothers, a group of\nfamilies of victims who are seeking an investigation into the June 4th\nbloodshed. I ask Unanimous Consent to submit for the Record a letter\nfrom the Tiananmen Mothers to China's leaders calling for\naccountability and justice. Their own government may seek to silence\nthem, but we can help them to have a voice.\nSuggested Reading for the 30th Anniversary of the Tiananmen Crackdown\nSubmitted by Senator Robert Menendez\n``Mourning Our Families and Compatriots Killed in the June Fourth\nMassacre: A Letter to China's Leaders'' By the Tiananmen Mothers\nhttps://hrichina.org/en/press-work/press-release/mourning-our-\nfamilies-and-compatriots-killed-june-fourth-massacre-letter\nCharter 8 December 17, 2017\nhttps://www.cecc.gov/resources/legal-provisions/charter-08-chinese-\nand-english-text\n``I Have No Enemies: My Final Statement'' By Liu Xiaobo\nhttps://china.usc.edu/liu-xiaobo-i-have-no-enemies-my-final-\nstatement-december-23-2009\nQuestion. How can we help ensure accountability and justice for the\nTiananmen Mothers and others who lost family and friends thirty years\nago?\nAnswer. Maybe honoring Professor Ding Zilin in some more prominent\nlevel from the U.S. Congress.\nQuestion. What additional measures can we take to assure June 4\nwill not be erased from history?\nAnswer. Publicly raise this issue with China at least every\nanniversary.\ndigital surveillance\nThirty years ago, the world was shocked when the Chinese Communist\nParty used tanks and the full force of the military to quash the pro-\ndemocracy movement. Today, they don't need to send in tanks. In\nXinjiang they've amassed a massive surveillance state that looks like\nit came out of a George Orwell novel. Where people live in fear and\nunder constant surveillance. Where technology allows the Chinese\ngovernment to collect data and aggregate people if they are so-called\n``threats'' to the Party, permitting the government to arbitrarily\ndetain more than a million Uyghurs in concentration camps.\nQuestion. What do we know about the Chinese government's use of\nsurveillance technology to suppress human rights in Xinjiang and\nelsewhere in China?\nAnswer. Pervasive surveillance in Xinjian both complements and\nfuels the ongoing mass detentions in the region.\nThis issue is widely reported by the media by now, such as:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/04/world/asia/xinjiang-\nchina-surveillance-prison.html\nhttps://logicmag.io/07-ghost-world/\nhttps://www.hrw.org/video-photos/interactive/2019/05/02/china-how-\nmass-surveillance-works-xinjiang\nQuestion. What role have U.S. companies played in providing China\nwith such technology?\nAnswer. New Jersey-based Infinova has directly provided\nsurveillance systems to Chinese authorities in Xinjiang and elsewhere;\nothers may have done the same. In other cases, U.S. companies support\nChinese surveillance firms by importing their products for sale.\nU.S. companies including Intel, Nvidia, Seagate, and Western\nDigital supply essential components to Chinese tech firms such as\nHikvision and Dahua.\nhttps://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/19/962492-orwell-china-\nsocialcredit-surveillance/\nResearch into underlying AI technologies is highly\ninternationalized. Oxford University's Jeffrey Ding, for example,\nrecently wrote that ``the seeds of China's AI development are rooted in\nMicrosoft Research Asia (MSRA) in Beijing [ . . . .] At the same time,\nMSRA has been essential for Microsoft.'' (The linked piece, describing\nfive key points Ding gleaned from his first year of compiling his\nChinAI email newsletter, is highly recommended.) Some news reports have\ncriticized companies and institutions over research partnerships\ninvolving military-linked institutions in China, but the actual risk\narising from these has been disputed by some experts, including Ding.\nThe issue is further complicated by widespread potential for dual use\nof AI technologies.\nAny U.S. company operating in China could be forced to help surveil\nits users there under recent security legislation. Notable recent\nexamples include Apple's transfer of local user data to servers\noperated in partnership with a government-owned Chinese partner, and\nGoogle's planned design for its apparently aborted ``Project\nDragonfly'' Chinese search service, which would have logged search\nqueries and tied them to users' verified identities. Twitter has also\nbeen the center of recent anxieties following a wave of account\nsuspensions affecting Chinese users shortly before the recent Tiananmen\nanniversary on June 4. (The company has said that these were\naccidental.)\nNumerous recent reports have also highlighted American investments\nin Chinese surveillance firms.\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/36b4cb42-50f3-11e9-b401-8d9ef1626294\nhttps://www.economist.com/business/2019/04/06/google-and-the-\nethics-of-business-in-china\nhttps://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/us-money-funding-\nfacial-recognition-sensetime-megvii\nU.S. banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are also\nsupporting Chinese tech companies more generally with large loans.\nAlthough the firms in question like Bytedance are not directly involved\nin abuses in Xinjiang, they, like any Chinese company in their\nposition, would be required to cooperate with censorship and\nsurveillance of users.\nQuestion. What role does Congress have in prohibiting these U.S.\ncompanies from doing business with Chinese security services?\nAnswer. The financial and technological stakes are high enough to\nmake restraint or self-regulation by industry unreliable at best. Any\ncontrols imposed by the executive branch might be traded away to serve\nother ends, given the current administration's evident lack of concern\nfor underlying rights issues. Congress therefore seems the most likely\nsource of robust, durable restrictions.\nQuestion. Should we require the State Department to publish a list\nof problematic Chinese companies who are aiding in the government's\ncrackdown on human rights?\nAnswer. ``Aiding in the government's crackdown of human rights''\nmight be too broad: any Chinese tech company could be forced to censor\ncontent or provide details of users' activity on their platforms, for\nexample. Narrower criteria such as direct provision of surveillance\nhardware or software to authorities in Xinjiang might both be more\npractical and provide a basis for more focused, effective policy. As\nwith the dual-use AI research problem noted above, the situation is\ncomplicated by the entanglement of political repression with legitimate\nlaw enforcement and urban management, which could make broader\nconditions for inclusion such as provision of surveillance systems to\nauthorities across China impractical.\nIn addition, the corporate landscape is fluid and opaque. With\nregard to Xinjiang, for example, facial recognition firm Megvii was\nreportedly not involved in the surveillance app examined by Human\nRights Watch, despite the presence of its own code among that obtained\nby HRW. Sensetime sold off its share in a Xinjiang-based joint venture\nin April, but the move has been described as ``only symbolic'' and ``a\nfig leaf.'' It would be a considerable challenge to compile a list\nwithout false positives that would damage its credibility and loopholes\nthat would undermine its effectiveness.\nQuestion. What additional steps can the U.S. government take to\nensure that technology does not fall into the wrong hands or shape how\nChina uses such forms of digital authoritarianism?\nAnswer. One important step would be to lead by example. American\nsurveillance technologies are widely used in dubious ways at home, and\nwidely sold to dubious regimes abroad. Particularly in the current\nclimate, this undermines the credibility of concerns about or measures\nagainst Chinese surveillance, both at home and abroad. In addition, the\nsale of U.S. surveillance technology to third countries increases its\nexposure to possible Chinese acquisition and reverse-engineering.\nAnother crucial step will be provide FBI and other intelligence\nagencies more resources and high priority to gather intelligence on\nsuch harmful technology transfer, and more responsive to human rights\norganizations' credit reports on those issues.\ncivil society\nIt comes as no surprise that the Chinese government harasses\nactivists and dissidents who wish to commemorate the June 4\nanniversary. The Chinese government also uses vague national security\nlegislation to ensure that civil society doesn't work on sensitive\ntopics such as human rights and democracy, closing the space for any\nwork to be done inside the country.\nQuestion. How can we help promote and partner with civil society\ninside of China?\nAnswer. The Chinese government has stepped up severely on cracking\ndown civili society in China in the past 6 years. One thing the U.S.\ngovernment can do is put some funding to support programs aiming at\nhundreds of thousands of Chinese students who are studying outside of\nChina, especially in America.\nfalun gong\nWhile we have rightfully been focused on the plight of the Uyghurs\nin recent months, the Falun Gong continue to experience systematic\npersecution at the hands of the Chinese government.\nQuestion. In your view, how should this administration be\naddressing the human rights violations perpetrated against the Falun\nGong?\nAnswer. The persecution on Falun Gong should be always included in\nthe list of human rights violations, particularly on religious\npersecutions and being raised to Chinese government by US government in\nall appropriate occasions.\nQuestion. Should we be encouraging the administration to consider\nusing Global Magnitsky sanctions against those individuals who are\ncredibly alleged to be responsible for the persecution of the Falun\nGong?\nAnswer. Yes, definitely.\ngreat firewall\nFor China to change for the better it is clear that it will be up\nto the Chinese people to better understand and challenge their\ngovernment's human rights practices. For example, the Tibetan people\nhave resisted peacefully to the Chinese government oppression for\ndecades. Yet all information about China's repression of the Tibetans\nis censored by the Communist Party.\nQuestion. Do you think the Chinese people appreciate the increasing\ndiscrimination suffered by Tibetans?\nAnswer. In general, not much. Chinese people are by large unaware\nof the increasing discrimination suffered by Tibetans. Not only lack of\nrelated information (they are all suppressed by Chinese censors) , but\nalso on going propaganda about how Tibetans are ``enjoying'' their\n``good life'' Brough by Han Chinese also enhanced this ignorance and\nprejudice about Tibetans among Chinese people. Fundamentally, this is\ndue to the information censorship and lack of public debate on those\nissues. Chinese people are not aware.\nQuestion. How does the ``Great Firewall'' function to suppress the\nfree-flow of information in China? What can be done to alter that\nsituation?\nAnswer. ``Great Firewall'' is a computational algorithms and\ninfrastructure which monitoring, filtering and blocking unwanted\nwebsites outside of China from Chinese internet users. It can be\ncircumvented by anti-blocking technology--commonly knows as Proxy or\nVPN-like technology - and there are large number of Chinese users\n(potentially tens of millions) are willing to use such technology to\ncircumvent the Great Firewall. Therefore, if US government increase\namount of funding in annual Internet freedom bill, and year-marked some\namount on China, it will guarantee effective institutional efforts to\ndevelop anti-blocking technology to keep up in this arms-race. The\ncurrent funding and China portion is simply not adequate. This not to\ncompletely undermine the Great Firewall, of which Chinese government\ninvested in billions of dollars to keep it up hand, but still can\neffectively mitigate its impact and serve millions, potentially tens of\nmillions of Chinese users freer flow of information.\n__________\nResponses of Mr. Christopher Walker to Questions Submitted by\nSenator Robert Menendez\naccountability for tiananmen square\nQuestion. How can we help ensure accountability and justice for the\nTiananmen Mothers and others who lost family and friends thirty years\nago? What additional measures can we take to assure June 4 will not be\nerased from history?\nAnswer. A crucial aspect of ensuring accountability and justice for\nthe Tiananmen Mothers and others who lost family and friends 30 years\nago is to make certain, first and foremost, that the Chinese\nauthorities are not successful in their efforts to erase the massacre\nfrom collective memory. In this regard, the stakes are growing as\nBeijing improves its capabilities in modernizing censorship. As scholar\nGlenn Tiffert's work has shown, the CCP is actively working to censor\nthe digitized archives of Chinese periodicals, books, documentary\ncollections, and other historical sources. American universities, as\nwell as universities in other free societies, have a vital role to play\nin cataloging and resisting this censorship to preserve the historical\nrecord of this period for Chinese and foreign scholars. More\nfundamentally, given the concerted effort of the Chinse authorities to\nsuppress independent information it is important to promote the\nconsistent flow of information about the Tiananmen massacre within, as\nwell as outside of, China.\ndigital surveillance\nThirty years ago, the world was shocked when the Chinese Communist\nParty used tanks and the full force of the military to quash the pro-\ndemocracy movement. Today, they don't need to send in tanks. In\nXinjiang they've amassed a massive surveillance state that looks like\nit came out of a George Orwell novel. Where people live in fear and\nunder constant surveillance. Where technology allows the Chinese\ngovernment to collect data and aggregate people if they are so-called\n``threats'' to the Party, permitting the government to arbitrarily\ndetain more than a million Uyghurs in concentration camps.\nQuestion. What do we know about the Chinese government's use of\nsurveillance technology to suppress human rights in Xinjiang and\nelsewhere in China?\nAnswer. The CCP has created a massive, centralized surveillance\nsystem within the Uyghur region, using biometric data, a network of\ncameras, and facial recognition AI to monitor, intimidate, and suppress\nthe Uyghur and other minority populations. Authorities in the region\nhave access to detailed information about the people they oversee, from\ntheir blood type to their cell phone and electricity usage, information\nthat police today can access in real time, or close to it. This\ninformation is then used to harass and often detain people for legal\nactivities that the government may deem suspicious. Apart from enabling\nthe imprisonment of millions of members of ethnic minorities in\nreeducation camps, this pervasive surveillance also creates an\natmosphere of fear, where people assume that the authorities are\nconstantly watching, in both private and public spaces, both online and\noffline. There is reason to believe that the tech-animated surveillance\nthat the CCP has put into place in the Uyghur region is part of a\nwider, iterative process of high-tech surveillance development that has\nnationwide implications.\nQuestion. What role have U.S. companies played in providing China\nwith such technology?\nAnswer. [No response received]\nQuestion. What role does Congress have in prohibiting these U.S.\ncompanies from doing business with Chinese security services?\nAnswer. [No response received]\nQuestion.

How can we help promote and partner with civil society\ninside of China?\nAnswer. As I noted in my written statement, at a fundamental level,\nany response to this global challenge to democracy presented by China's\nrise also needs to consider the essential importance of democratic\ndevelopment in China itself. In this regard, it is essential that the\ndemocracies continue to support people and organizations that can help\nenhance transparency, accountability, and human rights within China.\nfalun gong\nWhile we have rightfully been focused on the plight of the Uyghurs\nin recent months, the Falun Gong continue to experience systematic\npersecution at the hands of the Chinese government.\nQuestion.

Lisa\nMurkowski, Chairman of the Committee, presiding.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. LISA MURKOWSKI,\nU.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA\nThe Chairman. Good morning, everyone. The Committee will\ncome to order. This is a rare Wednesday session of the Energy\nand Natural Resources Committee.\nBefore we begin, I want to recognize and provide a tribute\nto two Park Service employees, Jeff Babcock and Charles Eric\nBenson. They tragically passed away in an airplane crash in\nWhitehorse, Canada, just a week ago, last Monday. They were not\non official business, they were ferrying a private aircraft\nfrom the Lower 48 up to Alaska, as so many Alaskans do. Both of\nthese individuals had extensive time within the Park Service.\nJeff, in addition to being with Park Service for years, had a\ndistinguished career in the military and with the Troopers in\nthe state. Eric Benson was also in the Air Force and the Army.\nTruly, truly great individuals, longtime Alaskans, and just\na reminder to us of just the inherent risk that sometimes we\nexperience in more rural places--but both individuals who\nserved their country and the agency very well. We were very,\nvery saddened in Alaska by this news, and our thoughts and\nprayers are with their families and loved ones.\nWe are here this Wednesday morning to consider the\nnomination of Robert Wallace, Rob, to be Assistant Secretary\nfor Fish and Wildlife and Parks at the Department of the\nInterior.\nThis is, for me, a critical position. This is a nomination\nthat we have been waiting for anxiously, I might add, for some\nperiod of time. And Mr. Wallace, I want to thank you for your\nwillingness to serve.\nThis is one of five Assistant Secretary positions at the\nDepartment. And the individual who holds it oversees two key\nagencies, the Fish and Wildlife Service as well as National\nPark Service--of course they have numerous and wide-ranging\nresponsibilities. But together they administer nearly 170\nmillion acres of lands in the United States, including 129\nmillion acres in Alaska alone.\nSo just to put it into context, colleagues, roughly 75\npercent of all of the acreage of national parks and wildlife\nrefuges in the country are in the State of Alaska. And Alaska\nis home to the largest National Parks and refuges--we have 7 of\nthe 12 National Parks that exceed one million acres.\nI am just putting it in context for the rest of you, when I\nsay that the Department of the Interior is like our\n``landlord,'' we really mean it because Alaskans need the\npeople that are in charge to recognize that their decisions\nhave a significant impact on our lives and our livelihoods.\nWe have had some highs and some lows within the Department,\nwhere again, it was more of a landlord, ``mother may I,'' type\nof relationship instead of a partnership. We want to return to\nthat partnership relationship, and I think we have seen\ncontinuing improved relations.\nWith so much land administered by the Department, Alaska\nhas a wide range of issues that need to be addressed. I don't\nthink I need to tell you, Mr. Wallace, but you are probably\ngoing to be spending a lot of time on Alaska-related issues--it\nis just the nature of it.\nBut we have some things that are on deck, most notably a\nlife-saving road to connect King Cove and Cold Bay. We also\nneed to stand up the oil and gas program that Congress\nauthorized for the 1002 Area, which is supported by nearly 70\npercent of Alaskans, including many Alaska Natives who actually\nlive within the 1002 Area.\nAt the national level, we need to address the multi-\nbillion-dollar maintenance backlog at our land management\nagencies, particularly for the National Park Service and for\nour wildlife refuges. This is something that many of us have\nbeen talking about, how we move forward on that. We need to\nprovide access for hunting and fishing and promote outdoor\nrecreation. There are also many other provisions from our\nrecent lands package that we need to get implemented for the\nbenefit of those communities and the people who live there.\nSo again, these are just a few of the imperatives that we\nhave in place and why it is so important to fill this position.\nMr. Wallace, you need to know that I am very confident that you\nhave what it is going to take in order to succeed within this\nposition. You bring decades of experience in public life,\nincluding your time at the National Park Service as well as\nhere in the Senate. You are no stranger to folks around here,\nincluding right here on this Committee. Mr. Wallace understands\nthe importance of public lands and the complex issues that\naffect them, so it is no surprise that a wide range of\nstakeholders, from Ducks Unlimited to the National Park\nConservation Association, are supporting the nomination.\n[The information referred to follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Interior Department has actually been without a Senate-\nconfirmed Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife since 2011.\nThat is a long time to have a vacancy in a very key position,\nso I look forward to moving Mr. Wallace's nomination quickly.\nFor those who have questions this morning, know that I am\ngoing to stick around for as long as it takes. We are going to\nhave a series of votes beginning at 11:00 which will kind of\ninterrupt things, but my intention is to conclude this hearing\nrapidly this morning, and then to report Mr. Wallace's\nnomination as soon as possible.\nI am going to turn to my Ranking Member for his opening\ncomments, and then I would invite Senator Enzi and Senator\nBarrasso, as the Senators from Mr. Wallace's home state, to\nprovide further introduction.\nSTATEMENT OF HON. JOE MANCHIN III,\nU.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA\nSenator Manchin. Thank you, Madam Chairman, for holding\nthis hearing today.\nWelcome to the Committee, Mr. Wallace, and thank you for\nyour willingness to serve and appear before the Committee.\nThe position of Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife\nand Parks, as we know, was created by Senator Tom Udall's\nfather, Interior Secretary Stewart Udall, in 1965, when he\nassigned responsibility for the National Park Service to the\nAssistant Secretary for what was previously only Fish and\nWildlife.\nIt is a big job, as the Senator has mentioned. The\nAssistant Secretary is responsible for overseeing 418 national\npark units with 85 million acres throughout all 50 states and 4\nof our territories, which are visited by upwards of 300 million\npeople a year, and 567 national wildlife refuges covering\nnearly 150,000 acres, which provide hunting, fishing, and\nrecreational enjoyment to another 55 million people a year.\nIn my little State of West Virginia, we have six national\npark units and two national wildlife refuges. I am sure Mr.\nWallace agrees with me that they are some of the greatest areas\nof the country. Like all the Senators, I believe the parks in\nmy state are the best and the most important compared to\neveryone else's. So you will have not heard this for the first\nor last time.\nUnfortunately, this important job has been without a\nSenate-confirmed office holder, as the Chairman has just\nmentioned, for eight years, nearly eight years. If confirmed,\nit will be on Mr. Wallace to provide the proper stewardship of\nsome of the most iconic places in the country, which have been\nset aside for this and future generations.\nI am pleased that we have a nomination for this important\npost. I am particularly pleased, Mr. Wallace, to be able to\nconsider you for this position with the caliber and background\nthat you have. I will read off a few. You know the National\nPark Service. You got started fresh out of college as a\nseasonal Park Ranger in the Grand Teton National Park. You\nlater went on to serve as the Assistant Director for the\nLegislative and Congressional Affairs for the National Park\nService. Equally important, you know the Senate and this\nCommittee. You were a Legislative Assistant to Senator Malcom\nWallop and later went on to become Senator Wallop's Chief of\nStaff. In '91 you became the Committee's Republican Staff\nDirector, a post you held for four years. During that time, the\nlandmark Energy Policy Act of '92 and nearly 100 park and\npublic land bills under the Committee's jurisdiction were\nenacted into law.\nAs if those ties to the Committee were not enough, your\nwife, Celia, used to work for the Committee and later for\nformer Senator Craig Thomas. So you are well involved, and we\nhave no way to have any excuses we can tolerate, okay? You know\nall the secrets.\nI have not had a chance to meet with you personally until\ntoday, but I know our mutually good friend, Dave Freudenthal,\nrecommends you at the highest level. Coming from my friend,\nDave, who is a former governor of the State of Wyoming and dear\nfriends of both Senator Enzi and Senator Barrasso, I take that\nconsiderably to be a compliment. One constant in your life,\nGovernor Freudenthal wrote, ``is a deep dedication to the\nnation's park system.''\nWith that, I finally note that the Committee has received\nletters of support for your nomination from the National Parks\nConservation Association, the Coalition to Protect America's\nNational Parks and National Shooting Sports Foundation.\n[The information referred to follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nI truly believe that you are going to be a bipartisan\nbuilder here bringing us all together, which is something that\nwe do not have too often and which is extremely important to\nall of us. But we want to thank you again for being here and\nletting us consider you for this important position for our\ncountry.\nThank you, Madam Chairman.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator Manchin.\nLet's turn to the Senior Senator from Wyoming to provide\nthe first introduction, and then we will turn to Senator\nBarrasso.\nSTATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL B. ENZI,\nU.S. SENATOR FROM WYOMING\nSenator Enzi. Thank you, Chairman Murkowski, and thank you,\nRanking Member Manchin, for your comments.\nIt's my privilege to introduce Mr. Rob Wallace, who is\ntestifying in front of the Committee today on his nomination to\nserve as Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and for\nNational Parks at the Department of the Interior.\nI've known Rob for many years, and I don't think there\ncould be a better choice to fill this position.\nNow, Tom Bodett of Alaska, known for his Motel 6 ads with\n``leave the light on,'' wrote a humorous book--the name of it\nis ``The End of the Road.'' And he begins that, ``I'm writing\nabout some of my friends. Please be kind to them.''\nI know you'll be kind to my very qualified friend, who is\nhere today, and as a result I won't ask to read into the record\nall of the letters of recommendation from all of the people\nfrom Wyoming and across the country, so.\nThe Chairman. They will be included as part of the record.\nSenator Enzi. Now I'm going to say some of the same things\nthat Senator Manchin said. I'm a retailer, and I know when you\nrun an ad the first time hardly anybody gets it. If you run it\nagain, a few more will do, and I'll be willing to run this\nseveral times if it will help with Rob's nomination.\nI'll be hitting the highlights. My colleague, Senator\nBarrasso, will fill in the details. We're a team, and our whole\ndelegation supports this nomination.\nRob was born and raised in Wyoming where he quickly learned\nthe important role the Department of the Interior plays in the\nupkeep of the state's natural beauty. In fact, Rob's first job\nafter college was with the National Park Service where he\nserved as a seasonal ranger in Grand Teton National Park. For\nfive years Rob helped with the preservation and maintenance at\none of our nation's finest parks.\nHis passion for our nation's public lands sent him here to\nWashington where he handled energy and environment issues for\nformer Wyoming Senator Malcolm Wallop. Before leaving Capitol\nHill, he served as a Staff Director of the Energy and Natural\nResources Committee.\nHe returned to Sheridan and the incredible Big Horn\nMountains until Rob once again came back to Washington where he\nhas served as Assistant Director of the National Park Service\nfor Congressional and Legislative Affairs. During this time, he\nsupervised the Reagan Administration's legislative agenda for\nnational parks which included readjusting visitor entrance\nfees, providing resources to fight the 1988 forest fires and\nadding several new units to the National Park System.\nIn 1989, Rob became Senator Wallop's Chief of Staff before\nheading back to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources\nCommittee in 1991 to again serve as Staff Director. I first met\nRob in 1995 when he served as Chief of Staff to Wyoming\nGovernor Jim Geringer, and I was in the state legislature.\nThese days Rob is still involved in Wyoming in the\nmanagement of public lands. Rob serves as the President of the\nUpper Green River Conservancy, a sage grouse habitat bank that\npartners with ranchers, energy companies and conservation\ngroups that work together to protect critical sage grouse\nhabitat in Wyoming.\nRob's career and character reflect a man willing to step up\nand serve his community and country. His years of experience at\nInterior and in the Halls of Congress have well suited him for\nthis new chapter.\nI'm pleased to introduce him to you today, and I hope you\nwill give his nomination full and fair consideration while\nyou're kind to my friend.\nThe Chairman. We look forward to doing just that. We\nappreciate your sage counsel and advice, Senator Enzi, and\nthank you for being here before the Committee this morning.\nNow let's proceed to Senator Barrasso.\nSTATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BARRASSO,\nU.S. SENATOR FROM WYOMING\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you, Madam Chairman, and I\nappreciate the opportunity to join my colleague, Senator Enzi,\nin introducing our friend, Rob Wallace, as President Trump's\nnominee to serve as Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife\nand Parks at the Department of the Interior.\nRob has had a very busy two days here in the Senate, Madam\nChairman. Yesterday I chaired his nomination hearing upstairs\nin the Environment and Public Works Committee because our\nCommittees both have jurisdiction over this. Of course, Rob did\na great job discussing his experience and views on issues\nfacing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\nSo today, I expect the Committee is going to focus more on\nthe Assistant Secretary's role to oversee the national parks\nwhich is actually where Rob began his career.\nMadam Chairman, Rob Wallace is the right person for this\njob. His 45-year career is comprised of service at nearly every\npossible, relevant level of state and Federal Government as\nwell as the private sector.\nHe has been on both sides of the legislative table in\ngovernment relations at the Park Service and during his service\nhere in the United States Senate. He led the staff for this\nvery Committee for former Senator Malcolm Wallop from Wyoming,\nand I know your father was Chairman of the Committee and at a\npoint worked very closely with Senator Wallop as two solid\nWesterners focused on the major issues that our nation faces.\nRob knows the challenges facing the Department from his\ntime as a seasonal ranger in Grand Teton National Park and as a\nlong-time resident of Teton County, Wyoming.\nAnd from his time in the private sector, Rob has continued\nto demonstrate his commitment to this nation's parks as one of\nthe founding members of the Grand Teton National Park\nFoundation. And he spent many decades in leadership of\norganizations that promote conservation and cultivation of our\nnatural resources for use in the future.\nOne could argue that Rob's entire career has prepared him\nto serve at Interior.\nI have known Rob for more than 35 years. I know him to be\npragmatic, fair, innovative. His dedication is second to none.\nIt is a pleasure to join Senator Enzi in introducing him\nhere today, and I look forward to working with him after the\nSenate confirms his nomination.\nThank you, Madam Chairman.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator Barrasso.\nThank both of you for the introduction. You have not left\nmuch for Mr. Wallace to speak to in terms of his background,\nbut we appreciate that because it is helpful to the Committee\nfor those who know him and apparently know him well.\nThe rules of the Committee which apply to all nominees\nrequire that they be sworn in connection with their testimony.\nSo I would ask, Mr. Wallace, that you please rise and raise\nyour right hand.\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to\ngive to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\nshall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?\nMr. Wallace. I do.\nThe Chairman. You may be seated.\nBefore you begin your statement, I will ask you three\nquestions addressed to each nominee who comes before this\nCommittee.\nFirst, will you be available to appear before this\nCommittee and other Congressional committees to represent\ndepartmental positions and respond to issues of concern to\nCongress?\nMr. Wallace. Yes, I will.\nThe Chairman. Are you aware of any personal holdings,\ninvestments or interests that could constitute a conflict or\ncreate an appearance of such a conflict should you be confirmed\nand assumed the office to which you have been nominated by the\nPresident?\nMr. Wallace. I do not.\nThe Chairman. Are you involved or do you have any assets\nheld in a blind trust?\nMr. Wallace. No.\nThe Chairman. Mr. Wallace, you may proceed. If you have any\nindividuals that you would care to introduce, you are certainly\nwelcome to do so. We are pleased to have you before the\nCommittee.\nSTATEMENT OF GEORGE ROBERT WALLACE, NOMINATED TO BE ASSISTANT\nSECRETARY FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE AND PARKS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF\nTHE INTERIOR\nMr. Wallace. Well, thank you, Chairman Murkowski. I was\ntalking to Sam Fowler a minute ago. I've probably been in this\nCommittee 100 times and this is the first time I've actually\nlooked at Senators in my testimony. So you look differently in\nthe front than you do from behind.\n[Laughter.]\nSenator Manchin. We have been told that.\nMr. Wallace. But Chairman Murkowski and Ranking Member\nManchin and members of the Committee, thank you for having me\nhere today. I am grateful to the President for nominating me to\nthis position and thank Secretary Bernhardt for his support.\nI would also like to recognize my family that's here today.\nWe've shrunk by one since yesterday as my wife is ill today and\ncan't make it. But my daughter, Morgan----\n[Laughter.]\n----you moved.\nThe Chairman. Welcome, Morgan.\nMr. Wallace. My daughter, Morgan just completed her\nsophomore year at Wake Forest as an engineering student and is\ndoing an internship up in New York and is down here to support\nher dad today. So Morgan, thank you for coming along.\nThe Chairman. We appreciate that, and we hope that your\nwife gets well.\nMr. Wallace. And my youngest daughter, Ella, just finished\nthe eighth grade. She's not here. She's studying for the SSAT\nunder the event that she may have to apply for a new school\nnext year. So she couldn't join us today either.\nBut I'm going to jump through my opening remarks because\nSenator Enzi and Senator Barrasso and even Senator Manchin\nmentioned much about my career.\nBut I would like to highlight that we're privileged, the\nfour of us, to live just south of Grand Teton National Park.\nIt's in the Yellowstone ecosystem and each year our community\nhosts millions of visitors who come to visit two of the world's\nmost majestic national parks. They also marvel at the abundance\nof wildlife we all enjoy thanks to wise management by state and\nfederal officials and the National Elk Refuge that's located in\nthe heart of our valley.\nBut I know simply living in a special place is not\nsufficient justification to ask for your support for this\nimportant position overseeing the National Park Service and the\nFish and Wildlife Service.\nAs Senator Enzi mentioned, my journey here began several\ndecades ago when I was hired as a Park Ranger in Grand Teton\nNational Park. There I patrolled the park's rivers and lakes,\nworked with the mountain rescue team, enforced game and fish\nregulations, performed law enforcement operations and emergency\nmedical services on the park's highways and traveled for days\nat a time in the backcountry on skis as part of my job. And\nthen in the winter and in the fall, if my job ended early, I\nworked at an elk hunting camp in the nearby national forest.\nBut it wasn't those daily adventures that made the most\nprofound impact on me, it was the number of issues that swirled\naround the park when I was there. It was a place where\ndignitaries from around the world traveled to attend the Second\nWorld Conference on National Parks and where the President of\nthe United States came to relax.\nUp the road in Yellowstone a raging debate was underway\nabout how to wean grizzly bears off human garbage. And in the\nTetons, a vibrant conversation was underway about fire\nmanagement, search and rescue and visitor use and resources\nprotection. Trying to figure out how to become more involved in\nthese debates that were so interesting to me prompted me to\nquit that job, volunteer on a campaign for the United States\nSenate which I arrived in Washington, had a job as an LA for\nthe EPW Committee and eventually as Minority Staff Director of\nthis Committee and along the way. It's been a fascinating\njourney about the important mission of the Park Service and the\nFish and Wildlife Service, a very important role that both the\nFederal Government and Congress plays in solving these\ncomplicated problems. And knowing that winning everything,\npeople seldom win by winning everything, and it's the\nbipartisan decisions that are the lasting ones.\nAnd if confirmed for this important position, I'm committed\nto working constructively with Congress on behalf of the parks,\nrefuges, fish and wildlife because I strongly believe well-\nmeaning people engage in good faith and communicate effectively\nthe opportunity to do good things for these special resources\nare unlimited.\nSo thank you for the opportunity to be here, Madam\nChairman, and I look forward to answering questions.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Wallace follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Thank you so much, Mr. Wallace.\nI am going to start my questioning by taking it back home.\nI mentioned in my opening that the Department of the Interior,\nparticularly Fish and Wildlife and the National Parks, play an\noutsized role in Alaska.\nSo a very broad question for you is, recognizing that, how\ndo you intend to approach this relationship with Alaska? I will\nmake it a little bit more specific in stating for the record\nsomething that you have heard and you have learned. Alaska is\ndifferent. It includes laws that govern federal land management\nwithin the state, like ANILCA, that seeks to strike the balance\nbetween conservation and economic development and striking that\nbalance is not always easy. With the last Administration we had\na real difficult time trying to find any balance there.\nSo as you share with me and the others how you will\napproach this relationship with Alaska, if you can, incorporate\ninto your response also what you intend to do to help exercise\nthe federal authorities in Alaska under ANILCA to, again,\nachieve and strike that balance.\nMr. Wallace. I think, Senator, my first trip to Alaska\noccurred almost 30 years ago and I got my first schooling on\nthe question you just asked me from another Murkowski that held\nthat position.\nThe Chairman. You have probably retained that lesson for\nsome time.\nMr. Wallace. Well, we went to the final exam at the Chena\nPump House after the first three or four hours of the lesson,\nso----\nThe Chairman. Enough said.\nMr. Wallace. He got me early in my career. And I do\nrecognize the special relationship between Alaska. You've got\nprobably, what, 55 or 56 percent of all of the wildlife refuges\nand national parks in the system.\nAnd one of the things that I plan to focus a lot on, if\nconfirmed for this position, is the role of partnerships. I\nmean, partner is an easy word to say, but as you probably know\nmore than most, it's a hard word to implement and especially\nrespecting the government-to-government partnerships between\nthe state and the Federal Government, the tribes and the\nFederal Government, local communities and the government\nbecause the Federal Government always shows up as the alpha,\nyou know, a partner in some of these debates. And that's a\nmodel that I will work very strongly to better equalize, if\nconfirmed.\nAs I said in my opening statement, I've been around the\nAlaska issues for quite a while back in the 1980s but I'm going\nto have some dusting up or some boning up to do too and I hope\nto be up in your state soon after being confirmed and perhaps\nhelp you and, you know, suggest some itineraries for me when I\nget up there.\nThe Chairman. We have it mapped out for you already in\nanticipation of your confirmation.\nBut specific to, kind of, boning up on ANILCA and some of\nthese other specific land management provisions that are unique\nto Alaska, we have made some headway in requiring that all\ndepartment employees in the Alaska region attend ANILCA\ntraining. This has been beneficial. They need to understand the\nimplications.\nWhat I would hope is that you would be able to commit to\nensuring that Fish and Wildlife and Park Service employees\nattend the same type of ANILCA training that other Department\nof the Interior employees attend. Again, just so that they can\nbe knowledgeable in these areas of law.\nThe other thing, and you have raised it, is the\nrelationship with the tribes. Consultation is, of course,\nrequired with our Native peoples. Some federal agencies do\nconsultation better than others. We have been fighting this for\nyears now. Consultation needs to be more than just, kind of, a\ncheck the box exercise. And one of the agencies where the\nconsultation has been frustrating is within the Fish and\nWildlife Service. They don't currently have any agency policies\nthat address consultation with our Alaska Native Corporations\n(ANCs). It is my understanding that Fish and Wildlife has\nacknowledged that this is lacking, but they don't have any\nspecific plans to address it within a timeframe.\nSo I would ask for a commitment that you will look into\nthis to direct Fish and Wildlife to address the consultation\nissue with the ANCs in official agency policy so that we can\nimplement better and meaningful consultation.\nMr. Wallace. I do commit to that.\nI look forward to meeting Tara Sweeney, if I'm confirmed. I\nknow she's highly respected in the world of tribal relations\nand I want her as an advisor to me on how, you know, the\nagencies I'm responsible for are doing with her and her\ncoalition and constituency. So I look forward to that\nrelationship.\nThe Chairman. She will be a good guide.\nLet me turn to Senator Manchin.\nSenator Manchin. Thank you, Madam Chairman.\nMr. Wallace, as you probably noticed if you kept tabs on us\nhere in Congress, things can become a little unreliable at\ntimes as far as the job we are supposed to do, like keeping the\ngovernment open.\nMr. Wallace. Senator?\nSenator Manchin. Like keeping the government open.\nSo what happened, we had a shutdown in 2013. We shut all\nthe parks down at that time. We just shut it all down.\nThen last year we come back with another shutdown because\nof the inability for us to do our job. The last time, Mr.\nBernhardt at that time, moved in and kept the parks open to a\npoint to where the sanitary conditions became intolerable. He\nhad to make a decision. He made a decision to reach into the\nentrance fees of the parks and spent about a quarter of a\nbillion dollars to try to pay people to come in and clean the\nbathrooms and clean the garbage and things of that sort.\nI am not saying that this might not happen again. I hope it\nnever does, but if it does, have you given it any thought, how\nyou would handle that or would you keep the parks open and try\nto ask for compensation for that or the flexibility or\nbasically just shut them down? It is a tough one.\nMr. Wallace. It is a tough one, Senator.\nAnd I haven't been down to the Department yet. I think this\nis my 23d day as being a nominee which included about three\nround trips back home to negotiate with my 14-year-old on her\nlife, but I know it's an important question.\nI talked to superintendents that used fee money to keep\ntheir parks open during the shutdown.\nSenator Manchin. Last year.\nMr. Wallace. And it's a question I'd like to get a little\nbit more educated on before----\nSenator Manchin. Well, we would like to work with you on\nthat because we don't think that the citizens of this great\ncountry should pay the price for our inability to do our job.\nMr. Wallace. Right.\nSenator Manchin. It is a shame. I hope we never have\nanother shutdown, but as toxic as things are from time to time,\nit could happen. We have to work through that and, basically,\nprovide the fees to keep the parks sanitary if we are going to\nkeep them open, but that decision has to be made.\nMr. Wallace. I understand.\nSenator Manchin. So that is a tough one.\nI am going to defer because I know we are running for\nvotes. I have a lot of our Senators here that want to ask\nquestions, so I will basically yield my time to Senator\nHeinrich right now if he would like to go with his.\nSenator Heinrich. Thank you very much.\nMr. Wallace, are you a big fan of the North American model\nof wildlife conservation?\nMr. Wallace. I am. The tenants that--yes, sir.\nSenator Heinrich. I am not surprised by that answer. And I\nam as well. I think it is that we are frankly the envy of the\nworld because of that model.\nAnd a lot of people today, I think, lack perspective on the\nhistory of that and don't realize that there was a time in this\ncountry when white-tailed deer were almost wiped out. It is\nkind of hard to imagine that. We had not a single elk in New\nMexico. Today we have 70,000, and that is certainly something\nto be very proud of. The exception to that success, I think,\nhas been ironically our national mammal, the American Bison.\nAnd I actually don't have a question on this, I just want you\nto think about the fact that that is a somewhat embarrassing\nomission in our history.\nI think it is long past time that we start to find a path\nwith all those partners you mentioned, with states, with tribes\nand the Federal Government, Fish and Wildlife, to recover\nsomething more than a postage stamp, ecologically significant\npublic land, a huntable, wild bison herd somewhere in North\nAmerica because I think when Teddy Roosevelt put us on this\npath, that would have been one of the things that he would have\nhad out in the future.\nSo that is not a question, that is one of those things for\nyou to think about because you don't have enough on your plate\nalready.\nI want to ask you about the maintenance backlog real quick.\nWe hear so much about the park's backlog and that is critically\nimportant. But we also have enormous backlog on our wildlife\nrefuges, in our national forests, on BLM lands. We have closed\ncampgrounds and unusable trails and all of that has enormous\neconomic implications for our states.\nI would just ask that, if confirmed, would you support\nworking with us on a maintenance funding solution that\naddresses all of those public land agencies and not just the\nNational Park Service?\nMr. Wallace. I certainly will, Senator.\nI think the work that you all did with the 115th Congress\nwith that lands package was historic. I mean, it's something\neverybody, you should all be proud of going home to say, this\nis what we did. 116th is a chance to do the same thing with the\nmaintenance backlog.\nAnd I agree, it's not just the national park areas. It's\nBLM. It's clearly the Fish and Wildlife Service areas and yes,\nsir.\nSenator Heinrich. I will just leave you with this thought.\nYou know, some of that needs to be done directly through those\nagencies. We often forget that a huge part of that backlog is\nalso road maintenance and much of that is supposed to be\nactually paid for out of the Highway Trust Fund. We need to\nthink about both of those pieces as we work together on the\nbacklog issue.\nThank you, Chair.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator. And know that we are\nplanning on having an oversight hearing in the next week or so,\nand we are focused really keenly on this transportation piece\nof things.\nLet's go to Senator Hyde-Smith.\nSenator Hyde-Smith. Thank you, Madam Chairman.\nMr. Wallace, congratulations so much on your nomination to\nbe the Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife and Parks, one of\nmy very favorite agencies, no doubt, and it is so important for\nus to have these Senate-confirmed leaders over this agency that\nhave such an impressive resume as yours. I think you are just\nthe right person for this job, and thank you for willingness to\ntake it.\nYou know, Mississippi is very proud of its national parks\nand wildlife refuges. And with the enactment of the lands\npackage earlier this year, the establishment of the Medgar and\nMyrlie Evers Home as a national monument and, you know, whether\nit be the bird depredation for our many catfish farmers as we\nproduce more catfish than anyone in the country. These things\nare certainly important to my state and federal duck hunting\nregulations and the recreational opportunities at Mississippi's\n15 national wildlife refuges, the programs and activities\ncarried have such an impact on our state. So thank you for\nbeing willing to do this.\nOne issue, in particular, I would like to highlight is\nobviously catastrophic flooding that is occurring right now in\nMississippi in the delta. Hundreds of thousands of acres have\nbeen underwater now for more than three months affecting, of\ncourse, our timberland, our wildlife habitat and the homes and\ncommunities. I have been over there multiple times and the\ndevastation is truly real.\nIncluded in the flooded area are a number of national\nwildlife refuges with more than 100,000 acres of prime wildlife\nhabitat. I am not suggesting you can fix this problem, but you\nneed to be aware of the significant damages that are occurring\nright now.\nI certainly want to invite you to travel to Mississippi in\nthe coming months, not only to observe the flooding issue but\nalso to meet with Mississippians on various issues that are\nvery important to them. So I extend that invitation to you, and\nI certainly hope that I can visit with you while you are in our\nstate.\nThank you very much.\nMr. Wallace. I gratefully accept.\nThe Chairman. Let's go to Senator King.\nSenator King. Thank you.\nMr. Wallace, I did not realize until Senator Enzi's\nintroduction that you had worked with Jim Geringer. Jim and I\nwere governors together for eight years. He was one of my\nfavorite people in the country. I hope you will give my warmest\nregards to Jim and Sherri, please, when you see them.\nMr. Wallace. I will.\nSenator King. We had a great relationship.\nThis has been, sort of, touched on, but the Secretary and\nhis predecessor were big supporters of the Restore Our Parks\nAct which has the potential to be a historic action,\nbipartisan, to really make a difference to deal with this 30-,\n40-year-old deficit. I hope you will be a strong voice on that\nsubject as well.\nMr. Wallace. I will, Senator.\nSenator King. Thank you.\nI have dealt with few issues as complicated as fish passage\nand which fish should be allowed where. We have one of these\ndisputes going on in Maine now between U.S. Fish and Wildlife\nand the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife where\nFERC has recently issued an order to essentially open up fish\npassage into a lake that has been blocked to certain species,\nalewives, in particular, for many years to protect the\nlandlocked salmon and bass fishery.\nI don't expect you to wade into this except I would ask\nthat you would use your good offices, if confirmed, to try to\nfacilitate discussions between our state Fish and Wildlife\nfolks and the federal agency to see if there is some way to\nfind a solution to this issue, because there are people in\nMaine who feel that if this is opened up, as has been proposed,\nit will destroy a very well-established and important fishery\nin landlocked salmon and bass. Would you give me your\ncommitment to take a look at this issue and try to foster some\ndiscussions?\nMr. Wallace. I will, Senator.\nAs you correctly noted, it's an issue that I'm not familiar\nwith but I know it's important to you and I commit to learning\nmore about it and being back in touch with you about what I've\nlearned.\nSenator King. And I just wanted to add my voice to those\nwho have been very impressed by your background, your approach\nto these issues.\nNational Parks are very important in Maine. We have two\nnational park units, Acadia National Park, one of the original\nnational parks dating back to 1916, and one of the newest park\nunits which is Katahdin Woods and Waters which is inland in\nMaine. I invite you to come and visit either or both of those\nwonderful spots. I think you'll see how important they both are\nto their communities and to the region and to the State of\nMaine.\nMr. Wallace. You know, I would like to choose both.\nSenator King. Thank you.\n[Laughter.]\nMr. Wallace. I would also say, Senator, two of the finest\nsuperintendents spent time in Wyoming, Kevin Schneider at\nAcadia and Timmy Hudson that's up in Katahdin. Both were, you\nknow, got steeled a little bit. They were working in Wyoming\nyears ago.\nSenator King. That is right.\nKevin Schneider is doing a wonderful job, and I am thinking\nof introducing legislation that will disallow Tim Hudson from\nretiring because he is doing such a great job.\n[Laughter.]\nMr. Wallace. Well, he's doing--he's been trying for a long\ntime. So the bully pulpit seems to be working.\nSenator King. I know. I know.\nWell, thank you very much, Mr. Wallace, for your commitment\nand your willingness to work with us. I look forward to working\nwith you on those park units and other issues that arise, both\nin the parks and also with U.S. Fish and Wildlife.\nMr. Wallace. Well, I look forward to that. Thank you,\nSenator.\nSenator King. Thank you.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator King.\nSenator Cortez Masto.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you.\nMr. Wallace, welcome. Congratulations on your nomination.\nWelcome to your family, those that are here and those that are\nlistening, I am sure, intently.\nI am very impressed with your background and want to bring\nsomething to your attention, particularly in Nevada.\nI am the Senior Senator from Nevada and, you may or may not\nknow this, I would assume on your background you know something\nabout this. But 87 percent of the land in Nevada is owned by\nthe Federal Government. That means that we have to really bring\nkey stakeholders together, including the Federal Government,\nwhen we have issues that are contradictory or issues that we\nneed to deal with when it comes to land and land management.\nOne of the issues I am going to just bring to your\nattention and ask for your support, and it deals with the\nDesert National Wildlife Refuge in Southern Nevada. It is a\nvery unique place. It is the largest wildlife refuge in the\nLower 48 states, encompassing roughly 1.5 million acres in the\nState of Nevada. It is predominately known as the home to\nNevada's iconic bighorn sheep, although numerous other plant\nand wildlife species also share the range. Much of the range,\nthough, is jointly administered with the Air Force as part of\nthe Nevada Test and Training Range which is used as a proving\nground and flight test area. The NTTR, the Test and Training\nRange, is the largest air and ground military training space in\nthe contiguous U.S. and has no interference with commercial\naircraft for that reason. And right now, both the Desert\nWildlife Refuge and the NTTR contribute to this unique\ncharacter of Nevada where we have competing interests, and we\nhave to have everybody work together.\nThe challenge we are having right now is that the Air Force\nis seeking a land withdrawal and part of that land withdrawal\nis seeking to expand into the national wildlife refuge. This\nhas required all of our stakeholders to come together and\nreally figure out how we address this issue. Many are opposed\nto it and so much so that our legislature, the Nevada State\nLegislature that just finished since sine die this past week,\nthey issued a resolution opposed to any land withdrawal taking\naway from that national wildlife refuge.\nI bring this to your attention because so far, in respect\nto this issue, the Interior Department has been largely silent.\nSo what I am asking from you is help. I need your commitment\nthat you would be willing to come to the table, sit with all of\nus, figure out how we address this, bring all these competing\ninterests together and have this conversation so that we can\nall walk away knowing that voices were heard and we can come to\nsome final solution addressing this land withdrawal. Are you\nwilling to do that?\nMr. Wallace. I am, Senator.\nI think it goes back to what I mentioned early on to\nSenator Murkowski, you know, partnerships are sometimes easy to\nsay and hard to do, but I'm committed to making them work. It's\nthe secret sauce in almost all public policy. If you can get\nthe right group of people together in good faith, remarkable\nthings happen.\nThere may be issues within the Department where we've seen\nthis before, where other military withdrawals have occurred\nwith wildlife refuges, maybe there's a lesson learned out there\nthat we can bring to Nevada. But I'm happy to learn more and\ncommitted to working with you.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you. I appreciate that.\nCongratulations again on your nomination.\nMr. Wallace. Thank you, Senator.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator.\nSenator Daines.\nSenator Daines. Thank you, Madam Chair.\nMr. Wallace, it is great to have you here today.\nIn looking at your bio, I believe you truly have the\nknowledge, the experience, the expertise, the service, of the\nAssistant Secretary of the Department of the Interior.\nI do have a few Montana priorities I would like to discuss\nwith you though. I recently spoke with Secretary Bernhardt on\nthe importance of addressing workplace and sexual harassment in\nour national parks. I believe it is one of the most important\nissues for you to focus on in your new position. In fact,\nMontanans and employees deserve a safe work environment. We\nmust do all that we can to ensure that. We also discussed the\nneed to address the growing maintenance backlog in our national\nparks. The Secretary committed to me to continue to work on\nthese two important issues and in your new position you would\nalso play a very key role.\nMy question is, if confirmed as Assistant Secretary for\nFish, Wildlife and Parks, do I have your commitment to work\nwith me to address harassment as well as the maintenance\nbacklog in our parks?\nMr. Wallace. Absolutely on both, Senator.\nI, you know, as a father of a couple of pretty capable\ndaughters, I can't imagine. I'd love them to have a career in\nthe National Park Service some day and the fact that they may\nfind themselves in the bottom of the Grand Canyon for two weeks\nin a predatory environment, it just is disgusting and something\nthat I am fully committed to making sure that, from the top to\nthe bottom, that policy is well underway in being implemented.\nAnd the maintenance backlog I talked about earlier, what a\ngreat legacy for all of us to work on together.\nSenator Daines. Well, I count myself very fortunate to have\nthe Ranking Member, Senator King, on the National Parks\nSubcommittee with me. And I know it is a passion we share.\nWe want to see this actually get done. I think it is a\ngreat opportunity, tremendous bipartisan support. Egos are set\naside right now. I think we can actually get something done\nhere in the Senate. So thank you.\nWe also share being fathers to a couple of daughters, so I\nshare your passion for your daughters as well.\nI recently visited Libby, Montana, to discuss with\ncommunity members the importance of getting the Rock Creek and\nMontanore mines up and running. Literally, over three decades\nin regulatory process at this point. These are over 400 jobs\nfor a part of Montana that some describe as poverty with a\nview. We need these jobs badly. They are a critical part in\nNorthwest Montana. They are heavily supported by the local\ncommunity. We had Democrats, we had Republicans, all there in\nsupport of this when I was up there recently, elected\nofficials, school administrators, many more.\nAnd despite these decades, decades of permitting, these\nmines are still years away from being fully operational. We are\ntalking about hundreds of high wage jobs, large increases in\nlocal tax revenues, all put on hold because of lengthy and\nburdensome permitting and endless litigation, often politically\ndriven.\nWhile I understand it is the Forest Service we are\ncurrently waiting on for this specific project and we hope to\nhave a supplemental EIS out any day now for the Montanore mine,\nthe Fish and Wildlife Service plays a really important role in\npermitting projects on federal lands.\nMy question is, if confirmed, what modernization and\nstreamlining would you like to undertake to improve the\ncoordination and the consultation with other agencies to speed\nup the permitting process?\nMr. Wallace. You know, Senator, this is one of those issues\nI'd like to come back with you and learn a little bit more\nabout to make sure we're focusing on the right issues and that\nI'm in a position where I can be of most help to you.\nBut again, it goes back to the state and the partnerships.\nIt's the secret sauce. And we all, sort of, have a commitment\nto finding a way to make it work.\nAnd in your particular--I look forward to coming back and\nhopefully even seeing you out West to talk about it.\nSenator Daines. That would be the best place to talk about\nit. Thank you.\nMr. Wallace. Thank you.\nSenator Daines. The last thing I want to talk about is the\nEndangered Species Act reform needed.\nThe Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been successfully used\nto recover endangered and threatened species for decades.\nHowever, excessive litigation--and we see that in Montana as\npart of the Ninth Circuit Court--and other abuses has led to\ndelays in delisting recovered populations.\nDespite the Fish and Wildlife Service proposing the\ndelisting of the Greater Yellowstone grizzly bear and the gray\nwolf in the Lower 48, their progress has been caught up in more\nlitigation.\nIt is my opinion that sound science should derive the\nlisting and delisting of species, not fringe litigation and\npersonal opinions. If the science shows the species has\nrecovered, it is quite quantitative at the end of the day, we\nshould be able to delist and use these resources to recover\nspecies that are actually endangered.\nWe should celebrate the fact that the grizzly bear has\nrecovered. It is exceeding all the targets that were set when\nit was listed.\nMy question is, if confirmed, how will you address ESA\nabuses and continue to promote sound science to delist\nrecovered species?\nMr. Wallace. Again, this would be a question that I, having\nnot been at the Department and having a chance to, kind of,\nreally, look under the hood to the degree that I think your\nquestion requires, to just speak in general terms that I\ncompletely agree that the idea that the Endangered Species Act\nhas worked. We've seen some remarkable examples of that in the\nareas where we live, the bald eagle, the peregrine falcon, the\nblack-footed ferret, the whooping crane, the grizzly bear. And\nfor it to continue to work, people have to have confidence in\nthe transparency, the science that goes in front of a listing\ndecision, the science that goes on a recovery, the transparency\nof how it goes. But once it's recovered it needs to go back to\nthe management of the states or the tribes as envisioned.\nSo I'm going to look under the hood more, have a look at\nmore detail, but in principle for it to work it has to be\ntransparent and once a species is recovered, it needs to go\nback under the management of the states or the tribes.\nSenator Daines. Thank you.\nI am out of time here, but that is an important principle.\nI will tell you, out in Montana, we do a pretty good job of\nmanaging wildlife and it is time to transfer that\nresponsibility back to the State of Montana as it relates to\ngrizzly bears as we delist it.\nThank you.\nMr. Wallace. Thank you, Senator.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator.\nSenator Cantwell.\nSenator Cantwell. Thank you, Madam Chair.\nMr. Wallace, thank you for your willingness to serve.\nI want to ask you about a couple of large issues.\nObviously, the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I have heard\nyou talk about the backlog and maintenance already this\nmorning, but what about making sure that we get funding at the\nlevels that we need to have continued access to lands that are\nimportant in carrying out the larger mission?\nAnd on wildfires which are, you know, we have one raging in\nthe state right now in Grant County. These are big risks to our\nwildlife as well. So could you address that and what you think\nwe should be doing to mitigate those impacts?\nMr. Wallace. Senator, I've been around the Land and Water\nConservation Fund pretty much my entire career. It's a\nmarvelous tool to help people enjoy their public lands,\nrecreate.\nI've heard Secretary Bernhardt mention in testimony, and I\nfeel the same way, that with the fact that we're both at the\nDepartment, hopefully in confirmed positions for me, we'll have\na better opportunity to, sort of, argue and fight for that\nissue in the next budget cycle that I know it is important to--\nI mean, almost every member that I talk to brings that up. And\nI'm fully committed to working to see that funding at the level\nyou all will find satisfactory.\nWildfire policy, again, I haven't been to the Department\nyet, but I know that just based on watching the terrible fires\nthat we've experienced in the West over the last few years that\nthere's a lot of deep thought that needs to go into that.\nAnd I'm going to get smarter about the policies, again as I\nsaid to Senator Daines, look under the hood and hopefully be\nable to come back and have a more meaningful conversation with\nyou about ideas on how to do that.\nSenator Cantwell. But you do believe that climate is\nimpacting our fire situation?\nMr. Wallace. I believe that climate is changing, that man\nhas a role in it and it's a big question with a lot of\nvariables. Regardless of the cause, the fact is that we have to\nbe involved in, sort of, healthy forests and healthy management\nand I'm fully committed to the idea that climate is a man-\ncreated issue and that smart science needs to be a very\nimportant part of how we adapt or modify our performance.\nSenator Cantwell. We are getting very, very, very technical\nabout this in the State of Washington, and one of the reasons\nwhy we are is because we are putting incredible investment in\nstream restoration. And then, basically we are spending\nmillions and millions of dollars to try to return salmon to a\nparticular area and then next thing you know, a devastating\nfire season comes through there and basically erodes the\nhundreds of millions of dollars that we have invested.\nSo we are trying to think strategically about how we\npreserve those investments and continue to make progress\nwithout having hundreds of thousands of acres burn up in one\nafternoon and then eroding our streams and our stream progress.\nMr. Wallace. I was the head of Congressional Relations in\n1988 when the Yellowstone fires occurred. And up until that\npoint, you know, a controversial fire was 10,000 acres, 15,000\nacres, that made big national news.\nThat was a rounding error in 1988. It became so and I can\njust, when I read about what has happened in your state, in\nCalifornia and others, I look back to that experience and just\ncan't imagine when you've got actually homes and roads and\ninfrastructure involved in those fires too. So Senator, I'm\nfully committed to understanding what you're telling me.\nSenator Cantwell. Right. So just if you could take a look\nat that and then maybe send us some thoughts about this or we\ncan pose a more specific question, but what we are really\ninterested in is how does, in this position or new role, would\nyou, you know, help to target protection of these most\nvulnerable wildlife corridors, you know, from fire? How would\nyou engage in the debate to make sure that we, at Interior, are\ndoing this important work?\nSo we can, I can get that for the record, Madam Chair. I\ncan pose a question for a written answer.\nBut we do think that this is a very important role because,\nagain, we are spending lots of money to protect these areas,\nbut we are going to have to be more strategic about how we\nachieve it.\nMr. Wallace. You know, Senator, one of the things I like\nabout, and again, I haven't had the benefit of a lot of very\nsmart people that I'll have the privilege of working with, if\nconfirmed in this position at Interior, but if you look at the\nsystem that the Assistant Secretary has, it's about almost a\nquarter of a billion acres in all 50 states, five territories,\na lot in Alaska.\nAnd I would like to look at it about where the stress\npoints are in that entire system, you know, along the coast in\nLouisiana, it may be adapting to climate change. And I saw\nGovernor Edwards actually thinking about moving people out of\nSouthern Louisiana. You talk about leadership in your State in\nOregon. It's ocean acidification. It may be in Wyoming,\ninvasive species or fire or migratory corridors or somebody\nthat cares about historical preservation. It may be just\nfinding the last piece of like Champion's Hill at Vicksburg to\nadd to the system.\nSo there's stress points all over, and I think if I do my\njob correctly, I'm able to look at fire, invasive species,\nmigratory corridors, climate and make sure that the applied\nscience and the resource managers have the tools to address the\nproblems that you so eloquently raised a minute ago.\nSenator Cantwell. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator.\nI am just reminded that I was reading an article coming in\nthis morning about the road at Denali National Park where you\nget into the heart of the park itself and what we are seeing.\nWe are seeing a series of landslides, which you and I are\nworking on legislation, but landslides and slippage that is due\nto a thaw in the permafrost. It is going to be a considerable\nundertaking for the Park Service. So when Senator Heinrich\nmentioned the piece about parks' maintenance and the funding\nand just the infrastructure side of the ledger, it is just a\nreminder that what we see from climate exacerbates already\nchallenging issues when it comes to infrastructure for our\nparks.\nWe will have an opportunity to discuss more of this when we\ndo our parks oversight.\nMr. Wallace, I just have a couple more quick things because\nI think what members have done is, they have really highlighted\nthe priorities. I appreciate Senator Daines bringing up the\nworkforce and ethics issues. I think that is very key, and I\nwould join him in a sense of urgency in making sure that we\naddress these and we address them boldly and quickly. You have\nheard from all of us about the park maintenance. We need a\npartner to work with on that. Again, so many of the local\npriorities that you get involved with that will be important\ngoing forward.\nI just wanted to ask for the record here. Again, this goes\nback to more Alaska-specifics, but under the Tribal Self-\nGovernance Act, the Department of the Interior is authorized to\nwork with tribal governments to enter into compacts or annual\nfunding agreements, and these are government-to-government\nagreements. They involve indirect costs. They are separate.\nThey are different from park concessions.\nWe have been working in Alaska to, kind of, pioneer in this\narea. The Sitka Tribe has recently, actually it has been a\ncouple of years now, they have entered into a compacting\nagreement with the Park Service at the Sitka National Historic\nPark. I have been out there. We have, kind of, walked through\nthe bumps and the hurdles. But it is important to try to get\nthis right with the Sitka Tribes because other tribes and\nnative corporations are looking at this as possible models\ngoing forward. I would just put this on your radar, and ask\nthat you get up to speed on this, commit to directing some of\nyour staff, again, not only on the training side but to see\nwhat it is that we can do to make these compacts workable\narrangements, not only workable for parks but workable for the\ntribes that engage in those.\nMr. Wallace. I'll certainly commit to getting up to speed,\nSenator. Thank you for bringing that to my attention.\nThe Chairman. Lastly, a couple of years ago Congress passed\nthe National Park Service Centennial Act, and we expanded the\nagency's authority to award and administer the various\ncommercial services, contracts for operation and expansion of\ncommercial visitor facility services. But it has been almost\nthree years now, and we haven't seen Interior implement any of\nthese regulations. So we are waiting. We are not quite sure why\nit has taken three years on this. But again, when you think\nabout the necessity to provide for a level of services within\nour parks, it is maintenance, it is upkeep that we need to\nfocus on. But if we haven't done a good job on the service\nagreement side of it, that is also an area that needs some\nattention. I just ask that you to look into why, some three\nyears after the fact, we have not seen any implementing regs\nyet.\nMr. Wallace. I will, Senator, thank you.\nThe Chairman. Thank you.\nSenator Manchin.\nSenator Manchin. I just have one comment.\nI look forward to working with you. I look forward to\nvoting for you.\nI think you have a great opportunity, Mr. Wallace, to\nreally make some changes, necessary changes, that we have and\nalso be able to have the support in a bipartisan way of the\nresources that will be needed to do the park maintenance to\nbasically secure our parks, make them more, I think, more user\nfriendly, if you will, and hopefully navigate your way through\nsome of the difficulties that we don't intentionally try to put\nbefore you but might come about because of a dysfunction that\nsometimes interrupts our day-to-day operations here.\nBut I really do look forward to working with you and think\nyou are going to do a great job.\nMr. Wallace. Well, thank you, both.\nI look forward to maybe even sitting here again sometime.\n[Laughter.]\nSenator Manchin. That is a guarantee.\nMr. Wallace. It would be twice now.\nThe Chairman. Well, Rob, thank you. Thank you for, again,\nyour willingness to serve.\nI think it is clear from the questions that you will enjoy\nstrong support within this Committee. I don't want to predict\nany outcomes, but my sense is that you hit it out of the park\ntoday, and we will be very pleased to be able to send your name\nforward to the Floor as soon as we are able to move you out of\nCommittee. And we look forward to doing that very, very soon.\nWe appreciate your willingness and that of your family to\nprovide that support. Fourteen-year-olds do come around. It\ntakes a little bit, so keep up your negotiation there.\nWith that, the Committee stands adjourned.\n[Whereupon, at 11:09 a.m. the hearing was adjourned.]\nAPPENDIX MATERIAL SUBMITTED\n----------\n[GRAPHICS IS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\n[all]",

Mike Crapo, Chairman of the\nCommittee, presiding.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN MIKE CRAPO\nChairman Crapo. This hearing will come to order.\nToday, June 4th, is the 30th anniversary of China's brutal\nCommunist Government authoritarian crackdown on unarmed\ncivilian protesters in Tiananmen Square, dashing a pro-\ndemocracy movement's highest hope for reforms.\nThat image of a young man standing in front of a row of\nrolling tanks is an indelible reminder of the true character\nand intentions of the Government in China that today is\npursuing Made in China 2025, the most ambitious, unorthodox\nindustrial policy program in the history of the world.\nThe Made in 2025 program aims to shift China's economy into\nhigher-value sectors such as those associated with robotics,\naerospace, and artificial intelligence, more generally.\nIn a very short span, Beijing has managed to transform\nitself from the perennial hope of being a cooperative trade\npartner to an all-out strategic competitor, in part to confront\nChina's industrial policy program, which, among other things,\nincludes subsidies for its domestic companies, developing\nadvanced semiconductors, the bedrock of all things today.\nWorse still, China is one of the United States' largest\ntrading partners, and it is in part pursuing that policy\nthrough a concept known as ``civil-military fusion,'' which is\nintended to provide the missing link between China's\ntechnological and military rise.\nWhile the United States pursued policies aimed to integrate\nChina into the global economic order, China persisted in\npredatory practices at home: to force American companies to\ndisgorge their technologies, to subsidize its own firms\ndomestically and their trade around the world, and otherwise\nthrow various roadblocks in front of foreign firms.\nToday's escalating trade and technology tensions can be\nseen as consequences of a Government that not only brutally\nrejected its own people's hope for reform 30 years ago, but has\nsince exploited the openness of a global economy and embarked\non its own brand of economic nationalism and technological\nsupremacy. This path, if unchecked, advantages not only Chinese\nfirms but can boost Chinese military strength at the same time.\nMore and more, U.S. national security grounds are called\nupon to confront threats to America's dominance in high-\ntechnology manufacturing and other threats from China.\nThe work of the Banking Committee, with its jurisdiction\nover banks, markets, export promotion, export controls, and\nreviews of foreign direct investment security and economic\nsanctions, sits at the intersection of U.S. national security,\nU.S. economic prosperity, and the global economy.\nToday the Committee will focus on three threats from China.\nThe first two threats arise from emerging national security\nissues associated with foreign investment in the United States\nand the export of critical technologies, particularly in the\nsemiconductor industry, which is a primary target for illicit\nacquisition.\nLast year, the Committee successfully negotiated and the\nPresident signed into law the Foreign Investment Risk Review\nModernization Act--FIRRMA--and the Export Control Reform Act.\nTogether, these bipartisan, bicameral pieces of legislation\nwork to enhance the Federal Government's authorities to protect\nAmerica against illicit foreign investments in, acquisitions\nof, and transfers of America's most sensitive technologies.\nToday the Committee will hear from a variety of\nperspectives on whether these new laws are sufficient to\ncounter China's threats or if other measures must be\nconsidered.\nOf particular interest is the question of how we separate\nand protect U.S. cutting-edge technology from the non-national\nsecurity-related trade that finances America's greatest\ninnovative achievements.\nThe third threat involves the illicit supply of fentanyl to\nthe United States, which is causing close to 38,000 American\ndeaths a year now. This question is if a set of sanctions tools\ncan be effectively leveraged to restrict the supply of illicit\nfentanyl into the United States.\nSenator Brown.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR SHERROD BROWN\nSenator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for calling this\nimportant hearing. Thank you for noting the 30th anniversary of\nTiananmen Square, as we remember those who fought for democracy\nand human rights as part of that movement.\nToday we focus on whether to provide the Administration\nwith new sanctions tools to complement existing Foreign\nNarcotics Kingpin sanctions, targeting traffickers in China,\nMexico, and elsewhere who contribute to the rising tide of\nillicit opioids coming into the U.S., including powerful new\nforms of fentanyl.\nLast month, China took the long overdue step of controlling\nthe full range of fentanyl analogs. This should mean that all\nforms of synthetic drugs which look and act like fentanyl will\nbe subject to China's drug control laws. I am glad China's\nGovernment took that step. Now we have to make sure they\nimplement and enforce it. As we know from watching Ohio's steel\nindustry, without strict enforcement, promises from China do\nnot mean very much.\nWe cannot wait to see whether China enforces its laws.\nFentanyl has become the leading cause of overdose deaths. On\naverage, in my State, more than any State in the country, 14\nOhioans die every single day due to an overdose. Those families\ncannot afford to wait and see whether China will enforce its\nrules.\nA recent Washington Post study found that the Ohio Valley\nin eastern Ohio, generally coinciding with the Appalachian part\nof Ohio, is suffering the most from the surge in overdose\ndeaths due to synthetic opioids. I ask consent, Mr. Chairman,\nto include the Washington Post article, entitled ``Fighting\nFentanyl''.\nChairman Crapo. Without objection.\nSenator Brown. Thank you.\nWe can bolster Chinese efforts by taking steps of our own\nto target traffickers. Our bipartisan Fentanyl Sanctions Act\nled by Senator Schumer would give the Administration new\nsanctions tools to help stem the tide. It would help provide\nintelligence and funding to keep these dangerous drugs out of\nOhio communities.\nWe will also address today the range of challenges posed by\nChina in export control, intellectual property theft,\ntechnology transfer, and certain foreign investments--including\nthrough China's massive Belt and Road Initiative, its Made in\nChina 2025 initiative, and targeted collaborative investments\nin U.S. firms with critical technologies that China seeks to\nacquire.\nWe must respond forcefully when China's ambitious and\nsometimes illegal acquisition strategies are deployed against\nU.S. firms, raising critical national security or economic\nsecurity questions here at home. This is what we did last year\nwhen we passed the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization\nAct--expanding and updating both CFIUS, the Committee on\nForeign Investment in the United States, and export control\nlaws.\nAlmost a year after enactment of these reforms, we will\nhear testimony that some foreign investors continue trying to\ncapture the intellectual property of leading-edge U.S.\ntechnology companies for their home country's military uses or,\nworse, to disrupt U.S. supply chains.\nOur current control systems attempt to prevent this type of\ntechnology transfer through multilateral and unilateral export\ncontrols. This system identifies dual-use products, technology,\nand software that may not be exported or is strictly limited.\nIs this approach still sufficient, when coupled with new\nconstraints on emerging and foundational technologies and other\nreforms contained in export control reforms enacted last year?\nIs the law being implemented as written?\nChina continues to use nontariff barriers to block foreign\nproducers from entering its market. Chinese State-owned\nenterprises, such as those in steel and other sectors, receive\nextensive Government subsidies that allow them to compete with\nno consideration of market forces. That makes it harder for\nU.S. companies and workers to compete--again, as our Ohio steel\nindustry knows too well.\nI do not think CFIUS and its investment review process can\nor should bear the burden of trying to bring about a fair\ntrading relationship with China. That is beyond its scope. It\nhas its hands full trying to police the national security\nthreats that some Chinese investments pose.\nBut as we know, much foreign investment in the United\nStates falls outside of the scope of CFIUS. We do not have a\ngood way to review it to make sure it is in our economic\ninterests as a Nation. It is not always easy to make a\ndistinction between national security and economic security.\nI have introduced legislation with Senator Grassley--the\nForeign Investment Review Act--that would require the Secretary\nof Commerce to review certain foreign investments, particularly\nthose made by State-owned enterprises, to make sure they are in\nthe long-term, strategic interests of American workers and\nAmerican companies.\nOther issues in our Committee's jurisdiction also need\nattention. Chairman Crapo and I have joined with Senators\nBaldwin, Cornyn, and 40 other sponsors on a bill to prohibit\nFederal funds from being used by transit agencies to purchase\nrail cars and buses manufactured by Chinese State-subsidized\ncompanies. Federal dollars should not support anticompetitive,\nheavily subsidized Chinese products that undermine our workers\nand threaten the future of U.S. automotive and rail\nmanufacturing. The bill also addresses cybersecurity risks\nfacing our Nation's transit systems.\nFinally, Mr. Chairman, our Committee must move quickly to\nprovide a long-term reauthorization to the Export-Import Bank.\nEach year, China's export credit agencies--get this--provide\nmore medium- and long-term investment support than the rest of\nthe world's export credit agencies combined. American\nmanufacturers need a reliable Export-Import Bank that is\nauthorized for the long term to stay competitive as they pursue\nbusiness abroad.\nIt is clear that on China we have lots of work to do.\nThanks to the witnesses.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you, Senator Brown.\nOur witnesses today will be:\nThe Honorable Kevin J. Wolf, the former Assistant Secretary\nof Commerce for the Export Administration in the Bureau of\nIndustry and Security, or BIS;\nMr. Scott Kennedy, Director of the Project on Chinese\nBusiness and Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and\nInternational Studies;\nAnd Mr. Richard Nephew, the former Principal Deputy\nCoordinator for Sanctions Policy at the U.S. Department of\nState. We welcome all of you with us today.\nEach of these witnesses is knowledgeable about U.S.\ncontrols and the aggressive role of China, drawing from their\nexperiences in industry, Government, and academia.\nI want to thank you again for your written testimony. It is\nvery helpful to us and will be made a part of the record. I\nalso want to remind you that we have a 5-minute rule on your\noral testimony. Please pay attention to that so there will be\ntime for our Senators, who have their own 5-minute rule, and I\nask them to pay attention to that.\nWith that, Mr. Wolf, please begin.\nSTATEMENT OF KEVIN WOLF, FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF COMMERCE\nFOR EXPORT ADMINISTRATION, BUREAU OF INDUSTRY AND SECURITY,\nDEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE\nMr. Wolf. Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and other\nMembers of the Committee, thank you for inviting me today. The\nviews I express are my own. I am not advocating for or on\nbehalf of any particular law or regulation on behalf of\nanother. Rather, as requested, I am here to answer your\nquestions with respect to existing laws and regulations.\nThis is a very serious topic. The United States never wants\nto be in a fair fight with an adversary, and the appropriate,\naggressively enforced, clearly written, and well-funded export\ncontrols are an important part of that tool. They are also a\nvery important tool in our foreign policy, particularly\nincluding with respect to achieving include human rights\nobjectives.\nI have never subscribed to the view that export controls\nshould ``balance'' between our national security and foreign\npolicy objectives and economic and trade policy. National\nsecurity objectives and foreign policy, including human rights\nobjectives, stand on their own merit and should never be traded\noff for a particular transaction.\nThat said, it is vital that export controls be tailored to\nspecific, identifiable, clear national security and foreign\npolicy objectives; otherwise, if you have overbroad or\nuncertain controls, it ends up doing more harm than good to the\nvery thing that we are trying to protect, which is the U.S.\nindustrial base. And for the U.S. to be a global leader, we\nabsolutely need to have access to markets worldwide.\nWith respect to China, the issues pertaining to dual-use\ncontrols, items that have commercial and military applications,\nare among the hardest intellectually and from a policy\nperspective to decide and implement and have been for decades.\nWhile as you mentioned it is one of our largest trading\npartners, there are obviously significant issues with respect\nto internal diversion of commercial items for military\napplications.\nWith respect to military or commercial satellite and space-\nrelated items, oddly enough, the analysis is really quite easy\nbecause particularly since Tiananmen, there are some very\nclear, absolute statutory and regulatory embargoes and very\nclear national security and foreign policy reasons for them.\nWhen it comes down to, thus, deciding what the right level\nof control is on a dual-use item, it ultimately boils down to\nhow you define ``national security.'' The traditional\ndefinition is to have the national security experts go to those\nitems that provide us with military or intelligence advantage\nfor commercial items and then to work backward from those very\nclear, specific identified threats to determine which\ncommercial items feed into that, identify them, and then work\nwith our international allies so that they impose similar\ncontrols as well to enhance the effectiveness of the control,\nregulate them in a very clear, interagency process, and then\nenforce violations in order to motivate or compel compliance.\nAnother definition of ``national security'' is to see China\nas such as a per se economic threat. Its very economic\nexistence in competition with U.S. companies creates the\nnational security threat, and as such, aggressive controls\nshould be imposed on the transfers of technology that lead\ninto, for example, everything identified in 2025.\nSo without arguing about either particular perspective or a\ndefinition of ``national security,'' what I hope to be able to\ndo today is to give you my perspective of having worked in this\narea for about 25 years and what, regardless of your worldview\nis or approach or issue with respect to China, is the key to\neffective controls, which is clarity, certainty, and\nmultilateralism. Because if you do not have clear controls or\nif they are uncertain or if you go it alone, all you eventually\ndo is end up hurting the very sector of the economy or the\nobjectives that you are trying to enhance. And the best way now\nto do that is with the Export Control Reform Act that you\nreferred to earlier. It is a very good piece of bipartisan\nlegislation. The career staff and others at the Bureau of\nIndustry and Security are still writing implementing\nregulations, and as described in my written testimony, I put in\na big plug for more support, more resources, and more oversight\nof the very clear standards in that statute that this Bureau is\ngoing to be implementing.\nAnd as noted, I have a 3-minute, a 30-minute, a 3-hour, and\na 3-day version of each topic. So I am going to stop there and\nleave the rest to your questions.\nThank you very much.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you very much, Mr. Wolf.\nMr. Kennedy.\nSTATEMENT OF SCOTT KENNEDY, SENIOR ADVISER, FREEMAN CHAIR IN\nCHINA STUDIES, AND DIRECTOR, PROJECT ON CHINESE BUSINESS AND\nPOLITICAL ECONOMY, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL\nSTUDIES\nMr. Kennedy. Thank you very much, Chairman Crapo, Ranking\nMember Brown, and the Committee, to talk about the commercial\nrelationship with China and both the national security and\neconomic challenges that we face and how we should respond.\nCertainly this being the 30th anniversary of the Beijing\nmassacre reminds us of the challenges and the long road that we\nhave to follow, and also as someone working on China for all of\nthat time and longer, taking an approach of principled\npragmatism, being principled about what we want to achieve but\nalso pragmatic and effective.\nChina's efforts in high-tech I think you already summed up\npretty well, and I do not need to go into much detail. But they\nare driven by commercial motivations, domestic security, what\nthey can do to keep the Communist Party in power, and national\nsecurity. And their goal is simply leadership in every\nindustry.\nThe list, not just Made in China 2025 but their 13th Five-\nYear Plan, has hundreds of industries they want to achieve\ndominance in, and this is a threat to the U.S. and others, not\nbecause of China's goals necessarily, but the way they want to\nachieve them with massive Government and party intervention.\nAnd the business model is simple: Throw as much money as you\ncan, scale up as fast as you can, do not worry about the\nlosses, and then once you get market share and you lose, you\nknow, competitors, you will be successful. That is maybe a good\napproach for China if you do not care about the price tag, but\nit is horrible for these industries and for their competitors\nand supply chain, so it has huge commercial and national\nsecurity relevance for us, not just because of China's strategy\nbut because of its scale.\nBut I think one thing I want to emphasize is that China has\ngot a very mixed performance record on this strategy. Overall,\nChina is much more innovative than it was in the past. It ranks\n17th amongst countries in the world in terms of its innovation\ncapacity, which separates it from other developing countries\nand makes it closer to advanced industrialized economies. The\nU.S. is ranked 6th now, Germany 9th, South Korea 12th, Japan\n13th.\nAt the same time, there is lots of variation. In some\nindustries the Chinese are amazingly successful. In some places\nthey are flops. China has obviously made huge strides in\ntelecom and pharma through having a mostly privatized,\nglobalized industry. Some of that is through real hard work,\nand some of it is through theft. In other areas, they have had\nsuccesses which are generating huge, huge problems--electric\ncars, solar, wind, robotics, massive overcapacity that\nthreatens those industries globally.\nAnd then there are failures--commercial aircraft,\nsemiconductors--where they are spending hundreds of billions,\nwasting money and distracting the rest of the global industry,\nand these are serious problems. But they do not have--the\nresults vary significantly.\nI want to say a couple things about American policy, and\nthen I look forward to the conversation.\nSome of the things that we are doing I think make total\nsense. China has been dragging its feet on meeting its WTO\ncommitments. We have been overly patient for far too long. And\nso I have been a grudging supporter of tariffs. I was a\nsupporter of the reforms for foreign investment and export\ncontrols, I think also long overdue. But I also think we need\nto recognize that we are losing focus on what the overall goal\nis and where the Trump administration at least is becoming so\nfocused on the tool of unilateral pressure that it has lost\nfocus on what the outcome should be. The outcome should not\npreferably be just simply disengagement and moving along with a\nnew cold war. Instead, it should be finding a way to level the\nplaying field, find a way to peacefully coexist.\nNow, of course, that cannot be guaranteed. The Chinese have\nto respond. But we should use the best tactics we can to\nachieve that. The strategy of only relying on unilateral\npressure is causing a lot of collateral damage in the United\nStates and elsewhere. And so I would just reinforce what my\ncolleague Mr. Wolf said about what our strategy should be,\nwhich we should stop bashing our allies, threatening tariffs\nwith them; collaborate with them both on defense and offense,\nso multilateralizing investment controls, export controls;\nworking with them on multilateral solutions; reforming the WTO;\nand then something we have not talked much about, which is\nstrengthening the U.S.' own innovation ecosystem. Regardless of\nwhat the Chinese are doing, we need to do that, and I have got\nspecific suggestions in each of these areas that I am happy to\nshare with you during the discussion.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you, Mr. Kennedy.\nMr. Nephew.\nSTATEMENT OF RICHARD NEPHEW, FORMER PRINCIPAL DEPUTY\nCOORDINATOR FOR SANCTIONS POLICY, DEPARTMENT OF STATE\nMr. Nephew. Thank you, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member\nBrown, and other distinguished Members of this Committee, for\ninviting me to speak here today.\nThe scope of this Committee's inquiry today is much broader\nthan the Fentanyl Sanctions Act or, for that matter, the use of\nsanctions in general in addressing policy differences with\nChina. But it is a privilege to offer my thoughts with respect\nto this specific set of issues. I am also honored to join my\nfellow panelists here today who have such long experience in\nissues germane to this Committee's consideration, and like\nthem, I should note that my comments here reflect my own views\nand not any of the institutions with which I am affiliated.\nI think the decision to explore sanctions as a possible\nmeans of securing additional leverage to manage the supply of\nfentanyl to the United States--and sanctions' active use in\nother foreign policy contexts with China--is fitting due to the\nestablished utility of sanctions in managing other policy\nproblems. As I have written about extensively since I left\nGovernment in 2015, sanctions can be an effective tool. But\nthey should neither be the only nor the dominant tool in\nmanaging every foreign policy problem. There are real dangers\nin the overuse of sanctions and in the reduction of U.S. policy\ninterests with key countries--China foremost among them--to\nsanctions management exercises.\nI am particularly grateful the Committee has decided to\nstudy and debate this issue rather than leap immediately into\nthe business of applying sanctions against entities in China\nor, for that matter, any other country in which there are\nentities involved in fentanyl trafficking.\nThat concern notwithstanding, and acknowledging that my\nopinion is only in the context of sanctions design rather than\nas an expert in fentanyl, I do think the Fentanyl Sanctions Act\nis an appropriate step forward in the redress of our concerns\nwith China in this regard.\nIn my written testimony, I offer specific thoughts with\nrespect to the provisions of the FSA and the diplomatic\nstrategy it would support. Let me say here that in my view it\nhas sound, clearly articulated objectives. It offers a flexible\napproach that provides substantial discretion to the executive\nbranch. It provides for proportional and limited sanctions and\nin a manner that is distinct from but complementary to the\nexisting sanctions structure, including the Kingpin Act. It can\nfacilitate a diplomatic approach, especially in that it is not\nlimited solely to China as a target. And it is complemented by\nother steps--including the creation of a commission,\nestablishment of an intelligence program dedicated to the\nproblem, and the provision of funding--that can help to create\na ``whole of Government'' approach.\nThere are three challenges or concerns that do need to be\nconsidered in the context of the FSA. They are:\nFirst, the reality that the U.S.-China relationship is\nalready very complicated. Adding FSA measures to the mix may\nmake it harder to address our broader array of interests with\nChina. In my opinion, though, the limited scope and scale of\nthe FSA and the fact that this issue is already on the agenda\nmitigates some of this risk. But it is an important one to\nacknowledge.\nSecond, the United States has a lot of sanctions in place\nalready that affect Chinese interests. From Iran to human\nrights to Russia, our sanctions plate with China is full. One\ncan reasonably argue that this will only reinforce Chinese\nreluctance to cooperate with any part of our sanctions since\ntheir demands are, in their view, never-ending. Some Chinese\nscholars are also already starting to advocate retaliatory\nsanctions measures.\nThat said, in my view, this only argues in favor of being\nmore careful in our sanctions approach, picking and choosing\nwhich sanctions to create and how to enforce them. If the U.S.\nGovernment prioritizes fentanyl trafficking, then in my view it\ncan and should make space for this issue and its approach to\nother sanctions matters.\nThird, there is the risk of contributing to the sanctions\noveruse problem. In my view, this is a very real concern and\none that might in time affect U.S. economic performance and\naccess. It is not, however, likely to be triggered by this one\nmeasure. I do believe that the overuse problem needs\nexamination, and I commend those on Capitol Hill who are\nbeginning to mull options to do just that, through reporting\nrequirements and even commissions to study the issue.\nIn sum, though I believe there are legitimate questions\nabout the FSA, I believe that it is a reasonable next step to\ntake in our efforts to redress our concerns regarding the\nsupply of fentanyl to this country. The sanctions proposed are\nproportional, reasonable, subject to executive discretion,\nconsistent with the diplomatic approach, and manageable in the\noverall policy context. In an ideal world, no sanctions\nmeasures included in the FSA would ever need to be used, as\ntheir mere existence would contribute momentum to ongoing\ndiplomatic efforts to confront the challenge of illicit\nfentanyl trade. And even if sanctions had to be imposed, I\nbelieve there are mechanisms in the FSA to manage their\ndeleterious impacts as well as to provide relief in the context\nof future diplomatic progress.\nI appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today and\noffer my testimony. I look forward to your questions.\nThank you.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you very much, Mr. Nephew, and I\nappreciate the comments that each of you have already made.\nOne thing that was, I think, a common theme among each of\nyou was that sanctions are an effective tool and that we need\nto be careful to use them with precision. And they are not a\nblunt instrument. To me, this is a lesson that we learned here\nin the Committee as we tried to work through FIRRMA and the\nExport Control Act reforms that we did last Congress on a\nbipartisan basis.\nThe question that I want to focus on here is: How do we do\nthat? And I am primarily--you know, Mr. Kennedy, you said there\nwere hundreds of industries where China is seeking to basically\nleapfrog itself into global dominance. I want to focus on the\nsemiconductor industry, which I believe is one of the most\nsignificant ones that is currently under direct threat. And the\nfirst question I have is: For the U.S. companies in the\nsemiconductor industry to maintain what I believe they\ncurrently have as a dominant lead, but for them to maintain\ntheir position in developing and leading in cutting-edge\ntechnologies, do we not have to make sure that they have access\nto global markets? I assume that is an easy answer, but go\nahead.\nMr. Kennedy. Yes, I appreciate the first one being a\nsoftball. American companies are leaders in all aspects of\nsemiconductors, and we should be exporting them. It is a huge\npart of the industry, not just because China and other places\nare the end consumers but also because of global supply chains,\nand if you--obviously, you need--in the context of the Chinese,\nthey are throwing hundreds of billions of subsidies at these\nindustries, and they are trying to steal this technology. You\nhave to guard against that as much as you can. But you also\nhave to keep your industry healthy, so investing in R&D,\nkeeping these markets open.\nIf those markets are closed off for whatever reason, then\nit is going to be the Chinese investing and building their\nsupply chain now. They are very far behind, and they have a\nlong way to go. But if we just pull up the drawbridge too\nquickly, then what they are going to do is eventually they will\nfigure out how to make a semiconductor, and that will be\ndangerous for our industry and our national security.\nChairman Crapo. Well, as a matter of fact, wouldn't it be\nthe case that if we use this tool wrongly or ineffectively, we\nwould actually advantage China's movement into the\nsemiconductor position that it is seeking to achieve?\nMr. Wolf. Absolutely. I agree with everything you said and\nwhat was just said a moment ago. If we, as a matter of both law\nand psychology, encourage buyers to want to go and dual source\nfrom outside of the United States, then that reduces the amount\nof ability of U.S. companies to invest in R&D to stay ahead\nwith respect to the next generation and be the world leader\nfrom the United States. And so U.S. companies absolutely need\naccess to all markets, both as a matter of law and psychology,\nand that these tools that we all--we did not coordinate, but we\nall were basically saying the same thing, is do not overuse\nthem in order to avoid spooking potential buyers and\novercontrolling that which does not need to be controlled. So I\nagree with everything you said in your question.\nChairman Crapo. So let me just conclude with a more\nspecific point here and ask your comment on this. I very\nstrongly support both ZTE and Huawei being put on the entity\nlist and having the sanctions that we have begun implementing\nagainst them.\nAt the same time, I am concerned that if we utilize the\nsanctions in this context without the precision that we need,\nwe could actually benefit China by losing our market share for\nour semiconductor industry or weakening it badly and then\nallowing other suppliers, not necessarily Chinese suppliers but\nother suppliers, to take over U.S. markets and ultimately\nfacilitate China's objective in this very field.\nI would just like any of you to jump in on that if you\nwould like. Mr. Kennedy.\nMr. Kennedy. Yeah, I would agree. Although I have been\nsupportive of some of the unilateral measures the\nAdministration has taken and also the efforts to increase our\ndefenses across these industries, I think the entities list\naction was taken prematurely and is too broad. So I probably\nwould have waited some time before I went forward with that\nstep because of the huge consequences it can have, and then I\nwould--if you end up having to implement it, I would have\ntailored it much more closely. So there are elements of\nHuawei's business in consumer electronic cell phones which are\nnot the type of threat that they could be, for example, in base\nstations for 5G. So I think I would have been much more\nspecific in how I would have targeted it if I had gotten there,\nbut I probably would not be there at this point because it is\nreally having a huge effect on the overall trajectory of the\nrelationship and the negotiation, so I think we would have--I\nwould have preferred greater coordination about that decision.\nChairman Crapo. Well, thank you. And, Mr. Nephew and Mr.\nWolf, my time is up. I do want your answers to this, so if you\nwould give them to me in writing following this.\nMr. Wolf. Pretty much what you said I agree with, so that\nis the short answer.\nChairman Crapo. All right. Thank you.\nSenator Brown.\nSenator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you all\nfor shedding light on the importance of sanctions and the\nlimitations and the importance of precision on how we apply\nthem. I do not want to overstate their power, but I want to\nexplore with you, Mr. Nephew, to understand better sort of how\nthis plays out.\nWhat do you see the major targets of sanctions,\nparticularly on targeting fentanyl, what do you see the major\ntargets, Chinese chemical companies who look the other way,\npharmaceutical companies whose employees may be engaged in\nthese lucrative crimes, individual traffickers? Talk to me\nabout how that should go.\nMr. Nephew. Yes, Senator, I think you have listed actually\nall the ones that I would imagine would be on the list. It\nwould be those companies and those entities that are either\ndeliberately or with malice of ignorance allowing for their\ngoods to be transferred to the United States. And I think there\nis a range of companies, both pharmaceutical companies and\nchemical companies, that could be potentially targeted. But\nthere are also, you know, those involved in the shipping and\nthe transfer and the transiting of goods as well, especially\nnot just to the United States directly but also to third-party\nor third-destination countries that could potentially be used\nto transfer to the United States as well.\nBut, importantly, I should say, I do not see that as being\nthe first step of implementation of the FSA. My sense of this\nis that we would take the existence of the FSA, if it were to\nbecome law, and to use it in a diplomatic approach with the\nChinese where we would identify to them specific areas where we\nhave concerns, including specific companies, as we have done\nwith nuclear proliferation, missile proliferation, and other\nsuch things, and to expect them and ask them to take action on\ntheir own. And to me, it is those incorrigibles that the\nChinese are unable or unwilling to address that we would then\neventually have to impose sanctions against.\nSenator Brown. OK. Thank you for that thoughtful answer.\nMr. Wolf and Mr. Kennedy, let me shift to another issue.\nChinese State-owned rail car manufacturers use low-ball bids to\nwin four major contracts to supply subway and commuter rail\nvehicles to transit systems, to large transit systems in large\ncities. That company wants to sell up to 800 subway cars to the\nD.C. Metro system, a public contract that would be worth\nupwards of $1 billion. A major Chinese electric vehicle\nmanufacturer that has received generous support from its\nGovernment has sold electric buses to U.S. transit agencies in\n13 States. Chairman Crapo and I are working with three dozen\ncolleagues on legislation to prohibit Federal grants from DOT\nfrom supporting contracts with these Chinese subsidized\ncompanies. Is that the right approach, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Wolf?\nMr. Kennedy. I guess what I would encourage is being as\nspecific as you can to stop the problem that you see. So in the\ncase of companies that are State-supported or State-owned, we\nhave rules already. We can use countervailing duties. If they\nhave captured so much market share that they are abusing their\ndominant position, you can use antitrust rules.\nSo there are ways, if you are sure what they are doing is\ngiving them an unfair advantage, to be very targeted. State-\nowned enterprises obviously are very difficult. It would be\nnice if we had global rules related to State-owned enterprises\nin particular, either at the WTO, or, you know, the TPP has\nthose. But if those did not work, then the methods that you\npropose might be a good next step.\nMr. Wolf. I agree it would be an effective tool, and one of\nmy main themes is that export controls and CFIUS are not the\nsolution to all problems, and when other areas of law do not\naddress the issue that you just described, then new ones need\nto be created. So, yes, I agree.\nSenator Brown. OK. I did not know I would have a minute\nleft. Let me shift back to the fentanyl issue with Mr. Kennedy,\nand from Mr. Nephew's response on fentanyl, that you go to the\nGovernment first and you give them that opportunity, if you\nwill, to, for want of a better term, behave better, are you\nhopeful, Mr. Kennedy, the decision in early May to treat as\ncontrolled substances under their law to treat fentanyl will be\neffective in the way perhaps that Mr. Nephew suggested we\nfollow through?\nMr. Kennedy. Had we continued on a path to reach a broad\ntrade agreement and stabilize the relationship, yes,\ncautiously. With that increasingly unlikely, I am very\npessimistic that we will make much progress because of the\nbroader change in the atmosphere of the relationship.\nSenator Brown. OK.\nChairman Crapo. Senator Toomey.\nSenator Toomey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I also want to\nthank our witnesses.\nI just want to make a quick observation following up on a\npoint that Mr. Kennedy made in his opening comments, and Mr.\nKennedy rightly, in my mind, reminded us of the massive scale\nof mal-investment and misallocation of capital that happens in\nthe Chinese economy precisely because it is a managed economy.\nIt is not a truly free economy. And so the smartest people in\nthe world are never going to figure out exactly where capital\nshould go, exactly where resources should go. Markets discover\nthat far better than any committee, and if that were not true,\nthen the socialist economies of the world would have long ago\nsurpassed ours.\nSo while China is a very serious threat in many important\nways, I just hope we will remember that this power that they\nexercise is actually a weakness for their overall economic\nperformance. And our greatest strength is not the head start\nthat we have in modernization but, rather, the relative freedom\nthat we have and the ability to discover how to allocate\ncapital through a market mechanism.\nI would like to switch back to the discussion about\nfentanyl as well. It is stunning to me just how powerful this\ndrug is, and I will give you one illustration that was mind-\nblowing for me. In June of 2017, so 2 years ago, the U.S.\nCustoms and Border Patrol seized 110 pounds of fentanyl at the\nport of Philadelphia. One hundred and ten pounds. Now, that is\nabout the weight of a relatively large German shepherd. It is\nenough fentanyl to kill every man, woman, and child in\nPennsylvania twice. That is how powerful this is. And like\nOhio, Pennsylvania has experienced a huge surge in the number\nof opioid deaths that are directly attributable to fentanyl. So\nI am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Fentanyl\nSanctions Act.\nI have also introduced legislation with Senator Jones that\nis a little bit different, but it goes after the same problem.\nIt is called the ``Blocking Deadly Fentanyl Imports Act''.\nCurrently, the Foreign Assistance Act forbids most forms of\nU.S. foreign aid to countries if they are not assisting our\nefforts sufficiently in block illicit substances. There is a\nspecific list of these substances. It is heroin, marijuana,\ncocaine, methamphetamine and its precursor chemicals, but\nfentanyl is not on the list. And I think that is because the\nlist has not been updated as it should be. So our bill would\nsimply update that list to include fentanyl, so I have just got\na couple of questions about this.\nOne, to start with, for Mr. Kennedy, some experts on\nChinese behavior are concerned that China may lack the capacity\nto enforce its fentanyl controls, and others think that maybe\nit is convenient for China to use fentanyl as an issue that\ngives them some leverage over the U.S. in other areas. Can you\ngive us your thoughts on the extent of the Chinese Government's\ncapacity to enforce its own broadening? As you know, recently\nthey banned the entire class of fentanyl and not just a\ndiscrete list of analogs. That is a step in the right\ndirection, but could you address their ability to properly\nenforce this?\nMr. Kennedy. I think it is difficult for anyone to enforce\nit when it is that small and that powerful. Right? So it is\nlike diamonds in your pocket. It is that level of problem. And\ngiven the size of China, yes, it is difficult. But the Chinese\nhave shown in so many other areas that when they have political\nwill to do something, they are able to make progress, if not\nfix a problem.\nSo I think the question is: What is their incentive in the\nbroader relationship so that they can put more resources toward\nthis problem? This is the same issue in intellectual property\nrights, in many other areas. Given the proper incentives, they\nwill change their behavior. If this is just a capacity problem,\nwe certainly have the ways to collaborate with them, also with\nMexico and others, because this is not just a U.S.-China\nproblem, even though a lot of this stuff originates in China.\nSenator Toomey. And then for anyone on the panel, does\neverybody agree or does someone disagree with the premise of\nthe Blocking Deadly Fentanyl Imports, with the idea that\nfentanyl is as dangerous or more dangerous than the existing\nlist of drugs and, therefore, fentanyl should be added to the\nregime under the Foreign Assistance Act? Any opinions on that?\nMr. Nephew. So I will just say, you know, as someone\nspeaking to the fentanyl issue, I do think that tends to make\nsense. I would see no reason why it would not. Again, I think\nthat this is a broader conversation for experts in drug\ntrafficking and fentanyl specifically, but I see no reason why\nthat would not make sense, sir.\nSenator Toomey. Any disagreement?\n[No response.]\nSenator Toomey. All right. Thank you very much, Mr.\nChairman.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you.\nSenator Menendez.\nSenator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nLet me continue along the line of this question on\nfentanyl, and I would like to ask Mr. Nephew, with your\nexperience coordinating U.S. sanctions, can you speak to how\nthe United States can best use its sanction authorities to\ncombat international opioid trafficking? And what is your\nassessment? Does the U.S. have sufficient authorities under our\nkingpin sanctions to tackle illicit opioid trafficking? Or are\nnew authorities needed to hold accountable Chinese companies\ninvolved in fentanyl trafficking?\nMr. Nephew. Thank you, Senator. So I would say two things.\nFirst, I think that were the Fentanyl Sanctions Act to\nbecome law, I could see it being part of an integrated strategy\nof both intelligence collection, analysis, and identification\nof targets, that that would then facilitate diplomatic\nengagement with the Chinese to see if they can be convinced or\ncompelled to implement their own laws when it comes to the\nregulation of fentanyl, and then failing that, along the lines\nof the schedule of reports that is outlined in the FSA to\nimpose sanctions against those that either are unwilling or\nunable to be corrected by the Chinese Government.\nAnd I think this speaks to the second issue, which is the\nKingpin Act. To me the Kingpin Act is very valuable. It allows\nyou to impose very significant and substantial sanctions on\nnarcotics traffickers, and I think the fact it has been used at\nleast once with respect to fentanyl is useful. But I do think\nthat having more authorities, especially at the lower scale of\npunishment, may be valuable. And I think that is where the FSA\nis so useful because it adds new tools. It adds sanctions\nagainst import-export financing. It adds, you know, sanctions\non visas for senior officials. It would give the U.S.\nGovernment more tools to apply against some of these companies\nand entities, which I think may be more effective as part of a\ndiplomatic approach, and especially the fact that there are\nmeans for tailoring implementation of sanctions in the long\nterm for countries that are cooperating. I think that also\nadds.\nSenator Menendez. I appreciate that insight. I hope we can\nget the Fentanyl Sanctions Act passed. I have sponsored it with\nSenator Schumer. I think there is not a part of our country\nthat is not touched by this issue, and every tool that we can\nuse to prevent fentanyl from coming into the United States in\nthe first place I think is incredibly important.\nI would like to ask Mr. Kennedy, as I look at China now 30\nyears after Tiananmen Square, I see an Orwellian State. Xi\nJinping has obviously developed one of the most sophisticated\ntechnological surveillance systems of its people in Xinjiang,\nobviously, with the Uighurs. How should we be balancing our\nvalues such as concerns about human rights in Xinjiang and\nAmerican companies that are engaged in selling surveillance and\nsecurity goods and services to China, especially when we see\nChina promoting that very essence of that technology to other\ncountries in the world to repress people as well?\nMr. Kennedy. I agree it is a huge problem. Chinese people\ndo not have middle names, but if they did, Xi Jinping's would\nbe ``Control''. Every problem he sees he wants to solve with\nincreasing control, whether it is technological, economic,\nevery element of State power. And I think it is really\nimportant that American companies not blindly serve, to the\nextent possible, any of those kinds of goals and that use of\nparty power.\nIt may be that we need legal restrictions on participating,\nand I think that is certainly--we have some of those already.\nIn addition, public--shining lights on these companies that are\ninvolved could also be involved--but I think it also needs to\nbe multilateral, and we need to be relatively consistent to the\nextent that we can on a range of Chinese behaviors, not just in\nXinjiang but otherwise, and through our own actions show that\nwe are not just picking on the Chinese because they are the\nChinese, but because we care about human rights everywhere in\nthe world across people of all faiths.\nSenator Menendez. And, last, given that the President has\nannounced that he is going to impose across-the-board tariffs\non Mexico, the second largest market in the world for U.S.\ngoods and services, as we are starting the process for\nratification of USMCA and Mexico just started their\nratification process, as we are trying to deal with China and\nits unfair trade practices, what message does that send to\nChina that even if they strike a deal with us, then the\nPresident goes ahead and says, ``Well, I am going to strike\ntariffs on you for some other reason''?\nMr. Kennedy. The biggest reason China wanted a deal was\nthat they thought it would stabilize the relationship. But they\ndo not want a deal if they feel on day two we will break our\nword. And they also feel that if we are isolated because we are\nhitting everyone else with tariffs and penalties, that it will\nbe us that are isolated at the end of this, and they will just\nwait out the President until the next Administration.\nSenator Menendez. Thank you.\nChairman Crapo. Senator Kennedy.\nSenator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you,\ngentlemen, for your testimony.\nMr. Kennedy, if I referred to ``controlled technology,''\nwould you understand that term?\nMr. Kennedy. If you could explain just a little bit?\nSenator Kennedy. Well, it is important technology,\nimportant to the Nation's commerce and the Nation's defense. Do\nwe have university students, citizens of foreign countries,\nChina, for example, in our universities that have access to\ncontrolled technology?\nMr. Kennedy. Well, there are laws governing Federal grants\nto universities, and as far as I understand, in many\ncircumstances there are supposed to be restrictions to access\nto those technologies in the lab and----\nSenator Kennedy. I think it is called a ``deemed export\nlicense.''\nMr. Kennedy. Yes, yes.\nSenator Kennedy. But if you have a university student who\nis just in the lab, just present, a deemed export license is\nnot required. Is that not the case?\nMr. Kennedy. That is correct.\nSenator Kennedy. Are there foreign university students,\nuniversity students in our universities from foreign countries\nlike China that are stealing our technology, controlled\ntechnology?\nMr. Kennedy. Well, there are 369,000 students from China in\nAmerican universities.\nSenator Kennedy. It is the most in the world, isn't it?\nMr. Kennedy. Yes, by far. You know, at least half----\nSenator Kennedy. And many of them are in the sciences, are\nthey not?\nMr. Kennedy. That is right, in science technology----\nSenator Kennedy. And many of them are in labs that are\ndeveloping controlled technology, are they not? But as long as\nthey are just there observing, we do not require a deemed\nexport license, do we? Do you know, Mr. Wolf?\nMr. Wolf. Well, it is actually the area of law I used to be\nresponsible for, and the laws apply equally whether you are a\nstudent or in a university with nonpublic technical information\nthat is controlled or in a company. And a release of technology\nto that student that is not in the public domain requires a\nlicense the same way as exporting to----\nSenator Kennedy. Yeah, but if they are just there--they are\njust in the lab.\nMr. Wolf. Yes.\nSenator Kennedy. It is not considered a release, is it?\nMr. Wolf. No, actually, it is. The revealing of information\nin any context, orally or visually, is a controlled event,\nassuming it is not public and on the Internet to be available\nto anybody.\nSenator Kennedy. So you are telling me that if a student is\nmerely in the lab, our universities are not getting deemed\nexport licenses?\nMr. Wolf. The act of revealing to a foreign person in a\nuniversity setting or any other settings is a controlled event\nwith controlled technology.\nSenator Kennedy. I do not agree with you.\nMr. Wolf. OK.\nSenator Kennedy. I think the deemed export license is being\napplied very narrowly, and there are a lot of universities that\nare not obtaining them. And I have got a bill to do something\nabout that to tighten that up.\nMr. Wolf. OK.\nSenator Kennedy. Do you see any problems with that\nlegislation?\nMr. Wolf. I was unaware of it until just now, but I would\nbe happy to look at it and discuss it with you and provide\nhowever much help I could.\nSenator Kennedy. All right. Let me ask you this, gentlemen:\nThe law obviously in China is underdeveloped and many law firms\nare underdeveloped. But we have seen a growing occurrence of\nforeign law firms, law firms foreign to China, who are\naffiliating with Chinese law firms. Are they covered by CFIUS\nif they are an American law firm affiliating with a Chinese law\nfirm?\nMr. Wolf. If it does not involve an investment in a U.S.\nbusiness, then no.\nSenator Kennedy. Well, the reason we have CFIUS is to keep\nChina and other countries--I do not mean to pick on China--from\ntaking our technology. Correct?\nMr. Wolf. And other things, yes.\nSenator Kennedy. Right. Well, if an American law firm is\naffiliating with, let us say, a Chinese law firm and that\nChinese law firm has access through the American law firm to\nAmerican technology, why doesn't CFIUS cover it?\nMr. Wolf. Well, the export control rules would prohibit the\nrelease of controlled technology by a lawyer----\nSenator Kennedy. It does not apply to law firms.\nMr. Wolf. Actually, it does. It applies to anybody moving\ninformation across the border. There is not an exclusion for a\nlawyer to provide controlled technology.\nSenator Kennedy. Well, when Dentons--Dentons is now the\nlargest law firm in the world. They just gobbled up an Atlanta\nfirm. Dentons merged--I do not think you can merge in China,\nbut affiliated with a large Chinese law firm. They did not get\na deemed export license.\nMr. Wolf. I do not know anything about that, but it would\ndepend upon whether controlled technology was being provided to\na foreign person.\nSenator Kennedy. It is not being provided. I am saying that\nthe foreign law firm, foreign to the United States, the Chinese\nlaw firm that has access to the data of the law firm can access\nthe American technology.\nMr. Wolf. OK.\nSenator Kennedy. Is CFIUS being applied to that?\nMr. Wolf. Well, CFIUS is focused on the investment and the\nexport control----\nSenator Kennedy. I get that. I get that. But before the\nmerger between the American law firm and the Chinese law firm,\nis the American law firm coming to CFIUS and saying, ``Is this\nOK?''\nMr. Wolf. Probably not, but I would love to discuss this\nmore with you. It is a new fact pattern to me that I have not\nthought about until today.\nSenator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Crapo. Senator Tester.\nSenator Tester. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member\nBrown, for holding this hearing. I want to thank you all for\nyour testimony.\nI want to just touch on what Senator Kennedy said. Is it\nfairly common knowledge that in the university and the private\nsector, whether you have a fellow or a student in the lab\ndealing with controlled information, that that controlled\ninformation cannot be transferred? Is that fairly common\nknowledge?\nMr. Wolf. I would hope so, yes.\nSenator Tester. OK.\nMr. Wolf. Whether it is enforced is a different question,\nbut the rules regarding deemed export apply to a national of\nthat country the same way as the technology going to the home\ncountry.\nSenator Tester. I think Senator Kennedy brings up a good\npoint. In fact, if they do not know about it and it is the law,\nwe ought to figure it out pretty darn quick. And if they do\nknow about it, then it is there.\nI just want to--there are a lot of different ways to go\nhere today, and I just appreciate you all being here. Huawei is\non the Department of Commerce's entity list, so you know the\nrules that go around that. And this is for Mr. Wolf or Mr.\nKennedy or anybody. What impacts does this listing have on\nHuawei's business operations? Is that listing significant to\nthem?\nMr. Wolf. Oh, it is dramatic because an entity listing\nprohibits the export of anything from the United States,\nwhether it is a semiconductor or----\nSenator Tester. Got it. And one of you brought up, if not\nmore than one of you brought up, the fact--I think it was Mr.\nKennedy brought up we have got to quick bashing our allies and\nworking together and this has got to be a multilateral\noperation. So I am not sure that the other folks see it the\nsame way I do that are our allies in the world. Let us just be\nfrank. Can it be steered through a third country, third-party\ncountry, so they can still get what they need?\nMr. Wolf. Well, the prohibitions apply to U.S.-origin items\nanywhere around the world.\nSenator Tester. OK.\nMr. Wolf. So if a foreign company were transferring U.S.-\norigin items, that is still illegal to a listed entity.\nSenator Tester. OK. Mr. Kennedy.\nMr. Kennedy. There are certain technologies which only\nAmerican companies have, which they cannot get from anywhere\nelse, and so if faithfully implemented across the board, this\ncould be potentially fatal to Huawei, and not just Huawei as a\ncompany but all the networks that are currently running on\nHuawei equipment. So it is going to degrade those networks in\nthe 170 countries in which they operate. So, yeah, this is a\nmassive action which the U.S. can unilaterally do on its own,\neven if others are not happy with it.\nSenator Tester. OK. So the trade war that is currently\ngoing on with China, is this helping them achieve their 2025\ngoals?\nMr. Kennedy. Well, no, the trade war is an annoyance\nbecause what they prefer is to go back to business as usual so\nthat they can continue to invest and follow the business model\nthat I described at the beginning and that they are so familiar\nwith.\nThe trade war is not stopping them. They have got plenty of\nmoney, and they have not been fully disengaged from the global\neconomy, and certainly globalization is central to their\nsuccess. They cannot do this all by themselves, even though\nsome Chinese think they could. But, you know, unless we are\nlooking to fully disengage and try to entirely isolate the\nChinese, they are going to keep moving in the direction that\nthey want to go until they feel----\nSenator Tester. But the truth is without our allies being a\npart of the sanctions that are put onto the trade war, we\ncannot achieve isolation of China alone.\nMr. Kennedy. No, we cannot.\nSenator Tester. OK. Our stepping back and getting out of\nthe TPP, is that helping them achieve their 2025?\nMr. Kennedy. I recognize that there are some elements of\nTPP which people find objectionable, and TPP is not an ideal\nagreement, but it would have been helpful to have tried to put\nsome measures of constraints on some of Chinese industrial\npolicy and gain multilateral collaboration in keeping the\nChinese out of TPP until they made those reforms. Of course,\nthe Chinese often do not live up to their agreement, and so\nthey could have gamed that system, too. But TPP would have been\nhelpful in combination with the other types of defensive\nmeasures that we are using as well.\nSenator Tester. OK. So not being in it was a net negative\nas far as our abilities, OK.\nMr. Wolf. I agree.\nSenator Tester. You guys talked about China's ability to\nenforce controls of fentanyl, implement their own rules if they\nhad the proper incentives. Tell me what those proper incentives\nare.\nMr. Nephew. Well, Senator, I would start off with the fact\nthat, you know, there is a general incentive to not have this\nbe a bilateral issue between the United States and China, at\nleast insofar as the Chinese have demonstrated throughout the\ntrade war that they wanted to try and deconflict this issue.\nNow, that could be because they are trying to buy good will\nfrom the United States, or it could be, you know,\nindependently. But I think this also then speaks to the need\npotentially for sanctions, because sanctions can also provide\nthe disincentive to continue with allowing their companies to\ndo behavior that we find objectionable, and that could be\nhelpful in this regard.\nSenator Tester. OK. I think I understood what you said, and\nI have got to shut up because I am past time, but I am more\nlooking for what we need to do to give them the incentives to\nenforce their rules.\nMr. Nephew. Well, Senator, I would say one of the\nincentives that we can give them is the need to avoid U.S.\nsanctions penalties.\nSenator Tester. I got it.\nMr. Nephew. Right? So that is definitely one----\nSenator Tester. But, once again, don't those sanctions have\nto happen--I mean, in the instance I took up before, you said,\nright, it can be done unilaterally. But most of the time, don't\nthose sanctions have to come with our allies' help?\nMr. Nephew. Yes, Senator. As a general point, multilateral\nsanctions will always be more effective than unilateral ones.\nSenator Tester. Thank you. Thank you all very, very much. I\nappreciate it.\nChairman Crapo. Senator Cotton.\nSenator Cotton. Thank you, gentlemen, for joining us for\nthis hearing on the 30th anniversary of the massacre at\nTiananmen Square by the Chinese Communist Party.\nI would like to speak first about Huawei, a simple question\nto get answers from all three of you, starting with Mr. Wolf.\nWho owns Huawei?\nMr. Wolf. It is complex, but obviously it is closely\naffiliated with the Chinese Government. But I do not know the\nexact legal answer, but I agree with the premise of your\nquestion.\nSenator Cotton. Mr. Kennedy.\nMr. Kennedy. Officially, on paper, all of their employees\nown the company. But that has been shown to be quite suspect,\nand so actually it is not clear. Also, since they are not\npublicly listed, there is very little required transparency to\ngive you an answer to that question.\nSenator Cotton. Mr. Nephew.\nMr. Nephew. Senator, I do not have any more independent\ninformation than these two.\nSenator Cotton. So the leadership of Huawei along with\nChinese Communist Party officials often talk about Huawei being\nemployee-owned. It sounds like you would dispute the claim that\nit is employee-owned as opposed to have perhaps at most some\nkind of employee incentive profit-sharing plan. Mr. Wolf, you\nnodded your head in a way that does not reflect in the record.\nMr. Wolf. No, I agree with the basis of what you are\nasking. That is all I was nodding my head for.\nSenator Cotton. Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Nephew, anything to add?\nMr. Kennedy. I would just say its ownership is ambiguous\nfor sure.\nSenator Cotton. So the holding company of Huawei is 1\npercent owned by its founder, 99 percent owned by a mysterious\ntrade union committee. Mr. Kennedy, I see you nodding your\nhead. Do you know anything about this trade union committee?\nMr. Kennedy. Well, all Chinese companies are supposed to\nhave unions that are associated with the All-China Federation\nof Trade Unions, which are not really bottom-up unions that\nrepresent their members. They represent the Chinese State.\nSenator Cotton. So is it fair then to say that the Chinese\nCommunist Party, if it does not own Huawei according to Western\nlegal standards, at least controls at a fundamental level the\ndecisions of that company?\nMr. Wolf. Or could give it instructions to do something in\nthe interest of the Chinese Government at some point, yes.\nMr. Kennedy. I would just say I have followed Huawei and\ninteracted with it for a couple decades, and my sense is that\nat the operational daily level, they walk, talk, and look like\na company that makes their own strategic decisions. But given\nthe industry that they are in and how strategically important\nit is, I would expect a great deal of behind-the-scenes\ninteraction with every side of the Chinese State--central and\nlocal.\nSenator Cotton. Mr. Nephew, anything to add?\nMr. Nephew. No, Senator.\nSenator Cotton. I think, Mr. Wolf, it was you in the answer\nwho mentioned stock listings. I would like to--oh, I am sorry.\nMr. Kennedy mentioned stock listings. I would like to turn to\nstock listings here in the United States. There are several\nhundred Chinese firms currently trading on the New York Stock\nExchange, the Nasdaq, and other exchanges, yet they are largely\nimmune from oversight, for instance, from the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board and other common practices in our\nmarket-based economy. Should Chinese firms be allowed to trade\non our stock exchanges given that they are largely immune from\nthe kind of Western scrutiny and auditing that American and\nother Western companies face?\nMr. Kennedy. I think ideally I would have required them--\nwhen we started giving listings, I would have required--would\nhave preferred that to be a precondition that they were exposed\nto that. But now that you have several hundred, I do not know\nif it makes sense to just automatically de-list them all until\nChina complies, or if you should have the SEC or others\ninvestigate these companies one by one to see if there is some\nplace that they are not in compliance and have action taken\nthat way, or by their shareholders.\nSenator Cotton. Mr. Wolf, Mr. Nephew, anything to add on\nthat question?\n[Witnesses shaking heads.]\nSenator Cotton. Why was it decided to allow opaque Chinese\ncompanies to be publicly listed on our stock exchanges?\nMr. Kennedy. My sense is that when this decision was done\nin the late 1990s, there was an effort to get more companies\nlisted on American stock markets and help investors, and there\nwas the expectation that these were--that these looked like\nprivate companies, and that the transparency of listing would\nprovide outsiders a chance to monitor the companies in a way\nthat they could have confidence that even had they come from\nChina, you could still learn a lot more about them than if they\nwere not listed.\nSenator Cotton. Like so many wishes about China's economy\nand Government from the late 1990s, it turned out not to be\ntrue. Thank you, gentlemen.\nChairman Crapo. Senator Warner.\nSenator Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI want to pick up where Senator Cotton left off, and let me\npreface it by saying I think China is a great Nation,\nextraordinary Nation, extraordinary history, extraordinary\npower, going to be a great power going forward. But I dealing\nwith concur with Senator Cotton in his comment that the vast\nmajority of Chinese companies are in a sense fronts for the\nCommunist Party. And my concern with Huawei and ZTE is not only\nthe direct concerns around Huawei and ZTE but around the notion\nthat what China is attempting to do is to set the standards in\n5G. In a certain way, this should be a wake-up call not just\nfor the United States but for the West, writ large, because I\nwould argue across the board post-Sputnik, most technology and,\nmore importantly, the standards around the technology, whether\nit is the Internet, telecom, space, social media, have\ngenerally been defined by the United States, and the rest of\nthe world has followed that, and while we have not always\ngotten it right, I think there has been a general agreement\nthat directionally we have headed appropriately.\nI fear that that leadership is fading away, the fact that\nwe have not stepped up and set any guard rules around social\nmedia and defaulted that to the Europeans or California or\nothers I think will have long-term ramifications. I think in\nthe case of 5G the Administration was very late to recognizing\nthis more macro threat.\nI guess, Mr. Kennedy, I would slightly disagree with you. I\nthink because, as we were trying to make the case to countries\naround the world of the security--inherent security concerns\nwith Huawei equipment that in a distributed 5G network you\ncannot stop a company from sending upgrades on a regular basis,\nand those upgrades are where the potential vulnerabilities will\nfall--it is not that there is a back door right now--and,\nconsequently, that the Administration had to take a fairly\ndraconian action in terms of putting Huawei on an entity list\nto send the message to the world that we were serious about\nthis issue, candidly as well to say to some of our own rural\ntelcos and satellite providers they have got to rethink. But I\nwould like you to drill down a little bit because one of the\nthings--and Senator Crapo and I have met with folks in the\nsemiconductor industry, that entity designation being so\nbroadly based really was a fairly blunt instrument and could, I\nthink as Senator Crapo pointed out, have a negative impact on\none of our strongest American domestic industry, the\nsemiconductor industry.\nSo how would you rethink that entity designation? There is\nin my mind a great deal of difference about buying equipment\nfrom an enterprise like Huawei versus the ability for us to\nsell chips into a Chinese market that is still 35, 40 percent\nof the overall world. Do any of you have any comments on how\nyou might refine that entity designation with certain\nexemptions that might again keep the market down? And I would\nalso argue that what is ironic--let me as a quick aside--I do\nnot want to use up my whole time with my question, but a quick\naside, though, is that many of the countries a la Korea and\nothers who have been anxious for us to make that designation\nand to sound the alarm on 5G and Huawei, it would be ironic if\nin sounding that alarm we created a circumstance where actually\nKorean chip manufacturers benefited while the American chip\nmanufacturers lost out.\nSo how would you go about refining that entity designation?\nMr. Wolf. The answer is in your question: carve out that\nwhich we care about, aggressively enforce it, enforce the\nrules, and that which is less sensitive or benign or\ncommercial, that allows the U.S. to maintain dominance in this\narea to on a very tailored, controlled, monitored basis, allow\nthat to go forward in order to prevent the very foreign\ndominance that you were just describing.\nSo I would just take your question and work it back to you\nas the answer. I agree with it completely.\nSenator Warner. Mr. Kennedy.\nMr. Kennedy. I guess I would put more emphasis on the\nExecutive order that the Administration issued banning purchase\nof Huawei equipment into the United States. It is probably\nbeing the best step toward protecting ourselves and then having\nallies follow along so that the Western world just simply does\nnot introduce that equipment, if it is 5G, if it presents the\ndanger that you said, and I would be extremely tailored and\nnarrow on the entities list, leaving out, you know, chips and\nthings that go into cell phones and things that are on the very\nedges of networks, which do not present that type of security\nconcern.\nSenator Warner. Mr. Nephew, do you have anything to add?\nMr. Nephew. No, Senator.\nSenator Warner. But you would, Mr. Kennedy, just use more\nthe EO rather than the entity list--although I would argue that\nthe entity list carries a greater weight. But I would love to\nhave additional follow-up and refinement from both of you\nbecause this is an issue that we are continuing to make the\ncase to American industry about some of the challenges of doing\nbusiness with China right now.\nMr. Kennedy. Yes.\nSenator Warner. And I did not get to my question about\nventure capital investment from Chinese firms into American\nventure capital firms, which prevents a whole other set of\nissues. But we need to do it with some level of refinement.\nMr. Wolf. Sure. One last--I was the father of the ZTE\nentity list action and how that was handled and would love to\ncontinue the discussion, both in specific and in abstract,\nhow----\nSenator Warner. My fear would be that the White House, in\nan effort to try to make a deal with China, may tradeoff--for X\nbillion dollars of agricultural sales, may tradeoff this\nnational security issue around intellectual property theft and\ntechnology standards, which is a much, much bigger deal, I\nwould argue.\nMr. Wolf. I agree.\nSenator Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Crapo. Thank you.\nSenator Tillis.\nSenator Tillis. Thank you all for being here. I was just\ndown in a Judiciary Committee hearing where we were talking\nabout fentanyl and China's role in poisoning and killing some\n38,000 people in the United States. They are one of the major\nsuppliers, and they are sending it either directly by mail or\nthrough precursors and through drugs that are ultimately being\nmanufactured in Mexico.\nOver the course of the past couple of months, I have met\nwith a number of people in my travels across the State and the\nNation, and I had a very interesting meeting about 2 months\nago. This group, this business, which actually manufactures\nfreight rail cars here in the United States, talked about a\nvery successful 10-year investment of the Chinese in one of\ntheir State-owned enterprises for convincing Australia that\nthey should ``manufacture''--I will put that in quotes--their\ncommuter rail cars because they could do it for a lower price\npoint, they would maintain manufacturing in Australia, and they\nwould have a reliable product.\nThe Australians bought that, and over the course of a few\nyears, it was very clear that all they were doing was\nassembling in Australia for a brief period of time, and now\nthey basically send shrink-wrapped commuter rail cars directly\nfrom China to Australia.\nSo when they diminished that portion of the industrial\nbase, they did the same thing for freight rail cars, and now in\nAustralia they have no indigenous industrial base for something\nthat I would consider on the rail side a very important\nstrategic asset.\nNow if you go to Boston and you go to Chicago and you go to\nL.A., guess who is offering a lot of their commuter rail cars?\nChina, starting with the promise of indigenous manufacturing,\nbut basically trying to play out the same thing since they have\nproven it in what we could consider a pilot project in\nAustralia, now they are trying to play out the same thing here.\nIn fact, they also tried to make an investment in freight rail\ncapability that was actually in my State that, for a variety of\nreasons, did not go through. I think they are doing something\nsimilar down in Miami.\nWhat I see China doing is arising as a military threat\nclearly and an economic threat, and it is one of the reasons\nwhy I tend to support the President going after all facets of\nthe relationship with China right now. I do believe the\ndesignation of Huawei was appropriate not only because of the\nthreat in the 5G space, but because of their repeated theft of\nintellectual property, not really innovating, reverse\nengineering and creating competitive products for companies,\nmany of them based in the United States just months after a new\nproduct is introduced.\nSo if you look at just the broader, the bigger picture, is\nthere any Nation out there that we should be more worried about\neconomically and technologically than China?\nMr. Kennedy. Yeah, I guess my answer would be no, that\nChina's size, scale, its focus on these industries, the very\nfrosty strategic relationship which we have with them which\ncould get much worse means that China should be front and\ncenter, and that means that other challenges that we have that\nare problematic but do not rise to the same scale, we should\ndifferentiate, and there are others that we can collaborate\nwith in addressing that challenge, which is, as you said,\nnumber one.\nSenator Tillis. What about the future--you know, China has\ngot a lot of smart people, a lot of them good people. It is the\nleadership that I have a concern with, and I think there are\nmalign objectives. But what about the future in the financial\nspace? Could we see ourselves at some point in the near- to\nlong-term future that we have pension systems and a number of\npeople in the United States invested in a way that future\neconomic actions that may diminish Chinese economic growth and\nprosperity is becoming a political issue because taking those\nactions could ultimately have people rise up and say, ``You are\nhurting my pension plan''?\nMr. Kennedy. Well, certainly we already have a whole\nvariety of economic contact with China. Financially, there is\nsome--you know, through the stock markets and securities\nmarkets. What we do not have now is a lot of American money,\nassets in the Chinese financial system, and they have opened it\nup, and I would say we ought to be very hesitant about----\nSenator Tillis. What about future Chinese assets invested\nand a part of broader investment portfolios? So I am talking\nabout the reverse.\nMr. Kennedy. Yes, so Chinese investing here as well. Right\nnow we do not have--those restrictions are really from the\nChinese side limiting the----\nSenator Tillis. No, I am talking about like maybe a\ndiversified international portfolio that has a significant\namount of dependence on economic performance in Chinese\nmarkets, reaching a point where now all of a sudden--I served\nin the State House before I came up here. When you start\nmessing with policies that could affect pension plan\nperformance, then you get American people worried about their\npocketbooks. I am worried about that end game at some point. I\ndo not think we are there yet, but, I mean, what kind of\ncontrols do we have in place to prevent that sort of an end\ngame?\nMr. Kennedy. We have zero controls on that. But I would\nalso be worried that if we have so much money dependent on\nChina, that the stability--that our investors would think the\nstability of the Communist Party is as important as the Chinese\nthink it is, and we want to avoid that.\nSenator Tillis. That is my concern. It is not something\nthat we have talked about a lot, but the Chinese are playing\nthe long game, and I have no doubt in my mind at some point\nthey would like to see punitive actions taken toward China\nrepresenting an existential military or other threat, suddenly\nit becomes a political issue because it could harm the\npocketbooks of pensioners.\nMr. Nephew, I will let you finish your thought.\nMr. Nephew. Senator, if I could just say one thing, I very\nmuch share your concerns, and I would just note that there are\nsome Chinese scholars who are already starting to think about\nways in which they can weaponize U.S. access to the Chinese\neconomy, frankly, playing back to us some of the sanctions\ntools that we have used in the past, and I think this is part\nof the reason why we ought to be very careful about how we\napproach all of those tools.\nSenator Tillis. Thank you.\nChairman Crapo. Senator Van Hollen.\nSenator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank all of\nyou for your testimony today, and I just want to say at the\noutset I support the legislation, the Fentanyl Sanctions Act,\nand that is a crisis everywhere in the country, including in\nMaryland.\nI also want to follow up on some of the questions Senator\nCotton had with respect to Huawei. My sense is that it is the\nconsensus of the U.S. intelligence community that if Huawei\nwere to come to dominate the 5G network globally, that would\npose a national security risk to the United States, an\nunacceptable one. Do you all agree with that conclusion?\nMr. Kennedy. Well, I have never worked in the U.S.\nGovernment, so I do not have the security clearance to be able\nto give you the kind of answer which you have gotten from\nothers with much more information than me.\nSenator Van Hollen. Does anyone dispute that conclusion?\n[Witnesses shaking heads.]\nSenator Van Hollen. So then the question is: Where we do we\ngo from here, right? And, obviously, this Administration has\nbeen trying to work with our European partners and others to\npersuade them that it is a mistake to go down the Huawei road,\nand they had mixed success with that. A lot of our European\nallies are, I think, thinking of going a different way. And\nthen the Administration obviously put Huawei on the entities\nlist, which was a tough move but I think in my view sent an\nimportant signal.\nBut my question is: If the preferred strategy is to work\nwith others around the world in terms of preventing others from\nbecoming reliant on Huawei as the 5G network, how do we do it?\nYou have an Administration that has been essentially\nthreatening sanctions against all of our allies with clubs. I\nmean, we threatened Canada. Now we have threatened Mexico. You\nknow, now Australia was under consideration. How do you go\nabout getting our partners on board with respect to the\nstrategic threat posed by Huawei at the same time we are\nclubbing our partners with tariffs? How would you suggest we\nproceed if you all agree or do not dispute the conclusion that\nHuawei dominance of a 5G network would be a threat?\nMr. Kennedy. I guess I would just say, you know, when the\nU.S. was preparing to invade Iraq in 2003, Secretary of State\nPowell went to the U.N. and gave a speech and outlined the\nrisks regarding weapons of mass destruction. Now, it ended up\nnot being the best information, but I think the U.S. owes it to\nthe American people and others to talk more publicly about what\nthe risks are. You are not going to build a political consensus\nwithin the U.S. or with your allies without greater sharing of\ninformation. So I would suggest even though there are risks to\nsharing some of that information, I think it would be valuable\nto building the argument.\nAnd then, second, you are going to need to work with Nokia,\nEricsson, other suppliers in telecom in 5G so that you have\nenough capacity so that you can build that equipment and then\nyou can provide the services on top of it. So I think it is\ngoing to be collaborative between Governments and across\nindustry--to get this to be successful.\nMr. Wolf. What he said.\nMr. Nephew. Senator, if I can, I would just add an\nadditional point, too, which is prioritization, and I think you\nare speaking to this when you bring up all the various\ndifferent sanctions that we are threatening on our partners and\nso forth. If we believe that this is a very serious and\nsubstantial threat to U.S. national security, then we ought to\nbe elevating that above other threats and other interests. And\nI think the fact that we are at this point not prioritizing\namongst our various interests is problematic. It makes it hard\nto dissect what we care about the most, and it certainly makes\nit more difficult when you go in with 15 different things you\nare trying to get out of a country as opposed to four or five.\nIn the Iran sanctions experience which I have done a lot of\nwork in, we went into most of our international meetings with\nthat as our number one, two, and three international agenda\nitems, and people understood where that sat in our\nprioritization. I think we need a similar, more strategic view.\nSenator Van Hollen. I share your view. I mean, I do believe\nthis is a strategic issue for the United States, and I think we\ndo need to prioritize it. And I think when we are fighting with\nall our allies on other trade issues, it undermines that\nconcerted effort. Would you all agree with that?\n[Witnesses nodding heads.]\nSenator Van Hollen. Very quickly, Senator Kennedy and I\nhave introduced legislation dealing with the problem where you\nhave some Chinese-owned companies trying to enter the United\nStates market without complying with the oversight requirements\nof the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which all\nother countries have to comply with. Would you agree that we\nshould hold China to the same standards and rules that\neverybody else has to comply with?\nMr. Kennedy. Yes. I think that would be the ideal goal. The\nquestion is: What do you do with the existing firms? And do you\ngrandfather them in? Do you create some type of process to\nallow them to come into compliance? So I think the goal is\nworthy. The question is do you have to create a transition\nprocess to make it effective and do not harm those who came in\nunder different rules, have complied with those different\nrules, and could, if given the opportunity, comply with the new\nrules.\nSenator Van Hollen. Good. I appreciate that, and I think we\nwill reach out to you to work on that. Thank you.\nChairman Crapo. Senator Cortez Masto.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you.\nMr. Kennedy, back to fentanyl, I do not think any\ncommunity, whether it is opioid abuse or now fentanyl, is free\nfrom seeing it in, unfortunately, the overdose and the number\nof deaths and the impact on families. That is true in Nevada.\nI was encouraged to see that on May 1st the Chinese\nGovernment implemented a ban on all fentanyl-related substances\nby adding them to a controlled substance list. Now, though, the\nban has to be enforced.\nSo here is my--I am curious. Based on your work with the\nChinese Government, do you believe that the Chinese Communist\nParty has the will to implement the fentanyl ban both at the\nnational and the provincial levels?\nMr. Kennedy. I think Mr. Nephew is probably more of an\nexpert in this area than me, but in looking at the Chinese\nbehavior in the past and with regard to this, I think it\ndepends on where the overall relationship with the U.S. goes.\nIf they see that we could stabilize the relationship and that\nwe want to peacefully coexist, they will generate the political\nwill. But if not, this will be a lower priority, and this will\ncontinue to be a problem.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you. And, Mr. Nephew, I am\ngoing to ask you to answer that, but also this, because I\nnoticed in October 2018 in Foreign Affairs you wrote about the\nimportance of multilateral coordination to ensure the U.S.\nGovernment does not overuse the power of sanctions. So can you\ntouch on both of those questions?\nMr. Nephew. Absolutely, Senator. So on the first, I would\ntend to agree that there is a relationship element to how\nChinese enforcement goes, but I think there are two other\nelements that are important, too.\nThere is a capacity issue, especially when we are dealing\nwith materials that are relatively low signature, and I can\ngive as a comparison some dual-use export controlled goods that\neven if I think the Chinese Government wanted to enforce some\nrules on them, they had difficulty given the number of\nworkshops and so forth that exist in China. That does not mean\nthey could not do better, and I think that was always our\ndemand, especially when we presented them with intelligence\nabout problems. But I think that is a crucial component of\nmaking this work.\nSecond is I think the Chinese do care about international\nreputation. It has been very important to them in other export\ncontrol kinds of contexts, in other concerns about problems\nemanating from China. So I think to the extent--and this goes\nto your second point--that we are multilateralizing the\nconversation with the Chinese, that will be very effective\nbecause then they will sense there is a multilateral risk if\nthey do not take appropriate action.\nI think one of the problems we have at present--and there\nare others more expert in fentanyl than I am certainly--\nfentanyl remains a very U.S. problem at this point, and to the\nextent that it has yet to spread to a number of other\ncountries, that makes multilateralizing it more problematic.\nBut I do not think that does not mean it cannot be part of the\nconversation, especially, unfortunately, as we do see it spread\nas a problem in other countries and jurisdictions.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you. I appreciate that.\nListen, I spent 8 years as Attorney General and addressing\njust in general illicit drugs coming into the country. The U.S.\nconsumes, I know, 80 percent of the drugs that just come in\nfrom Mexico. You are right. It is a supply and demand issue.\nBut at the same time, other than just the enforcement piece of\nit, we need other tools and mechanism procedures to really\nforce some of these countries to work with us. And so I\nappreciate the comments here today.\nLet me, Mr. Wolf, talk on another subject. A few weeks ago\nthe New York Times reported that as many as 18 countries are\nusing Chinese-made surveillance systems. In some cases, these\nsystems allow Governments to monitor the citizens' faces and\nhunt down dissidents. What, in your terms--and you talked a\nlittle bit about it earlier, but what are the national security\nimplications for the United States if we do not respond to\nChina's expanding exports of this type of technology?\nMr. Wolf. Well, in addition to national security, the\nexport control rules allow for foreign policy objectives to be\nachieved through regulating particular items, types of\nequipment, or particular end uses or end users that are\nengaging in acts contrary to our interests. So the export rules\nwould allow , for example, designations of entities or items\nand, better yet, if we work with our regime allies in concerted\naction to address the threat you are dealing with. And all that\nauthority exists in the new law that was implemented or,\nrather, passed last August. So the authority exists to address\nthe concern that you are describing, and it is a function of\nthe Administration coming together to identify the\ntechnologies' end uses and end users to be able to work with\nthe issue and to get our allies to cooperate.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you. I appreciate that. I know\nmy time is up. I will submit the rest of my questions for the\nrecord.\nMr. Wolf. I will be happy to help.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you.\nSenator Brown [presiding]. Senator Smith.\nSenator Smith. Thank you, Ranking Member Brown, and thank\nyou to all of you for being here and testifying today. It is\nvery interesting.\nI would like to return to an area of questioning that\nSenator Brown touched on and also Senator Tillis. We know that\nChinese-funded State-backed enterprises are aiming to become a\ndominant global manufacturer in new energy vehicles like buses.\nMinnesota is home to two New Flyer manufacturing plants in St.\nCloud and Crookston that make these kinds of buses. And several\nyears ago, a Chinese-funded bus manufacturer set up shop in the\nUnited States, and they are unfairly competing with buses that\nare being made in my State, Minnesota, thanks to Chinese\nsubsidies. So this is the underpinning for the bill that\nSenator Brown and Senator Crapo and others of us have\nintroduced that would prevent Federal transit dollars from\nbeing used to procure passenger rail cars and transit buses\nfrom Chinese State-owned or subsidized enterprises, and this\nmakes just eminent sense to me.\nSo I would like to ask you, what should we be doing about\nthese Chinese-funded companies that are operating in the United\nStates that are undermining these longstanding market-driven\nU.S. companies? Mr. Wolf. Mr. Kennedy.\nMr. Wolf. Well, sure. The legislation you described I agree\nwith. When other areas such as CFIUS or export controls do not\naddress the problem you have described, then you need new\nlegislation, and the legislation that was described earlier\ntoday is, I think, right on. So beyond your bill, I do not have\nan answer.\nSenator Smith. Thank you.\nMr. Kennedy.\nMr. Kennedy. If the fact pattern is as you describe and\nthey are receiving subsidies or other types of support that are\nnot permitted by the WTO, then it seems to me that is ripe for\na countervailing duty case that the Commerce Department would\nbring, which would then put massive tariffs on their products.\nAnd then perhaps the bill, the legislation, would be another\nalternative approach to hold them to account in case that type\nof case would not work.\nBut I also think that we need to also look at multilateral\nrules related to how State-owned enterprises operate. So it is\nnot just us. It is others. Because these companies are selling\ntheir vehicles all over Europe and everywhere else.\nSenator Smith. Right.\nMr. Kennedy. And so we have to look at this as a global\nproblem, not just an American problem.\nSenator Smith. Could you explain to me how a countervailing\nduties case would work when these are U.S.-manufactured\nproducts?\nMr. Kennedy. So if you could not apply it because they are\ndomiciled here and registered here, then you could use\nantitrust legislation and you could basically have the Federal\nTrade Commission or others bring a case against them for abuse\nof that dominant position that allows them to sell at such\nattractive prices that others cannot compete. So there are\npotentially other existing rules that we might be able to use,\nbut, again, if they would not work, then your solution might be\nthe best way to go.\nSenator Smith. I appreciate that. You know, what I am\nconcerned about with relying on antitrust is that we end up\nhaving to be able to demonstrate significant market--you know,\nsignificant damage to companies, including potentially being\ncompletely forced out of the market in order to kind of win an\nantitrust case. And so I would just suggest that that is why\nthere is a good reason to try to be more proactive about this\nrather than just waiting for the damage to be done and then\ntrying to mop up the mess.\nAny other comments on this?\n[No response.]\nSenator Smith. I just have a minute left. I want to just\ntouch on something, Mr. Kennedy. I was really struck in your\ntestimony about the point that you make about the importance of\nmaintaining U.S. economic competitiveness. This has been\nsomething that I have been so concerned about as I think about\nhow the United States needs to be leading the charge and not\nfollowing the charge when it comes to a clean energy future.\nAnd in your testimony, you talk specifically about DOE funding\nfor breakthrough battery technologies and how important this is\nfor us to be able to be leaders and not followers in this area.\nI completely agree with you on this and have been working with\nboth Democrats and Republicans, especially on the battery\nstorage area, with bills that would fuel that kind of research\nand development at DOE.\nBut just in the few seconds I have left, could you\nelaborate any more on other ideas that you have for what the\nUnited States should be doing to stay economically competitive\nin this clean energy sector?\nMr. Kennedy. Well, part of it is Federal Government funding\nfor research that is tied to not just discovery but also to\nmanufacturing in the United States, because the technologies\nare not just about making sure it works in the lab, but also\nscaling up and creating additional incentives for the products\nto be scaled up and used in the United States. So that is on\nthe producer side. But you are also going to need to have\npolicies that affect demand, that promote these technologies to\nbe used and commercialized in a way that is profitable for\nindustry and addresses those same type of concerns with regard\nto the climate and pollution. So I think you are going to--\nsupply and demand.\nSenator Smith. I agree with that. Thank you. I am out of\ntime, but I appreciate that, and I think especially in this\nsector, in the clean energy sector, China is eating our lunch,\nand we are going to be in a subservient position on this if we\ndo not get on the ball.\nThank you.\nSenator Brown. Senator Jones.\nSenator Jones. Thank you, Ranking Member Brown, and thanks\nto the Chairman and you for having this really important\nhearing.\nI want to go back and focus on fentanyl because it is such\nan important issue for my State in particular. You know, I\nstarted my career, after working here in the Senate, as an\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and that was in the days when cocaine\nwas just really beginning to hit. And we have seen waves and\nchallenges with cocaine, with crack cocaine, with\nmethamphetamines, and now the CDC says we are in kind of the\nthird wave of the prescription opioid crisis with wave number\none being heroin, wave number two is synthetic opioids, and now\nwe are in fentanyl. And we have seen in Alabama double-digit\nincreases in opioid overdose deaths, and that starts with\nfentanyl.\nTo show you just to demonstrate what I am talking about\nhere, two milligrams is essentially a lethal dose. This little\nwhite speck next to this penny represents a lethal dose of\nfentanyl. Recently, we had in Limestone County, Alabama, some\n2.2 grams that were seized, 100 times this amount, and but it\nis still a very small amount. I mean, we are still talking 100\ntimes will still fit on a penny. And the challenges for local\nlaw enforcement, that is the biggest concern I have, because it\nis an incredible--our U.S. Attorney in the Northern District of\nAlabama where I served during the Clinton administration, Jay\nTown, made the comment that there is not a one-off solution.\nThere is not one area of law. Getting more drug dealers off the\nstreet is not going to impact it. We have to go to China. We\nhave to use the State Department resources, Treasury Department\nresources, the full weight of the White House, and anything\nthat the Justice Department can do. Clearly, this is a\ntransnational crisis, and I hope you can address this, and\nmaybe you do not have the experiences, but the unique\nchallenges facing local law enforcement with such a deadly\ndrug.\nCan each of you, just for the record, briefly address what\nyou believe to be the unique challenges that our local--you\nknow, the cop on the street faces with this kind of challenge\nwith fentanyl?\nMr. Nephew. Well, Senator, I would say my experience has\nbeen in the Federal Government level, so I do not have\nexperience at a local law enforcement level. But what I will\nsay is I do think that this is part of the reason why there\nneeds to be a whole-of-Government approach to address this\nproblem, why you do need to be able to identify illicit\ntraffickers abroad, why you then need to link that intelligence\nto an active diplomatic campaign, with the threat of sanctions\npotentially there as well, to give penalties and a disincentive\nto continue with this trafficking, because as you noted, the\nsize differential and the value of what they are able to\ntransfer versus the costs and profit margins are substantial,\nand that is a major challenge when it comes to interfering with\nand denying access to the United States of these goods.\nSo to me, you absolutely have to deal with source issues.\nYou have to deal with the diplomatic strategy, and you have to\ngive some disincentives for China to look the other way with\nrespect to this.\nBut, also, you need to be forward-looking because China is\nour problem today. There may one day be other suppliers, and\nsome scholars on this have pointed to India, Nigeria, South\nAfrica. So this is part of the reason why you need a very agile\nand adaptive strategy that is looking at all the various\ndifferent threat factors.\nSenator Jones. All right. And have you seen the bill that\nSenator Toomey and I have that puts fentanyl on the same par\nwith cocaine and methamphetamine to try to stop this problem?\nMr. Nephew. Yes, Senator. Senator Toomey mentioned it\nearlier, and I think that makes a lot of sense.\nSenator Jones. Great. One of the issues that we are also\nseeing now with this is the use of the post office. Again, you\nknow, history tends to repeat itself. You track shipments, you\ndo these things, but this is another one. You know, now we are\nseeing purchases off the Dark Web. In Madison County, Alabama,\n40 grams in a shipment. Forty grams of fentanyl was seized from\none guy. What can we do to help the post office? What can we\nbetter do to try to stop the use of our United States postal\nsystem for this deadly problem?\nMr. Nephew. Yes, Senator, in researching for this\ntestimony, I understand that there has already been legislation\npassed that would give additional resources to the Postal\nService. I think at this point we need to see the regulations\nand the implementation of that to see how effective it will be.\nBut, again, this is part of the reason why you have to address\nthe supply concerns as well because there is always going to be\na problem of how large the body of shipments are and how much\nthe inspector is able to actually go through with it. You need\nto try and address the supply issues as well so you can head it\noff before it comes here.\nSenator Jones. Great. Well, thank you all. Thank you for\nyour testimony. I may have some additional questions for the\nrecord.\nThank you.\nSenator Brown. Senator Sinema.\nSenator Sinema. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank\nyou to our witnesses for being here today.\nToo often Americans grapple with addiction in silence. In\n2017, according to the Kaiser Foundation, 267 Arizonans died\nfrom overdosing on synthetic opiates like fentanyl. That is\nmore than double the number of overdoses that were reported in\nArizona in 2016, and it is nearly four times that which was\nreported in 2015. So it should not surprise us that fentanyl is\nnow the leading cause of overdose deaths in the United States.\nBut the Americans who grapple with addiction are our\nbrothers and sisters, and many of them also struggle with\nmental health issues. Others sought relief from chronic pain\nthat sometimes accompanied a lifetime of hard and honest work,\nand many of these individuals wore the uniform and defended our\nfreedom with dignity and honor. But when they returned home,\nthe challenges of acclimating to civilian life and the wounds\nof war can open the door to self-medication and addiction.\nSo ending the epidemic requires more than just stopping\nillicit fentanyl. This crisis shows that the addiction is\nbigger than any one drug, and I want to ensure that all\nArizonans have quality, affordable health care so they are\nequipped to fight addiction in all its forms.\nMr. Chairman, the health care system in Arizona known as\nAHCCCS is our State's Medicaid program, and it plays a pivotal\nrole in ensuring that Arizonans get the treatment and support\nthey need to overcome addiction. That is why when some proposed\ncutting Medicaid, our AHCCCS, and jeopardizing the drug\naddiction treatment it provides to thousands of Arizonans, I\nfought hard and voted no against that because Arizonans should\nnot be forced to fight this battle alone. So we also have to\ncombat drug trafficking and particularly the trafficking of\nfentanyl.\nAt our Committee's last hearing, I spoke about our southern\nborder crisis and the millions of dollars of methamphetamine\nand fentanyl that have poured over the border from Mexico into\nArizona, almost all through our ports of entry. But Arizonans\nare seeing this, that just 2 weeks ago Border Patrol agents in\nNogales and in Tucson seized 143 pounds of meth and 220 grams\nof fentanyl worth half a million dollars. So we need\ncomprehensive solutions to the border crisis and to our\nNation's opiate epidemic, which includes finding new ways to\nimprove our sanction regimes and export control policies.\nSo, Mr. Nephew, my first question for you is this: In\nApril, China announced it would ban all variants of fentanyl,\nbut it is my understanding that China's ban does not include\nall the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl and its\nanalogs. So China still has the ability to send these raw\nchemicals to Mexico and elsewhere for production, and they can\nship them into the U.S. So your testimony emphasized the\nimportance of ensuring any new sanctions are considered in the\ncontext of our current sanctions regime and are targeted in\nscope and purpose.\nAs we consider additional sanctions in this space, what\nadvice would you offer to Congress to ensure sanctions remain\nflexible enough to capture these precursor chemicals used to\nmake fentanyl but targeted enough to accomplish what we are\naiming to do?\nMr. Nephew. Thank you, Senator. I would say two things.\nI think, first, this to me speaks to why just having the\nKingpin Act and the sanctions that come along with it is not\nsufficient. We need to have more sanctions tools, and I think\nthe FSA gives us a much more flexible sanctions approach that\nwould allow us to target a broader range of companies and\nentities that are potentially involved in the trafficking of\nthese goods, and especially to create disincentives for them to\ncontinue doing so if they have other legitimate business that\npotentially is at risk. And this to me speaks to the issue of\nprecursors in particular. If they have got other chemical\nbusiness interests, then to my mind putting those at risk as a\nresult of U.S. sanctions threats potentially could be very\neffective way of addressing this.\nBut related to this, you need to also keep the Kingpin Act\nin place to deal with countries--or, rather, entities in\ncountries that refuse to cooperate or entities that are fully\ncommitted to engaging in this because they are just illicit\ntraffickers. That is their only business model, if you will.\nAnd so I think having a variety of tools that are all\nembedded in a diplomatic approach that is comprehensive and\nwhole of Government, to me that is the way in which you can\naddress all the various different components.\nSenator Sinema. Thank you.\nMr. Kennedy, we have heard concerns that China's regulatory\nagencies may not have the capacity to enforce the new fentanyl\nban, so what is your assessment of the Chinese Government's\ncapacity to effectively enforce the ban? And what steps can\nCongress take to ensure that China keeps its promise?\nMr. Kennedy. They may not have the capacity now, but if\nthey decided it was a high priority, they could mobilize the\ncapacity. They have done that on so many different issues when\nit has been shown to be in their self-interest or their\ndiplomatic interest that they have moved the needle on things.\nSo I think if this is a very high priority for the United\nStates and our relationship with China, we ought to explain\nwhat it is and how we can help them build capacity, but also\ngive them foreign policy incentives to do so. They certainly\ncould address it if they want to.\nI would engage with Chinese authorities, public health\nfigures in China, to increase communication. Right now the\ncommunication between the U.S. Executive branch and China is\nnot smooth whatsoever because of the growing tensions in the\nrelationship. But it may be that this Committee or Congress\ncould be more of an honest broker than they--you know, usually\nit is the executive that has done that, but maybe the Senate\ncould provide that kind of help.\nSenator Sinema. Thank you.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nSenator Brown. Thank you.\nI appreciate Senator Sinema's comments about Medicaid. This\nhearing has been about law enforcement--I mean, not so much law\nenforcement, but about exports from China and Mexico,\nespecially China, and we have all talked about law enforcement\nand the important role of law enforcement. But her comments\nabout Medicaid--I was in a treatment center in Cincinnati\nseveral months ago at a place called ``Talbot House'', and a\ngentleman, a middle-aged man, put his hand on his daughter's\narm, and he said, ``Without Medicaid, my daughter would be\ndead,'' and how important it is that as we do these issues and\nas we help law enforcement and partner with law enforcement,\nthat we scale up treatment programs, and there is probably not\na community in America that has had the funds and the resources\nto do that. So thank you, Senator Sinema, for bringing that up.\nThat concludes our questioning. For any Senators wishing to\nsubmit questions for the record, those questions are due 1 week\nfrom today, June 11th. As for the witnesses, we ask, if there\nare submitted questions, that you please respond as promptly as\nyou can to those questions.\nThank you for being here today. The hearing is adjourned.\n[Whereupon, at 11:47 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]\n[Prepared statements, responses to written questions, and\nadditional material supplied for the record follow:]\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN MIKE CRAPO\nToday, June 4, marks the 30th anniversary of China's brutal\nCommunist Government crackdown on unarmed, civilian protestors, in\nTiananmen Square, dashing a pro-democracy movement's highest hope for\nreforms.\nThat image of a young man standing in front of a row of rolling\ntanks is an indelible reminder of the true character and intentions of\na Government in China that today is pursuing Made in China 2025, the\nmost ambitious, unorthodox industrial policy program in the history of\nthe world.\nThe Made in 2025 program aims to shift China's economy into higher\nvalue sectors such as those associated with robotics, aerospace, and\nartificial intelligence, more generally.\nIn a very short span, Beijing has managed to transform itself from\nthe perennial hope of being a cooperative trade partner to an all-out\nstrategic competitor, in part, to confront China's industrial policy\nprogram, which, among other things, includes subsidies for its domestic\ncompanies developing advanced semiconductors, the bedrock of all\nthings, today.\nWorse still, China is one of the United States' largest trading\npartners and it is in part pursuing that policy through a concept known\nas ``civil-military fusion,'' which is intended to provide the missing\nlink between China's technological and military rise.\nWhile the United States pursued policies aimed to integrate China\ninto the global economic order, China persisted in predatory practices\nat home: to force American companies to disgorge their technologies; to\nsubsidize its own firms domestically and their trade around the world;\nand otherwise throw various roadblocks in front of foreign firms.\nToday's escalating trade and technology tensions can be seen as\nconsequences of a Government that not only brutally rejected its own\npeople's hopes for reform 30 years ago, but has since exploited the\nopenness of a global economy, and embarked on its own brand of economic\nnationalism and technological supremacy.\nThis path, if unchecked, advantages not only Chinese firms, but can\nboost Chinese military strength at the same time.\nMore and more, U.S. national security grounds are called upon to\nconfront threats to America's dominance in high technology\nmanufacturing and other threats from China.\nThe work of the Banking Committee with its jurisdiction over banks,\nmarkets, export promotion, export controls, and reviews of foreign\ndirect investment security and economic sanctions, sits at the\nintersection of U.S. national security, U.S. economic prosperity and\nthe global economy.\nToday, the Committee will focus on three threats from China.\nThe first two threats arise from emerging national security issues\nassociated with foreign investment in the United States and the export\nof critical technologies, particularly in the semiconductor industry,\nwhich is a primary target for illicit acquisition.\nLast year, the Committee successfully negotiated and the President\nsigned into law The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act\n(FIRRMA) and the Export Control Reform Act (ECRA). Together, this\nbipartisan, bicameral legislation works to enhance the Federal\nGovernment's authorities to protect America against illicit foreign\ninvestments in, acquisitions of, and transfers of America's most\nsensitive technologies.\nToday, the Committee will hear from a variety of perspectives on\nwhether these new laws are sufficient to counter China's threats, or if\nother measures must be considered.\nOf particular interest is the question of how we separate and\nprotect U.S. cutting edge technology from the non-national security\nrelated trade that finances America's greatest innovative achievements.\nThe third threat we will focus on involves the supply of fentanyl\nto the United States, which is causing close to 38,000 American deaths\na year, now.\nThe question is if a set of sanctions tools can be effectively\nleveraged to restrict the supply of illicit fentanyl into the United\nStates.\n______\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR SHERROD BROWN\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, for calling this important hearing to\nassess key questions before the Committee about our changing\nrelationship with China, on this 30th anniversary of Tiananmen Square,\nas we remember those who fought for democracy and human rights as part\nof that movement.\nToday we will focus on whether to provide the Administration with\nnew sanctions tools to complement existing Foreign Narcotics Kingpin\nsanctions, targeting traffickers in China, Mexico, and elsewhere who\nare contributing to the rising tide of illicit opioids coming into the\nU.S., including powerful new forms of fentanyl.\nLast month, China took the long overdue step of controlling the\nfull range of fentanyl analogues. This should mean that all forms of\nsynthetic drugs which look and act like fentanyl will be subject to\nChina's drug control laws. I'm glad China's Government took that step.\nNow we have to make sure they implement and enforce it. As Ohio's steel\nindustry knows, without strict enforcement, promises from China don't\nmean very much.\nBut we can't wait to see whether China enforces its laws. Fentanyl\nhas become the leading cause of overdose deaths. On average, 14 Ohioans\ndie every day due to an opioid overdose, and those Ohio families can't\nafford to wait and see whether China will enforce its rules this time.\nA recent Washington Post study found that the Ohio Valley is\nsuffering the most from the surge in overdose deaths due to synthetic\nopioids. I ask consent to include the Post article, entitled ``Fighting\nFentanyl'', into today's record.\nWe can bolster Chinese efforts by taking steps of our own to target\ntraffickers. Our bipartisan Fentanyl Sanctions Act led by Senator\nSchumer would give the Administration new sanctions tools to help stem\nthe tide. And it would help provide intelligence and funding to keep\nthese dangerous drugs out of Ohio communities.\nWe will also address today the range of challenges posed by China\nin export control, intellectual property theft, technology transfer,\nand certain foreign investments--including through China's massive Belt\nand Road Initiative, its Made in China 2025 initiative, and targeted\ncollaborative investments in U.S. firms with critical technologies that\nChina seeks to acquire.\nWe must respond forcefully when China's ambitious and sometimes\nillegal acquisition strategies are deployed against U.S. firms, raising\ncritical national security or economic security questions here at home.\nThis is what we did last year when we passed the Foreign Investment\nRisk Review Modernization Act--updating and expanding both the\nCommittee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and export\ncontrol laws.\nAlmost a year after enactment of these reforms, we'll hear\ntestimony that some foreign investors continue trying to capture the\nintellectual property of leading edge U.S. technology companies for\ntheir home country's military uses, or worse, to disrupt U.S. supply\nchains.\nOur current control systems attempt to prevent this type of\ntechnology transfer through multilateral and unilateral export\ncontrols. This system identifies dual-use products, technology, and\nsoftware that may not be exported, or is strictly limited. Is this\napproach still sufficient, when coupled with new constraints on\nemerging and foundational technologies and other reforms contained in\nexport control reforms enacted last year? Is the law being implemented\nas written?\nChina continues to use nontariff barriers to block foreign\nproducers from entering its market. And Chinese State-owned\nenterprises, such as those in steel and other sectors, receive\nextensive subsidies that allow them to compete with no consideration of\nmarket forces. That makes it harder for U.S. companies and workers to\ncompete--again, as our Ohio steel industry knows all too well.\nI don't think CFIUS and its investment review process can or should\nbear the burden of trying to bring about a fair trading relationship\nwith China. It has its hands full trying to police the national\nsecurity threats we face\nBut as we know, much foreign investment in the U.S. falls outside\nof the scope of CFIUS, and we don't have a good way to review it to\nmake sure it's in our economic interests. And it's not always easy to\nmake the distinction between national security and economic security.\nI have introduced legislation with Senator Grassley--the Foreign\nInvestment Review Act--that would require the Secretary of Commerce to\nreview certain foreign investments, particularly those made by State-\nowned-enterprises, to make sure they are in the long-term, strategic\ninterests of American workers and American businesses.\nOther issues in our Committee's jurisdiction also need attention.\nChairman Crapo and I have joined with Senators Cornyn, Baldwin, and 40\nother cosponsors on a bill to prohibit Federal funds from being used by\ntransit agencies to purchase rail cars and buses manufactured by\nChinese State-subsidized companies. Federal dollars should not support\nanticompetitive, heavily subsidized Chinese products that undermine\nAmerican workers and threaten the future of U.S. automotive and rail\nmanufacturing. The bill also addresses cybersecurity risks facing our\nNation's transit systems.\nFinally, our Committee must move quickly to provide a long-term\nreauthorization to the Export-Import Bank. Each year, China's export\ncredit agencies provide more medium- and long-term investment support\nthan the rest of the world's export credit agencies combined. American\nmanufacturers need a reliable Export-Import Bank that is authorized for\nthe long term to stay competitive as they pursue business abroad.\nIt is clear that on China there is still much work to do.\nThank you to our witnesses here today. I look forward to hearing\nyour views.\n______\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF KEVIN WOLF\nFormer Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration,\nBureau of Industry and Security, Department of Commerce\nJune 4, 2019\nChairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and other Members of the\nCommittee. Thank you for asking me to testify about and otherwise\ndescribe U.S. export controls pertaining to China. Although I am now a\npartner in the international trade group at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and\nFeld LLP, the views I express today are my own. I am not advocating for\nor against any potential changes to legislation or regulations on\nbehalf of another. Rather, as requested, I am providing you with my\nthoughts on and understanding of such issues regarding the applicable\nexisting regulations and statutes. My views are influenced by my more\nthan 25 years of work in the area, which includes my service as the\nAssistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration during the\nObama administration.\nThe topic is a serious one. The United States never wants to be in\na fair fight with an adversary. The appropriate, aggressively enforced,\nclearly written, and well-funded export and related controls are a\ncritical part of maintaining that advantage. They are also a useful\ntool in helping to achieve U.S. foreign policy, which include human\nrights, objectives. I have never subscribed to the view that export\ncontrols should ``balance'' national security or foreign policy\nconcerns with economic or trade concerns. National security and foreign\npolicy concerns exist in their own right and are not to be traded off\nfor something else in a particular transaction. The controls should,\nhowever, be tailored to specific, identifiable national security\nthreats or foreign policy objectives to avoid collateral economic\ncosts, unnecessary regulatory burdens, and misallocation of Federal\nresources. For the U.S. to be a global leader, our companies need to be\nsuccessful in the global marketplace. Thus, excessive and over-broad\ncontrols--as a matter of law or perception--harm the U.S. industrial\nand technology base, which results in harm to our national security.\nLax, out of date, or poorly enforced controls have the same effect.\nThus, as a practitioner and a former policymaker in this area, I am\npleased that you are holding this hearing and otherwise raising the\npriority of this complex topic.\nWith respect to China, the issues pertaining to what the dual-use\nexport control rules and policies should be are the most complex and\nsignificant of all export control issues. This has been the case for\ndecades. It is one of our largest trading partners while at the same\ntime being a long-standing country of concern with respect to internal\ndiversion of dual-use items for use in modernizing its military. On the\nother hand, as I recently described to the U.S.-China Economic Security\nReview Commission, decisions involving military items and commercial\nspace-related items destined to China are relatively easy to analyze\nbecause of the strict statutory and regulatory embargoes pertaining to\nsuch exports and the clear, widely accepted national security and\nforeign policy reasons for them.\nDeciding what the right national security controls should be over\ncommercial items that are not specific to military applications with\nrespect to China (or any other country) ultimately boils down to how\none defines ``national security.'' The traditional definition begins\nwith national security experts regularly identifying the commodities,\nsoftware, and technologies that could give an adversary a military or\nintelligence advantage or cause us to lose ours. The process also\nincludes identifying the commercial items that are required for the\ndevelopment, production, or use of weapons of mass destruction,\nparticularly missiles, chemical/biological weapons, and nuclear\nexplosive devices. Then, experts in each technology area work backwards\nfrom the identified threat to describe the technical characteristics of\ncommercial items necessary for the development, production, or use of\nsuch items. Regulators, in a well-established interagency process, then\nwork to add the items to the regulatory control lists of the United\nStates and its multilateral regime allies. This work is done in\ncoordination with industry--through both advisory committees and notice\nand comment processes--to avoid unintended impacts and to ensure\nclarity. Affected entities in the U.S. and abroad (because U.S.\ncontrols are extraterritorial) then adjust their internal compliance\nprograms so that they know when authorization is needed to export such\nitems. When a company wants to ship a listed item (or release a\ncontrolled technology to a foreign person), then regulators review its\nrequest to do so in the form of a license application. The regulators,\nas part of a well-tested interagency process, determine whether the\nexport or release would be consistent with our national security and\nforeign policy objectives. That is, they assess, with the use of\nintelligence community resources as necessary, whether the item is\ndestined for an acceptable end use or end user, or whether there is a\nrisk that it would be diverted to an unacceptable end use, end user, or\ndestination. They respond accordingly in the form of a license, a\ndenial, or a license with conditions. Enforcement officials investigate\nand punish violations of the rules and to ensure or motivate\ncompliance. The process must constantly evolve because technologies and\nthreats are constantly evolving.\nAnother definition of ``national security'' includes trade policy\nconsiderations and sees China's economic ambitions in a wide variety of\neconomic sectors, particularly those described in its Made in China\n2025 plan, as a per se and long-term threat to the economic health of\nthe United States. Technologies that would support the development of\nsuch efforts should therefore be controlled, even if they cannot be\ntied to a specific military or intelligence application. Export\ncontrols should be used to have an impact on the economic viability of\nforeign companies that compete with U.S. companies. Demand in China for\nthe technologies grows more quickly than regulations and multilateral\ncontrols can be updated, meaning that unilateral controls should be\nused more often. These views, combined with the general and State-\nsupported effort within China to find military applications for dual-\nuse technologies, warrant broader than the traditional considerations\nover the types of items that should be controlled for export to China\nand what the licensing policies should be.\nI am not here today to challenge or pick a fight over anyone's\nparticular world view or perspective on how global economics work.\nOthers are much more qualified than me to explain the benefits and\ncosts of industrial policy, comparative advantage, and barriers to\ntrade. I am not denying the extremely serious issues pertaining to\nChinese State-supported economic espionage, intellectual property\ntheft, diversion of civil items for military applications, and forced\ntechnology transfer. I am also not denying that China's civil-military\nfusion policies, among other things, make many end-use commitments\nquestionable and force more aggressive review of applications to export\ncontrolled items to China. I agree that it is massively hard for\nregulations to keep pace with the evolution of technology and to get\nconsensus with our allies with respect to matters involving China. What\nI can do, however, is to describe what, based on decades of experience,\nexport controls can and cannot accomplish regardless of one's world\nview on these issues or other China-specific concerns. In sum, my main\ngeneral point today is that the application of export controls in ways\nthat are unclear, unpredictable, or unilateral generally ends up\nharming the very interests they were designed to protect.\nI believe that a mature and sophisticated understanding of what\nexport controls can and should accomplish is codified in the recently\npassed Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (ECRA), which I will also\ndescribe. It is an excellent piece of bipartisan legislation that\nprobably can be the authority to address just about any problem that\nexport controls can address, including those involving China. It is a\nmodern, coherent, and permanent authorization for not only list-based\ncontrols (i.e., over the export of identified items), but also end-\nuser-based, and end-use-based controls as part of a three-legged stool\napproach to achieving national security and foreign policy objectives.\nCongratulations to this Committee, its staff, its House counterparts,\nand the Administration in getting it through along with related\nimprovements to the laws governing foreign direct investment.\nECRA is, however, quite new. Indeed, the regulators have not even\nfinished the process for drafting implementing regulations, such as\nthose with respect to possible new controls on exports to China\n(section 4818) or on emerging and foundational technologies that are\nnot now controlled but should be given China-related concerns (section\n4817). Thus, although it is not my job to tell members of Congress how\nto do theirs, my suggestion and request for the greater good would be\nfor Congress to provide substantially more financial and other support\nfor and oversight of the agency responsible for shepherding all this\nactivity, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security\n(BIS). It is a terrific little agency with great people that punches\nway above its weight. Never before though have the issues over which it\nis responsible been more complex, fast-moving, and consequential--\nparticularly with respect to issues involving China. It, thus, needs\nsignificantly more resources than it has now to do properly all the\njobs given to it by ECRA, other laws, new Executive Orders, and the\nAdministration. Also, BIS has not been for decades subject to as many\nstatutory standards for what it should and should not do with respect\nto export controls as is now the case with ECRA. Thus, a vital\nrequirement for successful export control policy is for this Committee\nand the House Foreign Affairs Committee to regularly ensure that ECRA\nis being faithfully implemented.\nExport Controls and the Primary Agencies That Administer Them\nBefore I dive into China-specific issues, it is important to level\nset for everyone that export controls are the rules that govern\n1.  the export, reexport, and (in-country) transfer\n2.  by U.S. and foreign persons\n3.  of commodities, technology, software, and, in some cases,\nservices\n4.  to destinations, end users, and end uses\n5.  to accomplish various national security and foreign policy\nobjectives, including human rights objectives.\nThis one sentence summary is deceptively simple. As much as this\nand previous Administrations try to make the rules easy to understand\nand apply, they are inherently complex from an industry perspective.\nFrom the policymakers' perspective, each export control decision\nrequire multivariate policy and legal analyses involving statutes,\nregulations, international commitments, intelligence and law\nenforcement equities, intelligence community threat assessments,\nindustrial base implications, license administration, budgets,\navailable technical expertise, corporate compliance program\nconsiderations, foreign availability, interagency dynamics, how global\nproduction and supply chains work, congressional concerns, multilateral\nand bilateral foreign policy issues, and, in the end, largely\nsubjective assessments of what constitutes a national security or a\nforeign policy concern with imperfect information that can be addressed\nthrough regulating the movement of commodities, technology, software,\nand some types of activities.\nThe technologies are often evolving and wide ranging, including\neverything from information about bird flu to machine tools to items\nthat are being invented today that most do not understand. Specific\ncommodities, such as certain types of microwave monolithic integrated\ncircuits, that are critical to advanced military radar are equally\ncritical to modern telecommunications applications. Technologies that\nwere once sensitive become ubiquitous, such as the GPS technology in\nour cell phones. Generally nonsensitive commercial technologies can,\nhowever, be applied to new uses or by end users of concern in ways that\nare harmful to our interests. Most extraordinarily advanced\ntechnologies, however, represent no threat whatsoever. Many simple, old\ntechnologies, such as those unique to standard military equipment,\nwarrant controls for most of the world. Concerns about destinations,\nend users, and end uses vary widely and change constantly. The mere\nexistence of a control, and the internal obligations that go with it,\ncan sometimes do more harm than good even if the regulators would\ngenerally approve transactions under its authority.\nThe Export Control Reform Act of 2018\nI described the U.S. export control system in more detail to the\nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee during its consideration of what\neventually became ECRA. I incorporate those comments by reference. ECRA\nis the new authority for the Export Administration Regulations (EAR),\nwhich BIS administers. Although BIS leads the dual-use export control\nsystem, ECRA, Executive Orders, and regulations require significant\ninteragency cooperation on licensing policies and decisions, primarily\nwith the Defense Department on national security issues and the State\nDepartment on foreign policy issues.\nUntil ECRA, the statutory authority for the EAR--the Export\nAdministration Act of 1979--had lapsed decades ago. The EAR were kept\nin effect through a series of Executive Orders and emergency\ndeclarations issued under the authority of the International Emergency\nEconomic Powers Act. Thus, for decades, Congress had not expressed a\ncoherent vision for what export controls should be designed to\naccomplish. Although there were certainly basic good Government reasons\nmotivating ECRA's introduction and passage, we basically have\nbipartisan concerns regarding Chinese investment strategies and efforts\nto acquire dual-use technologies for use in modernizing its military to\nthank for bringing Congress together on this issue.\nAs you know, in late 2017 and the first half of 2018, there was a\nnonpartisan effort to reform and expand the jurisdictional authority of\nthe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS),\nlargely in response to national security concerns pertaining to\ninvestments in the United States from China. One of provisions in the\nForeign Investment Risk Review and Modernization Act (FIRRMA) as\nintroduced would have given CFIUS jurisdiction over some types of\noutbound investments by U.S. critical technology companies in foreign\ncountries in order to regulate the transfer of currently uncontrolled\nemerging and foundational technologies that, with more analysis,\nwarranted controls. I and many others, including many on this\nCommittee, said that such concerns were warranted, but that addressing\nthem through CFIUS both under-controlled and over-controlled. It under-\ncontrolled because the Government's review would only be triggered with\na covered transaction. If the U.S. Government should regulate the\ntransfer to China or elsewhere a newly identified sensitive technology\nfor national security reasons then it should regulate the transfer of\nsuch technology regardless of the nature of the underlying investment.\nI and many others pointed out that the U.S. Government already had a\nregulatory system and an interagency process in place to identify and\ncontrol technologies of concern--the dual-use export control system BIS\nadministers.\nThat policy debate is what led to ECRA's being the legislative\nvehicle for addressing the identification and control over transfers to\ncountries of concern such as China of emerging and foundational\ntechnologies. This then led to an opportunity for Congress to finally\nimplement permanent statutory authority for the EAR, to articulate a\nmodern vision for export controls, enhance export control enforcement\nauthorities, and to codify in law decades of BIS practice, policies,\nand regulatory reforms--including the Obama administration's Export\nControl Reform accomplishments. The rules regarding foreign investment\nin the United States and export controls are now connected and\noverlapping to address, among other things, policy concerns over the\nrelease to foreign persons in the U.S. and abroad of the technologies\nto be identified. In sum, CFIUS uses its authority over inbound\ninvestment to address concerns, inter alia, regarding transfers of\npotentially sensitive uncontrolled technologies to foreign persons. The\nEAR focus on outbound activities (and releases to foreign persons in\nthe United States of controlled technology) to address technology\ntransfer concerns regarding identified technologies. Emerging and\nfoundational technologies added to the EAR's list of controlled items--\nthe Commerce Control List (CCL)--will simultaneously expand CFIUS's\njurisdiction over foreign investments in the U.S. involving such\ntechnologies.\nAs I and many others could describe separately, the Treasury\nDepartment is leading the effort to draft the regulations to implement\nFIRRMA, i.e., the new rules expanding CFIUS's authority to regulate\nforeign investment in the United States that might create unresolved\nnational security issues. From conferences, I understand Treasury plans\nto publish proposed rules later this year. Because Commerce has not yet\npublished proposed rules implementing ECRA provisions (such as those\npertaining to controls over emerging or foundational technologies) and\nTreasury has not published new rules implementing FIRRMA provisions\n(such as those pertaining to noncontrolling investments in critical\ninfrastructure), I cannot comment on them. With respect to ECRA, I can,\nhowever, provide the context for the issues to help you and others\nevaluate the proposed rules once they are published.\nEmerging and Foundational Technologies--Identification and Control\nEfforts Motivated Largely by Concerns Pertaining to China\nUnderstanding that the bar for the imposition of unilateral\ncontrols should be high, Congress set out in ECRA clear statutory\nstandards governing the effort to identify and control emerging and\nfoundational technologies--again, largely in response to concerns\nraised by efforts by Chinese companies to acquire such technologies and\nuse them in ways contrary to U.S. national security interests.\nSpecifically, ECRA section 4817(a) requires the Administration to\nconduct an interagency effort that reaches out to all available sources\nof information--including academia, industry, and the intelligence\ncommunity--to identify emerging and foundational technologies that\n``are essential to the national security of the United States'' and\nthat are not now subject to a multilateral control in the EAR's CCL or\ndescribed on one of the other lists of technologies the U.S. controls\nfor export. \\1\\ Once such technologies are identified, ECRA requires\nBIS to get industry input on the controls in response to a proposed\nrule. Such comments must then be considered, consistent with the\nstandards in ECRA, before BIS imposes any final controls on the newly\nidentified technologies.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Even before ECRA, BIS had the authority to impose unilateral\ncontrols over technologies that warranted control. We created a process\nfor doing so in 2012--the ``0y521'' process. ECRA's emerging and\nfoundational technology provisions are largely based on this process.\nThe difference, of course, is that ECRA section 4817 expresses the will\nof Congress and made the effort mandatory as opposed to discretionary.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlthough ECRA does not define ``national security,'' a request for\ncomment BIS published in November 2018 described the national security\nconcerns to be addressed by the effort, i.e., to identify now\nuncontrolled items that ``have potential conventional weapons,\nintelligence collection, weapons of mass destruction, or terrorist\napplications, or [that] could provide the United States with a\nqualitative military or intelligence advantage.'' \\2\\ These examples\ntrack ECRA's definition of a ``dual-use'' item, which is an item that\nhas ``civilian applications and military, terrorism, weapons of mass\ndestruction, or law-enforcement-related applications.'' Given the broad\ncontrols that already exist in the EAR over items specially designed\nfor military applications that are not controlled by the International\nTraffic in Arms Regulations, and all technology at any stage required\nfor their development or production, I am not certain what now-\nuncontrolled items meet this definition. That is, however, what the\nECRA section 4817 process is designed to discover in a regular-order,\ntransparent fashion.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\2\\ BIS stated in its notice that it is not attempting to ``expand\njurisdiction over technologies that are not subject to the EAR.'' EAR\nsection 734.3(b)(3) states that the following types of information are\nnot ``subject to the EAR,'' regardless of their content: (i)\n``published'' information; (ii) information that arises during, or\nresults from, ``fundamental research;'' (iii) information released by\ninstruction in academic institutions; (iv) information in patents and\npublished patent applications; (v) information that is a nonproprietary\nsystem description; and (vi) certain types of telemetry. Each of these\nelements of the regulatory exclusion is further defined in this and\nrelated EAR provisions. BIS presumably made this point to allay\nconcerns by some, particularly in the academic and research\ncommunities, that BIS's effort to identify and control emerging and\nfoundational technologies might somehow affect the long-standing\nuncontrolled status of published information and fundamental research.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn deciding whether to identify such a technology as ``emerging''\nor ``foundational'' and impose unilateral controls on its export,\nreexport, and in-country transfer, ECRA section 4817(a)(2)(B) requires\nthe Administration to take into account the:\n1.  development of the technologies in foreign countries;\n2.  effect export controls imposed pursuant to this section may have\non the development of such technologies in the United States;\nand\n3.  effectiveness of export controls imposed pursuant to this section\non limiting the proliferation of emerging or foundational\ntechnologies to foreign countries.\nBIS has recently implemented multilateral controls on emerging\ntechnologies that are essential the national security of the United\nStates. (The new controls pertain to discrete microwave transistors,\nsoftware operations, post-quantum cryptography, underwater transducers,\nand air-launch platforms.) Licenses are required to export such items\nto China and most other countries. BIS officials have said publicly\nthat it and its export control agency colleagues continue work on\nidentifying additional such technologies for consideration as either\nunilateral or multilateral controls. This makes sense because ECRA\nrequires the effort to be an ``on-going'' one. That is, contrary to\nmany comments I have heard, ECRA does not contemplate a one-time\npublication of new unilateral controls on emerging and foundational\ntechnologies.\nThe technology areas BIS announced that it is studying dovetail\nwith those China announced in its Made in China 2025 plan as those of\nstrategic significance for the country. According to BIS, they include:\n``Biotechnology''\n``Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning\ntechnology''\n``Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) technology''\n``Microprocessor technology''\n``Advanced computing technology''\n``Data analytics technology''\n``Quantum information and sensing technology''\n``Logistics technology''\n``Additive manufacturing (e.g., 3D printing)''\n``Robotics''\n``Brain-computer interfaces''\n``Hypersonics''\n``Advanced Materials''\n``Advanced surveillance technologies''\nFor each technology identified in a proposed rule to be controlled\nas ``emerging'' or ``foundational,'' ECRA essentially imposes on BIS a\nburden of justifying why the proposed control meets several statutory\nstandards. Thus, for example, ECRA essentially requires BIS to\ndemonstrate:\n1.  Why the technology proposed to be controlled is ``essential'' to\nU.S. national security;\n2.  What the specific weapons-, military-, or intelligence-related\napplication the control is designed to address that is not now\nbeing addressed by a control;\n3.  Why the unilateral control would not harm domestic research in\nthe technology;\n4.  Why the rule would be effective at stemming the proliferation of\nthe identified technology to countries of concern such as China\n(taking into account any foreign availability of the same\ntechnology); and\n5.  The results of BIS's full consideration of the impact on the U.S.\neconomy that would result from the unilateral control.\nWithout such information, industry and this Committee would not be\nable to provide useful comments or oversight consistent with the\nstandards and goals of ECRA.\nIf BIS imposes controls on such technologies, or subsets thereof,\nECRA requires the Administration to work to get a multilateral regime\nto agree to the same control so that the United States is not alone in\nthe control. This effectively means that any proposed control should be\nof a type that is consistent with, and would likely be accepted by, the\nrelevant multilateral regime. Proposing a control over an item\ninconsistent with what a regime would accept would defeat the point of\nthis ECRA provision and the high bar ECRA places on the use of\nunilateral controls for emerging or foundational technologies. In any\nevent, as evidenced by industry comments, such multilateral efforts are\nvital to ensuring that the controls are effective and that U.S.\ncompanies are not put at an unfair competitive disadvantage relative to\nits competitors in allied countries.\nIndustry comments on the process were due on January 10, 2019. They\nseem to be largely concerned that unilateral controls on commercial\ntechnology available outside the United States would harm U.S.\nindustry. That is, such controls would merely drive demand for such\ncommercial technologies to non-U.S. countries. This would harm the\nability for companies in the United States to invest in the R&D\nnecessary to advance such technologies while enhancing the ability of\ncompanies outside the United States to do so. Another concern was that\nunilateral controls over such technologies would be ineffective\nbecause, given the international development of the broad categories of\ntechnologies identified, they would not deprive China of the ability to\ndevelop or acquire the same capability from elsewhere. Many commenters,\ntherefore, asked BIS not to adopt any new controls on such technologies\nuntil and unless they were agreed to by one of the relevant\nmultilateral regimes.\nIndustry also largely did not know how to respond to BIS's requests\nfor comments regarding what industry thought were now uncontrolled\ntechnologies essential the national security of the United States.\nIndustry essentially offered information on foreign availability, asked\nBIS to abide by the ECRA standards, and asked to be included in the\ndrafting efforts to ensure clarity and precision. Many comments,\nhowever, said that it was the Government's job to identify the national\nsecurity threats that were not now being addressed but should be, not\nindustry's. BIS has not responded to the comments, probably because it\nis still working through the issues with its interagency colleagues. It\nalso has not yet issued a notice asking for similar industry comments\non which ``foundational'' technologies should and should not be\ncontrolled.\nGoing back to my polite request for more resources for BIS, this\neffort is vastly more difficult and resource-intensive than anything we\ndid during the Export Control Reform effort. It was relatively easy to\ncomprehend technology to develop a military aircraft's landing gear\n(and hundreds of thousands of other similar components), for example,\nand change its jurisdictional status to enhance military\ninteroperability with our NATO-plus allies. It is radically harder to\ncomprehend technology related to quantum computing, for example--and\neven harder to sort out the subsets thereof essential to U.S. national\nsecurity that are even capable of being controlled given its cross-\nborder development. It was also much easier for us to assess the\neconomic impacts of changing the jurisdictional status of less\nsensitive military items than it will be for BIS to gather the ECRA-\nrequired information from industry to assess the economic impact of a\nunilateral control, even a short-term unilateral control that might\nlater be submitted to a multilateral regime. Such assessments must take\ninto account not only the loss of actual sales but also the long-term\nimpact on foreign customers and whether they will consider U.S.\ncompanies to be unreliable suppliers and thus move their business to\nnon-U.S. manufacturers.\nIf the Trump and subsequent Administrations strictly follow the\nECRA standards, then any new controls will only be over a small list of\nnonmature specific technologies that are essentially unique to the\nUnited States, not currently export-controlled, and truly essential to\nthe national security (and thus should have been controlled under any\nAdministration even without the section 4817 effort). I do not know\nwhat will happen with respect the first group of proposed new controls\nunder ECRA, but I do know that industry in potentially affected\nindustries is extremely interested in whether their commercial\ntechnologies will become subject to unilateral controls or a tool of\ntrade policy. Companies are or will be making decisions on whether to\ninvest or not invest in the United States based upon a belief or fear,\nrational or otherwise, that technologies in various commercial sectors\nwill or will not be able to be shared, jointly developed, and sold.\nECRA States That Export Controls Exist To Accomplish National Security\nand Foreign Policy Objectives\nIndustry's concern, at least in my experience, that export controls\nnot become a tool of trade policy is echoed by ECRA's statement of\npolicy for why U.S. export controls exist. Specifically, section\n4811(1) states that the United States should ``use export controls only\nafter full consideration of the impact on the economy of the United\nStates and only to the extent necessary--(A) to restrict the export of\nitems which would make a significant contribution to the military\npotential of any other country or combination of countries which would\nprove detrimental to the national security of the United States; and\n(B) to restrict the export of items if necessary to further\nsignificantly the foreign policy of the United States or to fulfill its\ndeclared international obligations.''\nECRA's second statement of policy for why U.S. export controls\nexist is additionally limited in scope to addressing specific,\ntailored, identifiable national security and foreign policy objectives\nthat do not include trade policy concerns.\nThe national security and foreign policy of the United States\nrequire that the export, reexport, and in-country transfer of\nitems, and specific activities of United States persons,\nwherever located, be controlled for the following purposes:\nA.  To control the release of items for use in--\n1.  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or of\nconventional weapons;\n2.  The acquisition of destabilizing numbers or types of\nconventional weapons;\n3.  Acts of terrorism;\n4.  Military programs that could pose a threat to the security of\nthe United States or its allies; or\n5.  Activities undertaken specifically to cause significant\ninterference with or disruption of critical infrastructure.\nB.  To preserve the qualitative military superiority of the United\nStates.\nC.  To strengthen the United States defense industrial base.\nD.  To carry out the foreign policy of the United States, including\nthe protection of human rights and the promotion of democracy.\nE.  To carry out obligations and commitments under international\nagreements and arrangements, including multilateral export\ncontrol regimes.\nF.  To facilitate military interoperability between the United States\nand its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other\nclose allies.\nG.  To ensure national security controls are tailored to focus on\nthose core technologies and other items that are capable of\nbeing used to pose a serious national security threat to the\nUnited States.''\nThus, with respect to any new proposed control, ECRA effectively\nrequires BIS to assess and identify to this Committee and the public\nwhat the impact on U.S. industry would be as a result of a new control;\nhow it furthers one of the listed objectives; and how it is\n``tailored'' to ``focus'' on ``core'' technologies that pose a specific\nand ``serious'' national security threat. Nothing about these standards\nchanges because the destination of an item would be China or another\ncountry.\nAlthough ECRA does not require specific national security concerns\nto be compromised to achieve economic objectives, it does state in\nparagraph 3 of its policy statement that the ``national security of the\nUnited States requires that the United States maintain its leadership\nin the science, technology, engineering, and manufacturing sectors,\nincluding foundational technology that is essential to innovation. Such\nleadership requires that United States persons are competitive in\nglobal markets. The impact of the implementation of [ECRA] on such\nleadership and competitiveness must be evaluated on an ongoing basis\nand applied in imposing controls under [ECRA] to avoid negatively\naffecting such leadership.'' Of course, Government is the one\nresponsible for making national security determinations, but industry\nis generally in a better position to assess how or whether a specific\nexport control would negatively affect its global leadership in an\narea. Thus, their views in response to this statutory requirement of an\nongoing evaluation of the impact of export controls should be solicited\nand given great weight--again, understanding that the Government must\nmake the final call on what is in the national security or foreign\npolicy interests of the United States.\nThis is one area where issues involving China-specific export\ncontrols become massively complex and sometimes counterintuitive. For\nmany U.S. industries, China is one of the largest customers. The\ncompanies use the income from such sales to benign end uses and end\nusers to fund their R&D efforts in the United States to advance the\nnext generation of their products. This allows them to remain\neconomically competitive internationally, which thus enhances the U.S.\nindustrial base. Without such sales, the income will go to their\ncompetitors outside the United States, which results in companies in\nthe United States becoming less economically competitive relative to\nforeign competitors and indigenous development in China. This is why I\nam a firm believer in ECRA's requirement that controls be tailored to\nspecific, identifiable national security threats so that a loss of\ntrade in less sensitive items where risk of diversion is low does not\nend up harming the U.S. industrial base, which thus harms our national\nsecurity in more fundamental ways.\nECRA Strongly Favors Multilateral Controls Over Unilateral Controls\nAs discussed earlier, a major concern of industry in response to\nBIS's request for information about emerging technologies is that BIS\nwould impose unilateral controls--i.e., those that only the United\nStates imposes. Congress had the same general concern when it wrote in\nsection 4811(5) that ``[e]xport controls should be coordinated with the\nmultilateral export control regimes. Export controls that are\nmultilateral are most effective, and should be tailored to focus on\nthose core technologies and other items that are capable of being used\nto pose a serious national security threat to the United States and its\nallies.'' ECRA subsection (6) goes on to state that ``[e]xport controls\napplied unilaterally to items widely available from foreign sources\ngenerally are less effective in preventing end-users from acquiring\nthose items. Application of unilateral export controls should be\nlimited for purposes of protecting specific United States national\nsecurity and foreign policy interests.'' Thus, I am not saying that\nECRA prohibits unilateral controls, only that they should be rare and\nnarrowly tailored to address specific national security or foreign\npolicy issues, and imposed consistent with the ECRA standards described\nearlier.\nI realize that one of the motives for the outbound investment\nprovision of FIRRMA as introduced was that the multilateral control\nprocess is slow. It requires consensus among between 30 and 40 or so\nregime partners with many different types of industries and local\nconcerns. Most of the allies do not have the same concerns with respect\nto China that the United States does. There are language barriers and\nother agendas that get in the way. Other countries' enforcement systems\nfor violations are not as robust as ours. I get that. I dealt with it\nregularly. Process is hard. Short-cut alternatives of easy feel-good\nunilateral controls, except in extraordinarily narrow and specific\ncircumstances, however, will always end up doing more harm than good\nfor the very industry or technology the control is designed to protect.\nThat is the lesson learned from decades of export control efforts and\nis true regardless of one's view of global economics or definition of\nnational security. The work and the investments (and thus U.S. jobs)\nwill simply be driven off-shore to allied countries without such\ncontrols. Foreign buyers will design-out U.S.-origin content because of\nthe unilateral regulatory burdens that go with it. It's like squeezing\na handful of sand too hard; eventually you have none. So, if the\nmultilateral process is too slow, come with other ideas with close\nallies to speed it up, such as by working with smaller groups of truly\ninterested countries. If they do not have the same concerns regarding\nChina, provide the evidence to convince them. If their enforcement\nsystems are lax, help them build capacity. All such tasks require\nmassive additional funding for BIS and the other export control\nagencies to implement properly.\nChina-Specific Licensing Policies in ECRA and the EAR\nECRA did not change any policies regarding exports to China.\nSection 4818, however, required a review of the licensing requirements\npertaining to China and other countries subject to U.S. arms embargoes.\nSection 4818(b) required the results of the review to be implemented by\nMay 10, 2019. I do not know the results of the effort. I know that\nindustry is curious about what the changes will be though. I am not\nsaying that any particular new control is or is not warranted. Rather,\nI am just reporting that many are wondering what the impact on their\nbusinesses will be and how BIS will justify any new controls based on\nthe ECRA standards described above.\nECRA requires that licensing requirements be imposed on exports of\nemerging and foundational technologies if destined to China or other\ncountries subject to arms embargoes. ECRA leaves to BIS the decision to\nimpose licensing requirements involving other countries. Also, unless\nBIS changes a core element of the EAR, these licensing requirements\nwill also apply to ``deemed exports,'' i.e., releases of technology in\nthe United States to nationals of countries that have a license\nrequirement, such as China.\nIn thinking about possible changes in licensing policy with respect\nto China, it is important to remember that almost all multilaterally\ncontrolled items already require a license for export to China and the\nExecutive Branch has wide latitude in deciding whether and when to\napprove, condition, or deny such licenses. BIS does not make such\ndecisions alone, by the way. They are made in coordination with its\ncolleagues in the departments of Defense, State, and Energy. If there\nis a disagreement among the agencies, there are formal appeal\nprocedures that have, in the main, worked well for decades. Reports of\nDefense or State officials being routinely ``overruled'' by Commerce\nofficials in final determinations during such procedures are untrue.\nThe following are additional already-existing China-specific export\ncontrols and licensing policies in the EAR. BIS has the authority to\nimpose individual licensing requirements on the export of specific\ntypes of otherwise uncontrolled items in a transaction merely by\ninforming the exporter that a national security concern exists with\nrespect to the transaction. The EAR contain absolute and complete\nembargoes on the export of military and commercial space-related items\nto China, directly or indirectly. The EAR contain ``zero de minimis''\nrules with respect to foreign-made military items, of any significance,\nand commercial space-related items. This essentially means that a\nforeign-made item containing any amount of U.S.-origin content\nspecially designed for a military or space-related item requires a\nlicense for export from outside the United States, which will be\npresumptively denied. Wholly foreign-origin items controlled for\nnational security reasons that are the direct product of U.S.-origin\ntechnology controlled for national security reasons also require a\nlicense from BIS to export to China and other countries of concern. BIS\nhas a process for conducting preshipment checks and postshipment\nverifications with respect to exports to China and other countries. If\nthe foreign companies do not cooperate, BIS has a process for exerting\nleverage over the foreign companies to cooperate, which is the\nUnverified List.\nChina-Specific Controls Based on End Users\nAs I mentioned earlier, the EAR can achieve their national security\nand foreign policy objectives through controls over lists of identified\nitems, specific end-users, or specific end-uses. It is not a one-size-\nfits all regulation. The EAR essentially have three end-user-based\ntools, which have often been used against entities in China and other\ncountries. They are (i) the Unverified List (to impose obligations on\nexports to determine the bona fides of a foreign entity or to allow for\nan end use check), (ii) the Denied Persons List (to impose punishment\nfor those that have violated the EAR); and (iii) the Entity List. The\nEntity List is a hot topic these days. It has, however, been a tool for\nBIS to use for decades. It is just getting much more attention because\nof the size and scale of the recent listings of Huawei and affiliated\nentities.\nThe list has hundreds of entities on it, many of which were added\nby me in coordination with my interagency colleagues. Obviously, as the\none who added ZTE to the Entity List in March of 2016, I believe that\nit can be an effective tool for accomplishing national security\nobjectives and supporting law enforcement efforts by motivating changes\nin the behavior of foreign parties engaged in acts contrary to our\nnational security or foreign policy interests--if there is a plan for\nwhat is to be achieved with the listing. Indeed, the standard in the\nEAR for when an entity is to be removed from the list is ``if it is no\nlonger engaged in [such activities] and is unlikely to engage in such\nactivities in the future.''\nBeing added to the Entity List is thus not an assessment of a civil\nor criminal penalty against the listed entity. The burden of proof for\nlisting is lower than even that for a standard civil penalty. The EAR\nrequires only that there be a ``reasonable cause to believe, based on\nspecific and articulable facts,'' that a foreign entity has been\ninvolved, is involved in, or poses a significant risk of being or\nbecoming involved in, ``activities that are contrary to the national\nsecurity or foreign policy interests of the United States.'' Neither\nECRA nor the EAR define or limit what constitutes a ``national\nsecurity'' or ``foreign policy'' interest with respect to the Entity\nList. The EAR contains an ``illustrative list'' of ``examples'' of such\nactivities, such as supporting persons engaged in acts of terror;\nenhancing the military capability of State sponsor of terrorism;\ntransferring, developing, servicing, repairing, or producing weapons;\npreventing BIS from conducting an end-use check; and posing a risk of\nviolating the EAR, such by transferring items to proscribed\ndestinations, end uses, and end users. The decision, however, is up to\nwhoever is in charge and the interagency clearance process as described\nin the EAR.\nMy view, based on the structure of the EAR and my experience, is\nthat the Entity List tool should be used to change the behavior of\nforeign entities and not just as a low burden-of-proof tool of\npunishment. Otherwise, the risk of its being over-used, and thus\nprovoking uncertainty about which entities it might be used against,\nprovokes concerns by foreign buyers that U.S. exporters are not\nreliable and predictable suppliers. Remember, in international trade,\nperception is as important as reality and must be managed accordingly.\nWith these comments, I am not challenging any of the recent Entity List\nactions or saying that a foreign company can be too big to list. Also,\nI, of course, no longer have access to the same nonpublic information\nmy successors at BIS have, thus making it hard for me to judge many\nissues. Rather, I am reporting that, given the recent notoriety of the\ntool, it is having an impact on otherwise authorized trade with China\ninvolving unaffiliated and benign end uses and end users. This effect\nwarrants study so that the mere existence of the otherwise effective\ntool does not end up doing more harm than good for U.S. industry.\nOf course, if a foreign entity has violated the EAR, then it should\nabsolutely be charged and punished consistent with the standards,\nprocedures, and due process set out in the EAR and the relevant\ncriminal code provisions. Moreover, I advocate for more enforcement\nresources for BIS's Office of Export Enforcement (OEE). OEE is unique\namong law enforcement agencies in that it is dedicated solely to\ninvestigating and assisting in the prosecution of export control cases.\nInvestigating exports and other activities involving China has always\nbeen among its top priorities given the diversion risk concerns\ndescribed earlier. I know that advocacy for more enforcement resources\nmay seem to be a counterintuitive suggestion from someone now in\nindustry, but robust enforcement helps keep the playing field level for\nthose companies that do the hard work to establish procedures to ensure\ncompliance with the controls.\nThe EAR prohibit exports of a list of otherwise uncontrolled items\nto Russia or Venezuela if for a ``military end user.'' Such a\n``military end user'' control with respect to China was not adopted\nduring the Bush administration because, as a I recall, of the\ndifficulty in identifying such end users when they are engaged in\npurely civilian activities, such as running hospitals and airports. I,\ntoo, was not able to come up with a clear definition of the term that\nexporters could comply with, but suspect BIS is now working on the\nissue given the requirements of ECRA to review China licensing\npolicies.\nChina-Specific Controls on End Uses\nThe EAR, however, contain a China military end use rule. In\nessence, it requires an exporter, reexporter, or transferor to apply\nfor a license when it knows that an item on a list of 32 types of items\nthat do not ordinarily require a license for export to China are for a\nmilitary end use in China. Such items include civilian aircraft\nengines, navigation systems, certain composite materials, and\ntelecommunications equipment. Applications for such exports will be\npresumptively denied. BIS also has the authority to inform an exporter\nthat there is an unacceptable risk that an item will be diverted for a\nmilitary end use in China and that, as a result, the item may not be\nshipped without a license.\nECRA permits other end use controls. This makes sense because, as\nprevious technology control identification efforts have demonstrated,\ndetailed technical descriptions of specific new technologies for\ninclusion on control lists can sometimes end up doing more harm than\ngood. If, for example, a technology is the same as that which is used\nto commit a bad act as is used to defend against the bad act, then a\nlist-based control and all the regulatory complexity that goes with it\nwill harm the defenders far more than the attackers. The solution for\nwhen list-based controls would be ineffective, or would do more harm\nthan good, is to focus on the end uses of concern. When someone in\nGovernment or civil society identifies concerns with such widely\navailable items, the concern is generally more about how they are being\nused and who is using them than something inherently threatening in the\ncommodity, software, or technology.\nAlthough not exclusive to China, the EAR contain a series of\ncontrols on exports, reexports, and transfers related to nuclear,\nmissile, and chemical/biological end uses. As referenced in ECRA and as\nimplemented in EAR section 744.6, the EAR also already control a range\nof services performed by U.S. persons if with respect to missiles,\nnuclear explosive devices, or chemical/biological weapons--regardless\nof whether the items involved in the service are subject to the\njurisdiction of the EAR. Although there are no China-specific end-use\ncontrols in the EAR or ECRA, ECRA section 4812(a)(2)(F) requires the\nPresident to ``control the activities of United States persons,\nwherever located, relating to specific . . . foreign military\nintelligence services.'' Congress presumably added this requirement to\nnarrow a gap between the ITAR's controls on defense services and\nservices that do not involve defense articles but still warrant control\nfor national security reasons. BIS has not yet implemented this control\nin the EAR. When it does, the addition may address some of the China-\nspecific policy concerns I am aware of. I would thus encourage the\nCommittee to study and track the provision's implementation. When I\nconsidered implementing a similar idea in the EAR, I was unable to\ndevelop a definition of foreign intelligence services that accomplished\nthe policy objectives of the control and that also would be\nunderstandable to those who would need to comply with it.\nHong Kong\nThe United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 effectively requires\nthe U.S. Government to treat Hong Kong and mainland China as two\nseparate destinations for export control purposes. In addition, section\n103(8) of the Act states that the ``United States should continue to\nsupport access by Hong Kong to sensitive technologies controlled under\n[the then existing multilateral export control regime that is the\npredecessor to the Wassenaar Arrangement] for so long as the United\nStates is satisfied that such technologies are protected from improper\nuse or export.'' Because the United States has not made a determination\nto the contrary, the statutory and regulatory prohibitions pertaining\nto the export and reexport of controlled items subject to U.S.\njurisdiction that are applicable to mainland China do not apply if the\ndestination is Hong Kong. The export control regulations, however,\nstill require licenses to export and reexport controlled items to Hong\nKong. Applications for such exports and reexports are reviewed by U.S.\nGovernment export control authorities to determine, for example,\nwhether Hong Kong is indeed the ultimate destination and whether the\nexport or reexport otherwise presents any national security or foreign\npolicy concerns.\nI was asked to comment on whether items subject to U.S. export\ncontrols are being illegally exported out of Hong Kong to mainland\nChina or other countries of concern. I left the Government on January\n20, 2017, and thus no longer have access to such information, whether\npositive or negative. I can, however, say that on January 19, 2017, a\nrule that I signed expressing concerns about the issue remains in\neffect. The rule imposes additional support document requirements on\nexports and reexports to Hong Kong. In essence, the rule leveraged the\nEAR to effectively compel compliance with Hong Kong export and import\npermit requirements by requiring proof of compliance with Hong Kong law\nas a support document necessary for shipping under an EAR license or\nlicense exception. As stated in the preamble, BIS took ``this action to\nprovide greater assurance that U.S.-origin items that are subject to\nmultilateral control regimes . . . will be properly authorized by the\nUnited States to the final destination [such as mainland China], even\nwhen those items first pass through Hong Kong.'' My thought at the time\nwas that if we had regular, robust assurances and intelligence that\ndiversions of U.S.-origin items were not occurring, then the additional\nrequirements would remain in effect as is or be removed. If not, then\nthe stricter licensing policies, including policies of presumptive\ndenials, would need to be imposed. I would encourage you to ask this\nquestion of current BIS officials.\nECRA Authorizes the Tools in the EAR To Be Used To Further U.S. Foreign\nPolicy, Including Human Rights, Objectives\nMost of my comments pertain to national security issues. ECRA,\nhowever, specifically authorizes the EAR to be used as a tool to\n``carry out the foreign policy of the United States, including the\nprotection of human rights and the promotion of democracy.'' The EAR\nalso contains an extensive list of foreign policy controls. Items\ncontrolled under such policies include crime control and detection\nequipment, restraints, stun guns, instruments of torture, equipment for\nexecutions, and shotguns. Following the 1989 military assault on\ndemonstrators by the Chinese Government in Tiananmen Square--30 years\nago today--the U.S. Government imposed controls on many such items.\nAll license applications BIS receives to export such and other\ntypes of items are reviewed by BIS foreign policy experts and also\nreferred to the State Department for its assessment of the foreign\npolicy and human rights implications. (With one exception involving a\ncomplex, atypical fact pattern with national security implications, I\nam confident that the State Department's assessment that a license\nshould be denied for human rights-related reasons has never been\nrejected by BIS and the other agencies.) Because, however, the nature\nof most items involved in acts contrary to this ECRA provision are\ncommon or do not lend themselves to technical descriptions on control\nlists, a combination of the EAR's other end-use- and end-user-based\ntools could be effective in furthering its objectives. I recognize that\nthe Entity List is not commonly used to further such objectives, but it\ncould be. I make this point only to respond to a likely request to\nexplain the tools in the EAR available to address various human rights\nconcerns.\nThe Need for Certainty, Clarity, and Multilateralism in Export Control\nPolicy--And How Perception Is Sometimes More Important Than\nReality\nAs someone who now hears concerns of U.S. industry on a billable\nhour-by-hour basis, I can report that there is considerable concern\nthat the United States will begin imposing broad controls on the large\ncategories of commercial emerging technologies identified in BIS's\nNovember request for information for nontraditional national security\nreasons. I am not saying controls consistent with ECRA's standards and\nrequirements should not be imposed. Rather, I am just reporting that\nmost companies do not appreciate that BIS's notice was a request for\npublic input and information about broad categories of technologies in\norder for BIS to use in considering how to develop narrowly tailored\ncontrols essential to national security. They also generally do not\nappreciate that there are specific statutory standards governing the\neffort and what technologies may and may not be added to the control\nlists. Because perception can, however, become reality with respect to\neconomic decisions involving U.S. companies, my recommendation is that\nBIS describe its plans for new China-specific controls publicly with\nclarity, certainty, and with as much ECRA-consistent emphasis on\nmultilateral solutions as possible. This is vital to reducing\nuncertainty, and thus unnecessarily lost business opportunities for\nU.S. companies involving benign items, among those who do not follow\nthe nuances of the EAR, ECRA, and the regulatory process.\nI acknowledge this will be difficult even when BIS is ready to\npublish proposed rules. However, ECRA essentially requires BIS to\ndemonstrate, for example, why any new proposed unilateral emerging\ntechnology control is ``essential'' to national security, why it would\nnot harm domestic research, and why it would be effective at stemming\nthe proliferation of such controls to China and other countries of\nconcern. BIS now, per ECRA, also must fully consider the impact on the\nU.S. economy that would result from any new unilateral control, an\neffort that it will need industry's help in doing. These are high\nstandards, but Congress created them because, as stated several times\nin ECRA, unilateral controls should be rare and only respond to\nspecific or emergency situations essential to our national security.\nAll other list-based controls are better addressed through the regular\norder and the well-tested process of working with our multilateral\nregime partners to develop and implement multilateral controls to\nenhance their effectiveness and keep the United States on a level\nplaying field with such countries, particularly with respect to\ncommercial technologies.\nConclusion\nThe United States has always pursued two complementary objectives--\nprotecting our national security and promoting U.S. technology\nleadership. While they both make us stronger, they have very different\ntools and purposes. We have spent 50 years building a global trading\nsystem with clear rules and tools for remedying unfair trade practices.\nExport controls are not one of them. If we use export control-related\nnational security justifications for purely trade policy purposes, we\nwill undermine the system we have built and even further encourage the\nChinese Government to do so even more. Export controls should be used\nto their fullest possible extent, however, when a specific national\nsecurity or foreign policy issue pertains to the export, reexport, or\ntransfer of commodities, technologies, software, or services to\ndestinations, end users, or end uses. If the issue pertains to an\nactivity, an investment, or a concern separate from such events or\nconcerns, then one must look to other areas of law, such as sanctions,\ntrade remedies, foreign direct investment controls, intellectual\nproperty theft remedies, or counterespionage laws. In addition, a trade\nagreement among Pacific allies surrounding China could be a useful tool\nin motivating, through collective multilateral action, changes in\nunfair Chinese trade activities--while, at the same time, benefiting\nU.S. industry's access to such markets and projecting American labor\nand environmental protection values.\nReturning to the title of the hearing--assessing controls on\ninvestments and technology relevant to threats involving China--the key\nto doing so properly is more funding for more people in BIS and the\nother export control agencies to regularly and aggressively conduct and\nimplement such assessments. In light of broad grants of authority in\nECRA and FIRRMA, I do not yet believe more law is needed to do so. The\nissues and technologies involving China are more complex than ever and\nthe need for multilateral cooperation, which is time intensive,\ncontinues to remain extremely important to the controls' effectiveness.\nI believe that each agency is understaffed when compared to its\nmission. Among other things, this leads to increased burdens and delays\nfor industry, reduced time needed for internal training, insufficient\ntime to study all the issues; and the inability to keep the regulations\ncurrent. Failure to keep the regulations current to novel threats does\nnot advance our national security interests and harms our economic\nsecurity.\nA renewed attention to supporting these organizations should\ninclude efforts to educate the next generation of export control\nprofessionals and to motivate them to join the Federal Government.\nDecades of wisdom and collective memory will walk out the door when\ncurrent senior career staff retire or otherwise leave the Government.\nIn addition, I would advocate that the export control agencies have\neasier hiring authority, more staff to conduct reviews of open source\nand intelligence community data, more intel analysts, more licensing\nofficers with advanced technical skills, and more staff with foreign\nlanguage skills, particularly Chinese. Congress was helpful in\nsubstantially increasing our budget when I was at BIS, for which I am\ngrateful, but more is needed.\nAs with all export control topics, I have a 3-minute, a 30-minute,\na 3-hour, and a 3-day version. So, with this, I'll stop here and be\nhappy to answer whatever questions you have.\n______\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF SCOTT KENNEDY\nSenior Adviser, Freeman Chair in China Studies, and Director, Project\non Chinese Business and Political Economy, Center for Strategic and\nInternational Studies\nJune 4, 2019\nIntroduction\nToday's hearing is about issues of technology, economics, public\nhealth, and national security, but it is occurring against the backdrop\nof the 30th anniversary of the Beijing massacre. This is a solemn day\nnot just in Chinese history, but in world history. I was a 4th-year\nundergraduate student at the University of Virginia when the protests\nbroke out and was preparing for language study in Taiwan when the\nevents of June 3rd and 4th unfolded. China confounded expectations\nthen, and it has since. Few expected a regime to take such actions, and\nfew expected it to survive and become the major power that it is today.\nIn so many ways, big and small, China continues to defy expectations.\nAs someone who cares deeply about China, the United States, and the\nglobe, one of the largest lessons I take from my years of working on\nChina and U.S.-China relations is our need to adopt a posture of\nprincipled pragmatism: we need to be guided by our values, but we also\nneed to be smart in how we pursue them. A clear purpose needs to be\nmarried to well-reasoned and effective policy. Our purpose should be to\nencourage and press for humane governance in China domestically and its\nresponsible behavior internationally. Pursuing these goals requires a\ncombination of engagement with China, deterrence and opposition to some\nof its policies and actions, and collaboration with friends and allies\nin the Asia-Pacific and beyond. But most importantly, success requires\nmaking America the best it can be. Our direct effect on China will\nalways be limited. We have a much greater ability to make our own\neconomic, social and political systems stronger, serve as a model for\nothers, and have them recognize how their national interests are best\nserved by having a good relationship with the United States.\nI elaborate on these principles in my statement as they apply to\nadvanced technology. I first briefly describe China's ambitious policy\ngoals in promoting high technology and the array of policies it is\ndeploying toward these ends. I then summarize the results to date and\nlikely future trajectory. The main point is that although China has\nmade progress and is likely to continue to do so, there is wide\nvariation across industries in the level of success and the effect on\nthe United States and global economy. On this foundation, I turn to\ndiscuss America's current policy approach in responding to China's\nhigh-tech drive. Presently, the United States is only utilizing a\nsingle policy tool--bilateral brinksmanship--and this approach has\nlimited utility. To be more effective, the United States will need an\n``all-of-the-above'' approach that involves greater coordination with\nfriends and allies and much more attention to strengthening the\nfoundations of our own technology ecosystem.\nChina's High-Tech Drive: Ambitions and Tools\nChina's technology goals are amazingly ambitious. Its leaders are\nno longer satisfied being a low-cost assembly point along the global\nsupply chain and only utilizing Western technology. \\1\\ China wants to\nbe a major high-tech leader. Although the Made-in-China 2025 (MC2025)\ntechnology plan focuses on a small handful of technologies, MC2025 is\npart of China's 13th Five-Year Plan, and this plan includes dozens of\nindustrial policies and hundreds of advanced technology sectors, from\nartificial intelligence and information and communications technologies\n(ICT) to commercial aircraft, and from materials to new-energy vehicles\nand pharmaceuticals. Beijing's motivation is multifold; it has a clear\neconomic logic, seeking to move from low-valued added segments of\nindustries to higher-value added parts of industries, spur consumption\nand improve the lives of its people, all of which together should raise\nChina's long-term growth prospects.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Scott Kennedy ``The Beijing Playbook: Chinese Industrial\nPolicy and Its Implications for the United States'', in James Andrew\nLewis, ed., Meeting the China Challenge (Washington, DC: CSIS, January\n2018), pp. 1-9.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBut the leadership also views advanced technologies in political\nand international terms. China wants to use technology to improve\ndomestic governance, for example, by making traffic move more\nefficiently, reducing crime, and improving coordination across\nGovernment agencies. It also wants to reduce domestic security risks,\npeople and movements that could threaten the Chinese Communist Party's\n(CCP) hold on power. Developing and acquiring advanced technologies\nalso serves China's national security goals, making China's military\nbetter able to defend its borders and near-abroad and have power\nprojection capabilities. This gives China the ability to deter\npotential foes, including the United States, in times of peace, as well\nas better prepare for potential conflicts along its perimeter,\nincluding the border with India, the Korean peninsula, Taiwan Strait,\nand South China Sea.\nJust as the motivations behind China's high-tech drive are\nmultifold, it is drawing on all the powers of the State and society to\nachieve them. Most importantly, although Beijing employs markets to\ncarry out research and development (R&D), promote industries, and\ncreate consumer services, the Chinese State--the Government and CCP, at\nthe national and local levels--is deeply involved in every aspect of\nthis drive.\nThere are five important principles guiding the Chinese State's\nrole: (1) The State has the right to intervene at any time for any\nreason; (2) State officials have discretion to adopt discrete policies\nto promote or hinder any industry, company or region as necessary; (3)\nFunding and investment for priority sectors often occurs in the\nexpectation of future demand, not existing demand already reveal by\nmarket signals; (4) The State would prefer to direct support to firms\nthat are both politically safe and economically competent, but special\nsupport goes to State-owned enterprises (SOEs) even when they do not\nperform well; and (5) Strategically use globalization to China's\nadvantage, not as an end in itself. \\2\\ The Chinese State does\nencourage business competition, even internationally, and in some\nindustries it is extremely fierce, but competition occurs within this\nlarger political economy, and so it is controlled with the explicit\nhope of achieving specific economic and political goals.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\2\\ Barry Naughton, ``China's Distinctive System: Can It Be a\nModel for Others?'' Journal of Contemporary China, no. 65 (2010), pp.\n437-460.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOn the basis of these motivations and guiding principles, the\nChinese State mobilizes every tool at its disposal to achieve these\nends. Funding is at the heart of the system, including Government\nspending, subsidies, and State-directed bank credit. China's securities\nmarkets as well as private equity and venture capital are a growing\npart of the equation, particularly with regard to advanced\ntechnologies. High-tech firms receive tax benefits, access to low-cost\nland and other incentives. China now spends over 2 percent of gross\ndomestic product (GDP) on R&D, equal to the average of advanced\nindustrialized countries. In absolute terms, it has the world's second\nlarge R&D budget, only behind the United States. In some industries,\nits investment outpaces that of everyone else. Although over 75 percent\nof R&D is by companies, the State is still able to incentivize and\ndirect spending in its priority areas. For example, in the case of\nsemiconductors, national and local governments have created a series of\ninvestment funds that total at least $150 billion. They are supporting\nthe creation of dozens of fabrication facilities around the country\neven though a straightforward market analysis would suggest this scale\nof investment is wasteful.\nBeyond finances, there is a rich panoply of interwoven policy tools\navailable to promote advanced technology: extensive support for\nuniversities and vocational schools to develop more talent, active\nparticipation in setting technical standards, Government procurement\nthat encourages or mandates buying Chinese products, and high\nenvironmental performance standards. China has a love-love approach to\nintellectual property (IP). On the one hand, it would love Chinese to\ndevelop their own IP. It has developed world-class IP laws and\nregulations, encouraged the filing of patents and copyrights at\nunprecedented levels, developed regulatory systems and markets for\nlicensing IP, and developed courts to adjudicate IPR disputes, most of\nwhich occur between domestic litigants. On the other hand, if it runs\ninto obstacles creating IP domestically, it would love to obtain this\nIP from abroad, legally if possible, illegally if necessary. Most\nindependent analysts believe China is the largest source of commercial\nIP theft globally, no longer focused on toys and CDs, but instead on\neverything from advanced materials to commercial aircraft components,\ndrug formulas, and telecom systems.\nA key element of China's high-tech drive is its strategic use of\nglobalization. In addition to sending millions of students abroad over\nthe last few decades to obtain advanced degrees in engineering and\nscience, Chinese financial institutions and companies have ramped up\noutward investment and acquisition of overseas companies. Cumulative\nChinese investment in the United States from 1990 to 2018 was $145.14\nbillion. Of this amount, 92 percent were acquisitions of existing\nAmerican companies, and 75 percent of investment was by private Chinese\ncompanies. High-tech is a huge part of Chinese investment; energy and\nICT have received a great deal of attention, but in the last 2 years,\nbecause of restrictions in those sectors, a higher proportion of\nfunding has flowed into pharmaceuticals, biotech, and health care. \\3\\\nBeyond investment abroad, Chinese companies also are opening R&D\ncenters in Silicon Valley and other high-tech hubs around the world.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\3\\ Rhodium Group, ``U.S.-China Investment Hub'', https://www.us-\nchina-investment.org/us-china-foreign-direct-investments/data; and\nThilo Hanemann, et al., ``Two-Way Street: 2019 Update'', May 2019,\nhttps://arraysproduction-0dot22.s3.amazonaws.com/rhodiumgroup/assets/\nicon/RHG-TWS-2019-Full-Report-8May2019.pdf.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDomestically, China has increased efforts to attract foreign talent\nto work for Chinese industry and uses the leverage of its large\ndomestic market to persuade foreign companies to share their technology\nwith local partners. As a consequence, China has been able to\nameliorate the weaknesses of its own top-down innovation system by\nutilizing innovation nurtured in more hospitable environments. And\nfinally, China has stepped up its efforts to shape global rules to\nlegitimate its current system of economic governance and make decisions\nconsistent with its own interests. China is deeply active in the G20,\nWTO, IMF, standards-setting bodies, and other existing institutions. It\nis also building alternative or parallel institutions, such as the\nAsian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and advocating competing\nnorms, such as Internet sovereignty, that better fit with its less\nliberal worldview.\nAlthough China certainly has regulations and policies that\ncontravene its commitments to the WTO and the United States, it makes\ngreater use of discriminatory policies and behaviors that less\nobviously violate international rules. Chinese officials and companies\nhave learned (in part from Western practice) how to ``game'' the\nsystem. The WTO covers many areas, but is far from comprehensive, and\nthe global standards for finance, currency, antitrust, the digital\neconomy, and elsewhere are either too vague or lack ``teeth'' to ensure\ncompliance. Moreover, even in areas covered by the WTO, China can mask\nindustrial policy as private commercial activity. For example, beyond\nofficial subsidies the State can decisively shape the decisions of\ncreditors, investors, and borrowers in ways that fit its interests and\ncreate an entirely uneven playing field. Masking industrial policy\nmakes it much harder to identify and constrain.\nChina's ambitions, motivations, policy tools, and approach toward\nglobalization all come together particularly tightly in the context of\ninformation and communications technologies, the Internet and\ncybersecurity. Developing the Internet and related technologies serves\neconomic, domestic security, and national security goals\nsimultaneously. Chinese President and Communist Party chief Xi Jinping\nhas repeatedly emphasized the multiple roles of the Internet and the\nimportance of cybersecurity. For example, in a major 2016 speech, he\nsaid: ``We have to take the initiative in the Internet development in\nour country. In order to protect cyber security and national security,\nwe have to overcome the bottleneck of core technology. (We should)\nstrive to leapfrog in certain areas and aspects.'' \\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\4\\ ``Speech to Cyber Security and Informatization Work Seminar'',\nPeople's Daily, April 20, 2016, http://cpc.people.com.cn/n1/2016/0420/\nc64094-28289000.html.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChina's famed ``social credit system'' as well as its smart-cities\nand safe-cities programs serve multiple purposes. Collecting data about\nyour finances and acquaintances may uncover unpaid bills that make you\na high-risk borrower or genuine criminal behavior, but could also be\nused to determine your political leanings and if you are likely to take\nto the streets. Developing telecom hardware and mobile technologies\nmakes economic activity far more efficient and connects businesses and\nconsumers, but it also gives the CCP and China's intelligence agencies\ngreater understanding of potential opponents, at home and abroad. China\nhas developed a complex and multifaceted policy and regulatory\nscaffolding for managing every aspect of the Internet and\ncybersecurity. While much of this would be needed in any circumstance,\nAmerican industry and independent observers view much of this effort as\noverly burdensome and discriminatory. \\5\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\5\\ Samm Sacks and Manyi Kathy Li, ``How Chinese Cybersecurity\nStandards Impact Doing Business in China'', CSIS Briefs, August 2018,\nhttps://www.csis.org/analysis/how-chinese-cybersecurity-standards-\nimpact-doing-business-china.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Mixed Results of China's High-Tech Drive\nChina's ambitions are one thing, the actual results another. In\ngeneral, China has made substantial progress in developing advanced\ntechnologies. In the most recent data provided by the Global Innovation\nIndex, China has moved up to rank 17th among the 126 countries it\ntracks. \\6\\ This index includes over 100 metrics related to both inputs\n(such as financing and education) as well as outputs (scientific\npublications, patents, and new products). China has separated itself\nfrom other developing countries, such as Brazil and Russia, and has\nmoved closer to the United States (6th), Germany (9th), South Korea\n(12th), and Japan (13th). \\7\\ China is now the world's largest source\nof patents, granting over 2.44 million patents in 2018. \\8\\ Even if a\nlarge percentage are not reflective of truly innovative activity, a\ngrowing proportion are. It is no longer accurate to see the Chinese\nsimply as a bunch of copycats. \\9\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\6\\ ``Global Innovation Index'', https://\nwww.globalinnovationindex.org/Home.\n\\7\\ Scott Kennedy, ``The Fat Tech Dragon: Benchmarking China's\nInnovation Drive'' (Center for Strategic and International Studies,\nAugust 2017), https://www.csis.org/analysis/fat-tech-dragon.\n\\8\\ ``China's National Intellectual Property Administration'',\nMonthly Report December 2018, http://www.sipo.gov.cn/docs/2019-01/\n20190129105822724812.pdf.\n\\9\\ Shaun Rein, ``The End of Copycat China: The Rise of\nCreativity, Innovation and Individualism in Asia'' (Wiley, 2014); and\nKai-Fu Lee, ``AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World\nOrder'' (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThat said, there is a great deal of variation across sectors. In\nsome industries, Chinese firms are doing exceptionally, creating\ninnovations at an impressive rate. This is particularly true in ICT,\nfrom telecom equipment and handsets to Internet applications. This is\nin part because the technology barriers to entry in the Internet are\nlower than other sectors--you need a laptop and some coding skills--but\nit also a product of this sector being dominated by private companies.\nWe know of larger firms such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu, but there\nare hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of ICT start-ups, and they\nare part of a rich ecosystem of money, talent, and services that span\nthe country and beyond.\nChina's pharmaceutical sector has been far less successful, but its\nprospects are relatively robust compared to many other industries\nbecause of the kinds of talent and firms entering the sector. Pharma is\nthe most globalized of any Chinese industry. Most company founders and\ntop researchers have studied in the United States and Europe and are\ndeeply familiar with the pharma industry, the entire drug development\nprocess, and the regulatory systems developed by the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA). Many of these firms have raised funds from\nAmerican venture capital firms and have deep relationships with one or\nmore of the leading Western pharma firms.\nIn contrast to sectors such as these, there are another group of\nhigh-tech industries in China that have seen some success, but at a\ntremendous cost. In these sectors, China has developed technology at\nhome or acquired it from abroad, and then pushed massive investments to\nscale-up the industries. But in the process, they have attracted far\ntoo many firms and investment, with the result being mediocre\ntechnological progress but outrageous levels of overcapacity. This kind\nof problem originally emerged in industries such as steel, aluminum,\nglass, and paper, but in the last decade have spread to several high-\ntech sectors. Solar, wind, electric vehicles, and robotics are the most\nobvious, but overcapacity affect those industries where products are\neasily standardized, and funding is easily available. The results are\nfast-growing industries, but ones where the vast majority of producers\nare nowhere near the cutting edge, and supply outstrips likely demand.\nThese industries are ripe for consolidation, but to avoid being stuck\nwith unsold inventories, there is a huge incentive for companies to\ndump their products abroad. The result of such competition\nunconstrained by the penalty of losing is to put companies that face\ntighter budget constraints at a huge disadvantage. These circumstances\nthreaten the vitality of supply chains and business models built on\nassumptions of a more competitive market environment.\nThe last group of high-tech sectors in China are those that have\nyet to succeed and do not show much promise, at least in the next\ndecade or so. These tend to be industries closer to the cutting edge,\nwith very high technology barriers to entry. But the Chinese compound\nthese difficulties by bringing the heavy hand of the State into play,\nin some instances dictating that State-owned firms must dominate or\nthat commercial activity must closely follow State guidelines.\nThe best example is commercial aircraft. China has developed a\nregional jet, the ARJ21, to compete with Bombardier and Embraer. The\nplane has been a bust. It was launched far behind schedule, and only\none airline currently has it in its fleet. Industry experts tell me\nthat the plane is extremely loud, and so passengers are given earplugs.\nIndividual aircraft are often grounded for maintenance. China has a\nsomewhat more promising narrow-body larger aircraft, the C919, in\ndevelopment. Aimed to compete against Boeing's 737 and the Airbus A320,\nthe C919 is technically an improvement over the ARJ21, but almost all\nof the critical technologies on the plane, from the avionics to the\nengines, are from the United States and Europe. Moreover, the plane is\nfar behind schedule, and even once the plane can go into commercial\noperation, it will take a long time for the Chinese to be able to fully\nservice an entire fleet. China also has a wide-body aircraft on the\ndrawing board, the CR929, but this plane is really just notional, and\nthere is a large chance it will never actually be developed. Wide-body\naircraft are far more complicated than single-aisle planes, and the\nmarket is already well developed. Moreover, by the time the CR929 might\nbe ready, the entire commercial aircraft industry may have moved on to\nnew technologies and business models. In short, particularly compared\nto other sectors, it feels as if in commercial aircraft, the Chinese\nare far behind and not making up ground quickly.\nWhy? To some extent, it is because of the inherent difficulty of\nthe industry. Planes have hundreds of thousands of parts, and they have\nto work together seamlessly and perfectly on every flight--in the air,\nwith no tolerance for mistakes. Moreover, fleets have to be serviced on\nan ongoing basis at amazingly high standards. But China has tackled\nother high-tech challenges of this complexity. What matters here is the\nweaknesses of the company China has assigned with this task, the\nCommercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC). COMAC is a subsidiary\nof the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), which is\nprimarily a defense contractor. AVIC and its subsidiaries work in a\nvery closed environment with little international engagement and few\nmarket signals. Like its parent, COMAC is hierarchical and internally\norganized in a way to inhibit information sharing and learning. COMAC\nhas hired a couple hundred international experts from leading companies\nand regulators, but they have little voice in company management and\ndecisions. As a result, China's prospects in commercial aircraft are\nparticularly dim. Eventually the C919 will likely be launched, and\nChina can require its domestic airlines to put the C919 into service,\nand this will provide a chance for learning and improvement. But it is\njust as likely that the C919 will run into substantial problems and be\na highly costly flop. \\10\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\10\\ Amanda Lee, ``China's Aviation Industry Has a Steep Climb to\n`Made in China 2025' Goals'', South China Morning Post, October 29,\n2018, https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2170746/chinas-aviation-\nindustry-has-steep-climb-made-china-2025-goals; David Fickling, ``China\nInc.'s Boeing Rival Just Won't Fly'', Washington Post, March 21, 2019,\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/china-incs-boeing-rival-just-\nwont-fly/2019/03/21/565b9bf6-4bad-11e9-8cfc-2c5d0999c21e-\nstory.html?utm-term=.91e7db913869.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThere are a variety of high-tech industries that have similar\nprospects in China. The other most obvious one is semiconductors. There\nhas been progress in some segments of the industry, but failure is far\nmore common than success, and China shows little likelihood of\nachieving leadership in the industry any time soon. \\11\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\11\\ James A. Lewis, ``Learning the Superior Techniques of the\nBarbarians: China's Pursuit of Semiconductor Independence'' (Center for\nStrategic and International Studies, January 2019), https://csis-\nprod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/190115-Lewis-\nSemiconductor-v6.pdf.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGiven this variation, it is inappropriate to see China as a high-\ntech superpower, but rather as an aggressive competitor with both\nsizeable strengths and substantial deficiencies. Hence, it does not\nmake sense to be either overly alarmist or comfortably dismissive of\nChina's high-tech ambitions. The truth is somewhere in the middle, and\nit requires taking an empirical approach and examining industries one-\nby-one.\nAmerican Policy\nIn a narrow sense, current American policy appears to overestimate\nChina's high-tech prowess, but it probably makes sense to err on the\nside of caution and prepare for a China that once again defies\nexpectations to overcome many of the challenges described above. That\nsaid, the Trump administration's approach to responding to China's\nhigh-tech challenge is overly focused on a single approach: pressure.\nThis stance is understandable given China's highly aggressive approach\nthat threatens the health of individual companies as well as entire\nindustry supply chains and business models. Under Xi Jinping China has\nmade some modest adjustments to market access in some industries, for\nexample, gradually reducing joint-venture requirements for automobiles\nand liberalizing access to its financial markets, but the overall\ntrajectory is one of greater control and discrimination against foreign\nindustry.\nThe United States is utilizing several tactics to put an immense\namount of pressure on China and try to leave it isolated. The first is\nraising tariffs across a wide range of industries in order to hurt the\neconomy's growth prospects. The U.S. has raised tariffs on three\nseparate occasions, with tariffs of 25 percent now covering half of\nAmerica's imports. The U.S. is now poised to place tariffs on the\nremainder of China's exports to the United States. The second component\nof this pressure strategy is to more directly deny China access to\nAmerican technology and markets. The U.S. passed reforms in 2018 to our\nlaws related to foreign investment and export controls, and these\nefforts are largely driven by concerns about China. The Committee for\nForeign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is expanding the range\nof industries and lowering the scale of investment that triggers a\nnational security review. The Commerce Department is developing broader\nrules to limit exports of foundational and emerging technologies. These\nrestrictions will include both physical technologies as well as\nindividual human talent, what is called ``deemed exports.'' Finally,\nthe U.S. has modestly adjusted its visa policies, making it harder for\nChinese graduate students in the sciences and engineering to gain\naccess to American universities, and also limiting people-to-people\nexchanges amongst working scientists and other experts. Overall numbers\nof students and professionals engaging in travel has not fallen much,\nbut the marginal effect has been quite noticeable.\nThis pressure approach has in the last few months been turned on\nspecific Chinese companies, the most important of which is Huawei.\nHuawei is by far China's most successful company, but it is still\nhighly dependent on suppliers from the United States and elsewhere for\nmany of its components. In August 2018 and January 2019 the Trump\nadministration issued two indictments against Huawei for violating\nsanctions against Iran and stealing American IP. In mid-May 2019 the\nAdministration issued an Executive Order banning any American entity\nfrom purchasing Huawei equipment (an expansion of the late-2018 step to\nban purchases by U.S. Government entities). At the same time it also\nplaced Huawei on an ``Entity List,'' denying it access to American-\nbased components. \\12\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\12\\ The White House, ``Executive Order on Securing the\nInformation and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain'',\nMay 15, 2019, https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/\nexecutive-order-securing-information-communications-technology-\nservices-supply-chain/; ``Addition of Entities to the Entity List,''\nFederal Register, May 21, 2019, https://www.federalregister.gov/\ndocuments/2019/05/21/2019-10616/addition-of-entities-to-the-entity-\nlist; and U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security,\nSupplement No. 4 to Part 744--Entity List, https://www.bis.doc.gov/\nindex.php/documents/regulations-docs/2326-supplement-no-4-to-part-744-\nentity-list-4/file.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIt is understandable for the United States to have lost patience\nwith China and utilize pressure as a way to force China to the\nnegotiating table as well as simply better protect American technology\ncentral to our national security. In fact, I grudgingly supported the\nAdministration's use of tariffs to capture China's attention and let it\nknow that the United States was willing to use its power to protect its\nnational interests and accelerate negotiations that would result in\nChina putting substantial constraints on its industrial policies to\nreduce the damage caused to individual companies, entire industries,\nand our national security.\nHowever, this approach has now gone too far and is in danger of\nbackfiring to the detriment of the American economy, U.S. national\nsecurity, and the global economy. Trade tariffs have already created a\ngreat deal of ``collateral damage,'' including a large number of\nAmerican farmers and companies who have lost export markets, and\nAmerican consumers who are paying higher prices for goods. If the\ntariffs on all Chinese goods go into effect, it may be the highest\nincrease in taxes on Americans since the early 1990s. Import tariffs\nare also highly regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income\npopulations. But as long as there was a chance China could be brought\nto the negotiating table to reach a good deal, these costs may have\nbeen worth the risk. But the line between risky and a huge mistake was\ncrossed when the U.S. placed Huawei on the ``Entities List.'' Huawei is\nno saint of a company, and the U.S. intelligence community has signaled\nreasonable alarm about the threat of having Huawei's 5G technology in\nAmerican networks and those of our allies. But the Entity List order\nwas drafted far too broadly. It is costing American companies billions\nof dollars in business in nonsensitive areas such as consumer\nelectronics. Equally important, the networks which are run on Huawei\nequipment are likely to become increasingly degraded and unstable in a\nmatter of months if not weeks. Huawei operates in 170 countries, with\nnetworks for mobile communications, health care, finance, and other\nindustries.\nThe U.S. does not so much as need to put aside an approach of\npressure so much as dial it back modestly and complement it with two\nother initiatives. The first would be to reduce tensions with other\ncountries who face the exact same challenges as the United States in\nChina. Our allies in Europe, Asia, and Latin America face the same\nproblems with IP theft and discriminatory policies from China. Instead\nof closely working together, the Trump administration has threatened or\nused tariffs against many of them. The global economy's largest\nchallenge is from China, not everyone that has a trade surplus with the\nUnited States. Greater coordination, formally and informally, would\nmake the choice for China far much clearer; the chances of it agreeing\nto serious reforms and engaging less in IP theft and other harmful\npractices would increase.\nFinally, the U.S. needs to strengthen its own ecosystem for\nadvanced technologies. Not only does the United States need to invest\nmore in R&D for basic sciences and applied technologies, there needs to\nbe greater investment in all levels of STEM education and physical\ninfrastructure. Equally important, in some instances the United States\nFederal and local governments need to do more to spur demand for\nleading technologies. In some sectors, American experts have created\nnew technologies only to find limited market interest at home. As a\nresult, some of them are lured to sell their technologies to Chinese\ninvestors, who have a market ready to scale-up these ideas. Electric-\ncar battery technology is an excellent example. The Department of\nEnergy's ARPA-E Program has supported such research, but some of the\nsuccessful results have been sold to or commercialized in China, not\nthe United States. This trajectory needs to be changed, not by\nmandating where technology can be used, but by creating commercial\nincentives for them in the United States. In 2018, China's electric car\nmarket was over 1.2 million vehicles; the American market was one-fifth\nthe size, and the gap will likely be larger in 2019 and beyond--unless\nthe U.S. Government helps modify incentives for both auto producers and\nconsumers.\nI am not calling for an all-out industrial policy. As Congressman\nRick Larsen (D-WA) recently declared, ``The United States does not need\nto `out-China' China; it needs to `out-U.S.' the U.S.'' That said, if\ndone carefully and humbly, the U.S. Government can promote new\ntechnologies with limited Government resources in a market-friendly\nway. And a more successful American high-tech sector is the best\nbulwark against the challenge from China.\n______\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF RICHARD NEPHEW\nFormer Principal Deputy Coordinator for Sanctions Policy, Department of\nState\nJune 4, 2019\nThank you, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and other\ndistinguished Members of this Committee for inviting me to speak here\ntoday. It is a privilege to offer my thoughts with respect to an issue\nthat is so important to the United States, namely the use of U.S.\nsanctions policy to address the problem of fentanyl abuse in the United\nStates and how those sanctions might affect U.S. relations with China.\nThe scope of the Committee's inquiry today is much broader than the\nFentanyl Sanctions Act (FSA) or, for that matter, the use of sanctions\nin general in addressing policy differences with the People's Republic\nof China. But, it may be an important part of this larger whole and I\nappreciate the opportunity to discuss these issues with you today. I am\nalso honored to join my fellow panelists here today who have long\nexperience in issues germane to this Committee's consideration.\nI'm particularly grateful that the Committee has decided to study\nand debate the issue of fentanyl sanctions rather than leap immediately\ninto the business of applying sanctions against entities in China or,\nfor that matter, any other country in which there are entities involved\nin fentanyl trafficking. I think the decision to explore sanctions as a\npossible means of securing additional leverage to manage the supply of\nfentanyl to the United States--and sanctions' active use in other\nforeign policy contexts with China--is fitting given the established\nutility of sanctions in managing other policy problems. However, as I\nhave written about extensively since I left Government in 2015,\nsanctions should neither be the only nor the dominant tool in managing\nevery foreign policy problem. There are real dangers in the overuse of\nsanctions and in the reduction of U.S. policy interests with key\ncountries--China foremost among them--to a sanctions management\nexercise.\nThat concern notwithstanding, I do think that the Fentanyl\nSanctions Act is an appropriate step forward in the redress of our\nconcerns with China in this regard. It has sound, clearly articulated\nobjectives. It offers a flexible approach that provides substantial\ndiscretion to the Executive Branch. It provides for proportional and\nlimited sanctions, and in a manner that is distinct from the existing\nsanctions structure, including the Kingpin Act. It can facilitate a\ndiplomatic approach, especially in that it is not limited solely to\nChina as a target. And, it is complemented by other steps--including\nthe creation of a commission, establishment of an intelligence program\ndedicated to the problem, and the provision of funding--that can help\nto create a ``whole of Government'' approach to the problem.\nIn this written testimony, I will outline further the key tests for\nthe development of a sanctions campaign that I believe the FSA passes\nas well as some legitimate concerns and challenges that exist for its\nsuccessful use and placement within the broader range of U.S.-China\nrelations.\nSanctions Tests\nThe FSA passes several tests for what I deem necessary in the\ndevelopment of a sanctions program. I should emphasize that my\nassessment is as a matter of sanctions design and implementation. I am\nnot an expert in synthetic opioids or their trafficking, about which I\nwould defer to others. I have found the community writing about this\nproblem to be insightful and want to acknowledge, in particular, the\nwritings of Liana Rosen and Susan Lawrence of the Congressional\nResearch Service, \\1\\ J. Stephen Morrison and Emily Foecke Munden of\nCSIS, \\2\\ and Vanda Felbab-Brown of Brookings \\3\\ \\4\\. Of course, the\nconclusions I reach regarding FSA are my own.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/IF10890.pdf\n\\2\\ https://www.csis.org/analysis/fentanyl-opens-grave-new-health-\nsecurity-threat-synthetic-opioids\n\\3\\ https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/04/30/\nhow-synthetic-opioids-can-radically-change-global-illegal-drug-markets-\nand-foreign-policy/\n\\4\\ https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/\nFP_20190322_mexico_crime-2.pdf\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFirst and foremost, the FSA has a specific objective in mind that\nit states clearly in Section 2's findings on the scourge of synthetic\nopioid use in the United States. In paragraph two, FSA states that\n``the objective of preventing the proliferation of synthetic opioids\nthough [sic] existing multilateral and bilateral initiatives requires\nadditional efforts to deny illicit actors the financial means to\nsustain their markets and distribution networks.'' In paragraphs 5-7,\nthe FSA acknowledges the ``important strides'' made by the United\nStates, China, Mexico, and Canada in combating the illicit flow of\nopioids but also that these efforts have been insufficient. It\nconcludes with a call for ``precision economic and financial sanctions\npolicy tools'' to complement these efforts as well as other sanctions\ntools presently on the books.\nBy establishing a clear predicate as well as a sense of purpose,\nthe text of the FSA offers a rationale for sanctions as well as their\nlimited use. Sanctions provided in the FSA are, by extrapolation, not\nintended to address non-opioid foreign policy problems nor are they\nintended to be used in the pursuit of broader political, economic, or\nsocial interests with respect to China, Mexico, or any other country\nfor that matter. As a consequence, were the FSA to pass and become law,\nthe United States would be able to offer exceptionally clear guidance\nas to why sanctions may become necessary, their rationale and their\npurpose.\nSecond, the FSA is also clear in identifying the targets of the\nsanctions--the companies, financial institutions, other entities, and\nindividuals involved in illicit trafficking of synthetic opioids--and\nthe steps that the Governments responsible for those companies can take\nto avoid the imposition of sanctions. In this way, the Act would grant\nsubstantial flexibility to the Executive Branch to undertake a\ndiplomatic campaign that is both multilateral in scope (the U.N., G7\nand other bodies are explicitly identified) as well as bilateral. The\nAct's explicit authorization of a broad, 12-month waiver of sanctions\nwith respect to financial institutions in countries identified as\nclosely cooperating with multilateral efforts to prevent trafficking is\nvaluable, as is the ability of the Executive Branch to invoke U.S.\nnational security, humanitarian or U.S. pharmaceutical needs in order\nto waive sanctions. This waiver is proportional and useful for\nsanctions implementation purpose, especially as it serves to\nincentivize cooperation at the highest multinational level. A similar\nwaiver for companies--in addition to financial institutions--that are\noperating in closely cooperating countries would also be useful and\nwould help harmonize implementation.\nThird, the FSA permits the Executive Branch to decide which\nsanctions would be most appropriate in which contexts rather than be\nlimited to a specific, prechosen menu. This may allow the President to\ndecide to tailor implementation to be comparatively lighter--as part of\nan inducement for cooperation--or comparatively harsher, in egregious\ncases. Either way, taken in combination with the waivers, the Executive\nBranch will be able to ensure that the use of sanctions matches the\npolicy objective of preventing the trade rather than seeking punishment\nfor punishment's sake.\nI should note in this context the important role that the Kingpin\nAct can play in managing this crisis but also the distinction that I\nsee between it and the FSA. The Kingpin Act is a very aggressive\nsanctions tool in that its one penalty is the blocking of assets and\nthereby the complete denial of economic access to the United States of\nany entity or individual designated under it. For many narcotics\ntraffickers, this may be an entirely appropriate tool: many such\nindividuals or entities are involved in widespread narcotics\ntrafficking and may be unlikely to moderate their behavior if presented\nwith a more modest sanctions threat. Moreover, the method of removing\nsanctions is likewise stark: designations can be rescinded but,\notherwise, sanctions imposed are usually sanctions that remain.\nLicenses can be granted to facilitate any necessary transactions but,\notherwise, the application of the Kingpin Act is blanket and\ncomprehensive in its effect.\nThe FSA, by contrast, is a far more flexible tool in both the\nsanctions that can be applied and in their method of relief. As noted,\nthe FSA offers many different paths for sanctions to be set aside,\nincluding for countries that demonstrate a serious and dedicated effort\nto address our fundamental concerns regarding the behavior of their\nentities. Additionally, though a formal designation and inclusion on\nthe U.S. Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list\nremains an option for sanctions under the FSA, there are also more\ndiscrete tools that can be employed, including prohibitions on imports,\ndenial of investment, and sanctions on the principal officers of\ncompanies involved. The FSA, therefore, gives the U.S. Government a\nwider, deeper toolbox to apply in addressing this problem that, when\ncoupled with a diplomatic strategy, may be more effective than simple\nreliance on the Kingpin Act. And, of course, Kingpin is not going away:\nit can still be used in the most egregious cases as well.\nFourth, and perhaps most important, though there is a heavy\nemphasis on China and Mexico in the findings, as well as in the context\nof our discussions here today (at least with regard to China), the bill\nitself does not focus on those two countries to the exclusion of the\nrest of the world. In this way, though China is an obvious country of\nattention, the sanctions proposed would have utility in addressing\nsimilar problems that either have or may emerge with other countries.\nThis is important in the context of potentially changing supply\ncircumstances, especially if China makes good on its commitments to\nreduce the illicit trade in fentanyl. Traffickers may adapt to Chinese\nimplementation by sourcing their wares elsewhere and, in my research\nfor this hearing, experts in fentanyl trafficking believe this may soon\noccur. The FSA wisely avoids being overly prescriptive in its selection\nof targets in this context. Moreover, by not explicitly singling out\nChina for sanctions, at least some of the diplomatic blow that might\notherwise be felt by the Chinese can be reduced, thereby preserving\nspace for negotiations on the topic itself.\nLast, the bill also provides a path away from sanctions. As noted\npreviously, the diplomatic route is explicitly marked for countries\nthat may find themselves the target of these sanctions. Implementation\nof the measures outlined in the bill will itself take time, enabling\ndiplomacy and avoiding the necessity for sanctions enforcement in\ntheory and, ideally, in practice. In this context, it would be helpful\nif the bill included explicit terms for the termination of sanctions\nagainst designated individuals and entities. As written, the bill would\nallow for designations to be removed every 180 days, with the\nsubmission of new reports on entities and individuals of concern. This\nmay be sufficient, but additional flexibility could be useful in a\nnegotiation. The FSA's invocation of IEEPA sections 203 and 205 (which\ninclude licensing and regulatory authorities) can help address this\nneed, if amendment of the bill itself is not desirable.\nSanctions in Context\nOf course, sanctions should not merely be evaluated on the basis of\ntheir nuts and bolts but also in their proper policy context. A\nsanctions bill that is well designed and executed may still not be\ndesirable, if used in a context that is otherwise disadvantageous to\nthe United States in some fashion. The question needs to be not whether\n``sanctions work'' but rather whether sanctions are the right tool for\nthe job at hand.\nIn my view, there are three considerations or challenges that need\nto be addressed in deciding whether to proceed with the FSA and the\ndiplomatic strategy that it would intend to support. (As this hearing\nis primarily focused on China and U.S.-China relations, I will\nconcentrate on this relationship specifically.) The three\nconsiderations and challenges are:\n1.  How FSA sanctions should be placed in the broader U.S.-China\nrelationship;\n2.  How FSA sanctions would be calibrated with other U.S. sanctions\npriorities; and,\n3.  Whether FSA contributes to the problem of sanctions overuse.\nBilateral Relations\nOne critique of the FSA is that it is adding to an already full\nroster of policy priorities with respect to China and that it would be\nunwise to create new problems in the relationship. In my opinion, this\nwould be fair if the FSA was picking up an issue with China that had\neither been resolved satisfactorily or was sufficiently distant so as\nnot to be a source of immediate concern. It would also be fair if the\nFSA's sanctions demands were so onerous as to make it practically\nimpossible for progress to be reached on the broader priority while\nsanctions were pending in this area.\nIn my view, neither of these factors is present today. The FSA is\nseeking to address a current problem for the United States that,\naccording to a variety of sources, is affecting the lives of millions\nof Americans. Though I am not an expert in fentanyl, the materials I\nconsulted prior to this testimony underscore the degree to which\noverdoses and the complications that are created in the families and\ncommunities of fentanyl's users are a crucial problem for the United\nStates. Moreover, this is a problem that has already been the subject\nof intense diplomacy between the United States and China and where\nprogress has been made even in the context of a tense relationship.\nChinese officials are already aware of U.S. concerns in this regard and\nhave taken steps to address some core U.S. demands, such as scheduling\nthe various fentanyl analogues that might have similar characteristics.\nTrue, if U.S. sanctions were to be eventually imposed on a variety\nof large Chinese financial or pharmaceutical firms, then the FSA could\nexacerbate existing tensions and difficulties. However, this is not the\nintent of the legislation, as I understand it. The intent is instead to\nconvince China of U.S. seriousness and to persuade Chinese officials,\nas well as the Chinese private sector, to take steps to address U.S.\nconcerns in this regard and to ensure that Chinese regulations on the\nsame are fully enforced. In fact, it is arguable that our sanctions\napproach is complementary to China's own efforts to crack down on this\ntrade given recent changes in how China schedules and controls opioids.\nIt is for this reason that I believe the flexibility and discretion\nprovided in the FSA is essential, but also why I believe sanctions in\nthis area can be accommodated with broader U.S. interests in China.\nCalibrating With Other Sanctions\nA slightly different issue is where the FSA fits in the broader\nscheme of U.S. sanctions involving China.\nTo put things mildly, the sanctions picture with regard to China is\ncongested. The United States has a wide range of sanctions in place\nthat affect Chinese interests, significantly so in some cases. A short\nlist includes:\nNorth Korea sanctions;\nIran sanctions, particularly with respect to oil exports;\nHuman rights sanctions, including Global Magnitsky\nmeasures;\nTechnology sanctions, including the newly announced\nExecutive Order measures against Huawei;\nRussia sanctions, particularly with respect to energy trade\nand financing;\nNonproliferation sanctions; and,\nSyria sanctions.\nTo put things in some context, there are 152 individuals or\nentities identified as being ``Chinese'' for purposes of U.S. sanctions\non the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list.\nThere are 174 North Korean entries. Another way of looking at the\nissue: in 2018, China was the number one trading partner of the United\nStates according to the U.S. Census Bureau. \\5\\ Canada, Mexico, Japan,\nand Germany round out the top five. With the exception of Mexico--which\nhas a very large number of resident narcotics traffickers subject to\nU.S. sanctions--U.S. designations of Chinese persons are nearly double\nthe total number of designations from the rest of the top five. This is\na relatively weak way to assess the volume and impact of U.S. sanctions\ndecisions, particularly as some measures imposed against China have not\nincluded an SDN designation. But, between the number of programs\ntouching upon China and the number of explicit designations, the\npicture is still one of a country that is subject to a diverse range\nand fairly robust scale of U.S. sanctions.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\5\\ https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/\ntop/top1812yr.html\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe point is simple: for such a significant trading partner of the\nUnited States as well as a significant economy internationally, the\nUnited States has imposed a lot of sanctions against China and\ncertainly plans to do more. For example, in this context, I take note\nof the recent bill introduced by Senators Rubio and Cardin--with a\nnumber of cosponsors--that would threaten sanctions against Chinese\nentities for their involvement in China's activities in the South China\nSea. \\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\6\\ https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/80e0c63e-\nb521-4929-a48c-db042c096d6a/26BE75C8B05BC1ECB3636E0C2AA42902.south-\nchina-sea.pdf\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI recognize that it is beyond the scope of this hearing to debate\nthe wisdom of some of the sanctions decisions that we have already made\nwith respect to Chinese interests or what may be planned (or, indeed,\nnot planned as the case may be). That said, it is necessary to step\nback and consider whether, in the broader sanctions policy context, we\nwould be over-burdening the sanctions agenda with respect to China if\nthe FSA were to become law.\nAs I have written extensively about since I left the U.S.\nGovernment in 2015, there are reasons to be concerned about the use of\nsanctions against China in particular (as well as overuse, in general,\nas I discuss below) \\7\\ beyond the overall foreign policy context. For\ninstance, at the most elementary level, the more the United States\nimposes sanctions against China and Chinese entities or individuals\n(for whatever reason), the greater the likelihood that China will\nitself elect to impose sanctions against U.S. interests. For better or\nworse, we have shown China that it is possible to maintain a trading\nrelationship with a country while still imposing targeted sanctions\nagainst particular entities and individuals located within it. The Iran\ncase is particularly salient, as the United States has designated\ndozens of entities and individuals in countries that range from U.S.\nallies like Germany to close partners like Israel and the UAE. China\nhas applied this lesson itself, though usually involving discrete\nissues and obviously smaller economies than the United States, and\nusing different means (e.g., with respect to the soft sanctions with\nrespect to South Korea's Lotte Group and Chinese citizen travel to\nSouth Korea after the THAAD deployment in 2016 \\8\\). Adding more\nsanctions to this saturated space will do nothing to convince China\nthat it should not develop similar capacities and continue to apply its\neconomic muscle.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\7\\ https://energypolicy.columbia.edu/research/report/future-\neconomic-sanctions-global-economy\n\\8\\ https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lotte-china-analysis/with-\nchina-dream-shattered-over-missile-land-deal-lotte-faces-costly-\noverhaul-idUSKBN1CT35Y\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe tit-for-tat nature of the trade war may already be reinforcing\nthis dynamic. A senior academic in China, Associate Dean Jin Canrong of\nthe School of International Studies at Renmin University, published an\neditorial on 15 May that explicitly encourages China to impose specific\nsanctions against the United States in response to the tariff decision\nmade by the President in mid May 2019. \\9\\ They echo measures\npreviously employed by China, such as a reduction on the export of rare\nearths to the United States, as well as suggest restrictions on U.S.\ncompanies' access to China. Regardless of what happens in trade talks,\nthe fact that Chinese academics are beginning to discuss more seriously\nthe idea of sanctions against the United States underscores the degree\nto which we ought to be careful when considering measures against China\nourselves.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\9\\ http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1150061.shtml\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThat said, there are sanctions and then there are sanctions. The\nmeasures proposed by the FSA are, as I've noted, proportional, modest\nand flexible. They are of a very different character than, for example,\na broad prohibition on the import of Iranian oil or on providing\nbanking services to Russian oligarchs. The ramifications for China are\ndifferent from these types of sanctions than what is envisioned under\nthe FSA. Moreover, as noted previously, there are enough off-ramps to\nsanctions that, if implemented alongside a patient, deliberate, and\nconcerted diplomatic strategy, the actual imposition of measures can\nand should be avoided.\nFurthermore, the acknowledgement of other sanctions priorities that\nexist should not and need not be an argument against having the ability\nto impose measures against illicit traffickers of fentanyl. Instead,\nthis is a reason for the United States to be more diligent and careful\nin its consideration of sanctions priorities more generally. I do\nbelieve that we cannot impose sanctions against Chinese entities on a\nconstant basis and expect to avoid repercussions that can affect our\nbroader interests. But, this is as much an argument for not imposing\nsanctions in those other areas as it is for denying the development of\nsanctions tools to deal with fentanyl; indeed, I could suggest a few\nsanctions choices made by this Administration that I would suggest that\nthey reconsider if needed to provide space for fentanyl-related\nmeasures.\nSanctions Overuse\nBeyond China specifically, there is a broader issue about whether\nthe United States is overusing the tool of sanctions more generally. I\nhave been outspoken in my concern that we are turning the U.S. economy\ninto an increasingly difficult operating environment given the\ncomplexity of U.S. compliance demands and the ever-changing nature of\nour sanctions policies. A quick count of U.S. sanctions programs\navailable of OFAC's website underscores how many different sanctions\nregimes exist--30 \\10\\--and this does not include programs administered\nby the State or Commerce Departments, much less the requirements of\nU.S. export controls. As I wrote with former Secretary Jack Lew in\nForeign Affairs last year, the United States is not in imminent danger\nof losing its economic primacy or becoming too difficult to do business\nwith, but the over-use of sanctions can contribute to the development\nof mechanisms that avoid the United States and its rules to the extent\npossible. \\11\\ That is not good for the U.S. economy or the power of\nU.S. sanctions.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\10\\ https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/\nPages/Programs.aspx\n\\11\\ https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2018-10-15/use-\nand-misuse-economic-statecraft?cid=soc-tw-rdr\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMoreover, this is no mere theory: in the case of Iran sanctions, we\nare seeing today a concerted attempt by U.S. allies in Europe to deal\nwith U.S. sanctions they oppose by setting up structures that seek to\navoid conventional banking methods and thereby dilute the impact of\nU.S. secondary sanctions. Regardless of how one feels about this\ndevelopment (or its likely efficacy), this is a problem if institutions\neventually develop that have this as their central mission. The value\nof U.S. sanctions--particularly those involving financial means--is\nthat it is too hard to avoid U.S. institutions and too profitable to\nuse them. This is not a static situation and commercial decisions could\nbe different if the cost/benefit equation were to shift. If other\noptions exist, then--in time--U.S. sanctions will lose their potency.\nIt is not in our interest for such instruments to exist or to get\npractice in operations.\nNotwithstanding this point, the sanctions outlined in the FSA are\nunlikely to serve as the trigger for construction of such mechanisms.\nAs an abstract matter, the FSA will contribute to an unhelpful\ntrendline by being yet another complication for companies operating in\nthe United States and with potentially targeted firms. But, the\ndiscrete nature of the sanctions envisioned and, importantly, the\ndesire to avoid their use by instead prioritizing diplomatic efforts\nwith China (and others) can help to minimize this danger. There are\nsanctions regimes currently in place that will likely prove far more\nconsequential in steering foreign behavior with respect to sanctions\nover-use concerns, not least being U.S. sanctions against Iran. That\nsaid, the broader issue merits study and examination, especially by the\nU.S. Congress. I understand there are proposals under consideration by\nvarious members and committees on Capitol Hill that would examine U.S.\nsanctions policy writ large and encourage assessment of sanctions' use,\nmisuse, overuse, and best practices. In my opinion, these proposals\nhave considerable merit.\nConclusion\nAltogether, though I believe that there are legitimate questions of\nboth efficacy and broader policy focus surrounding the FSA, I believe\nthat it is a reasonable next step to take in our efforts to redress our\nconcerns regarding the supply of fentanyl to this country. The\nsanctions proposed are proportional, reasonable, subject to executive\ndiscretion, consistent with a diplomatic approach, and manageable in\nthe overall policy context. In an ideal world, no sanctions measures\nincluded in the FSA would ever need to be used, as their mere existence\nwould contribute momentum to ongoing diplomatic efforts to confront the\nchallenge of illicit fentanyl trade. Even if sanctions had to be\nimposed, I believe there are mechanisms in the FSA to manage their\ndeleterious impacts as well as to provide relief in the context of\nfuture diplomatic progress. There are some modest changes to the text\nthat would be advisable--specifically, with respect to an explicit\ntermination clause as well as expanding the scope of ``cooperating\ncountry'' waivers to cover companies--but as written, these issues can\nbe accommodated regardless.\nI appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today and to offer\nmy testimony. I look forward to your questions. Thank you.\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SASSE\nFROM KEVIN WOLF\nQ.1. The U.S. Government has primarily relied on the Kingpin\nAct to combat international drug trafficking but this\nlegislation is over 19 years old. In your opinion how has the\ntrafficking business--whether it's fentanyl, heroine, other\nhard drugs, or human trafficking--evolved in the last 19 years\nand have our authorities been able to keep up with how these\nnetworks operate in practice?\nA.1. I am not an expert in such topics, \\1\\ so I will not\nrespond because it would not be of use to the Senator. From\nwhat I learned during the hearing, however, I applaud the\nSenator's and the Committee's efforts to address aggressively\nthe topic. There seems to be bipartisan consensus on spending\nthe time and resources necessary to address the serious issue.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/\nWolf%20Testimony%206-4-19.pdf\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR MORAN\nFROM KEVIN WOLF\nQ.1. This Committee shepherded the passage the Export Control\nReform Act (ECRA), which enjoyed a strong bipartisan consensus\ndue to its careful approach toward pursuing important U.S.\nnational security objectives while preserving U.S. leadership\nin technological innovation. The Commerce Department is now\nleading implementation of export control reforms for emerging\nand foundational technologies called for in the legislation.\nWhat steps does the Commerce Department need to take in order\nto ensure that new export controls do not undermine the ability\nof U.S. companies to innovate and compete on at the frontiers\nof technology?\nA.1. First, I agree with the characterization of ECRA and its\nstatus. Second, my thoughts on the steps needed to fully\nimplement the new law are set out in detail in my prepared\nremarks. \\1\\ From the testimony, the following is a summary of\nmy suggested steps to respond to your question:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/\nWolf%20Testimony%206-4-19.pdf\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Committee and HFAC need to engage in regular and\nsignificant oversight of BIS and the other export control\nagencies to ensure that ECRA is implemented faithfully and any\nnew controls are consistent with the requirements and standards\nin ECRA. In particular, this Committee and HFAC should ensure\nthat BIS:\na.  Reaches out to all available Government, industry, and\nacademic resources for information as part of its\ntechnology identification effort;\nb.  Publishes new controls as proposed rules to get industry\ninput on their clarity and ECRA consistency before\nimposing them as final, except in truly emergency\nsituations;\nc.  Not propose unilateral controls on technologies that are\nwidely available outside the United States;\nd.  Solicit and take seriously industry input on whether any\nproposed new unilateral controls would harm domestic\nresearch into affected technologies;\ne.  Confirm that any new controls would actually stem their\nflow to China and other countries of concern (rather\nthan merely harming U.S. companies to the benefit of\ntheir foreign competition);\nf.  Justify why the technology proposed to be controlled is\n``essential'' to U.S. national security;\ng.  Identify what the specific weapons-, military-, or\nintelligence-related application the control is\ndesigned to address that is not now being addressed by\na control;\nh.  Explain the results of BIS's full consideration of the\nimpact on the U.S. economy that would result from the\nunilateral control and BIS's responses to industry\nviews on the question; and\ni.  Explain why any new proposed control is of a type that\nwould be accepted by the multilateral export control\nregimes (or why a unilateral control would be justified\nand effective).\nThe Committee and HFAC should ensure that ECRA does not\nbecome a tool of trade policy and the economic impact of any\nproposed new controls is fully studied based on Government and\naffected industry data. Indeed, ECRA section 4811(1) states\nthat the United States should ``use export controls only after\nfull consideration of the impact on the economy of the United\nStates and only to the extent necessary--(A) to restrict the\nexport of items which would make a significant contribution to\nthe military potential of any other country or combination of\ncountries which would prove detrimental to the national\nsecurity of the United States; and (B) to restrict the export\nof items if necessary to further significantly the foreign\npolicy of the United States or to fulfill its declared\ninternational obligations.''\nThe Committee and HFAC should ensure that any new controls\nare as multilateral as possible given that ECRA section 4811(5)\nstates that ``[e]xport controls should be coordinated with the\nmultilateral export control regimes. Export controls that are\nmultilateral are most effective, and should be tailored to\nfocus on those core technologies and other items that are\ncapable of being used to pose a serious national security\nthreat to the United States and its allies.''\nThe Committee and HFAC should be open to BIS's addressing\nconcerns regarding China and other countries through controls\non specific end uses and end users rather than only through\nlists of controlled technologies.\nBecause perception can become reality with respect to\neconomic decisions involving U.S. companies, the Committee and\nHFAC should ensure that BIS describe its plans for new China-\nspecific controls publicly with clarity, certainty, and with as\nmuch ECRA-consistent emphasis on multilateral solutions as\npossible. This is vital to reducing uncertainty, and thus\nunnecessarily lost business opportunities for U.S. companies\ninvolving benign items, among those who do not follow the\nnuances of the EAR, ECRA, and the regulatory process.\nThis Committee and HFAC should do what they can to provide\nthe Bureau of Industry and Security and the other export\ncontrol agencies substantially more financial and other support\nfor it to do its work. As described in my testimony, the issues\nare far more complex than they ever have been and more people\nare needed to fully implement ECRA.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF\nSENATOR MENENDEZ FROM KEVIN WOLF\nQ.1. One of the provisions that I authored in FIRRMA requires\nCFIUS to develop regulations to ensure that State-owned\nentities are declaring their transactions with CFIUS and not\nusing complex financial structures to conceal their ownership\nor evade CFIUS review. We saw this situation at work in\nDecember, when the Wall Street Journal reported that a firm\nowned by China's Ministry of Finance was able to use offshore\nsubsidiaries to purchase a U.S. satellite firm and was thereby\nallegedly able to access information that may be restricted\nunder U.S. export controls.\nWhat is your assessment of CFIUS's ability to evaluate the\nextent of foreign Government control or influence over foreign\nfirms seeking to invest in the U.S.?\nA.1. They are good. The relevant regulations impose significant\ndisclosure requirements regarding direct and indirect owners of\nthe parties to the transactions. CFIUS staff routinely go back\nto the parties to ask for more such information and detail.\nMore importantly, from my experience on CFIUS, the Intelligence\nCommunity performs a robust review of the parties to the\ntransaction in order to spot red flags regarding other parties\nthat might have the ability to influence the activities of the\ntarget U.S. business contrary to national security interests.\nIn my 7 years as a representative to CFIUS, I do not believe\nthat we lacked sufficient information in reviewing a\ntransaction to determine whether there was an unresolved\nnational security concern associated with an indirect owner.\nThe real issue, in my view, is resources, particularly\nsince such issues are becoming far more complicated. The\nstatute and the regulations are sufficient to require the\ncollection and review of such information. Although I have been\nout of Government for over 2 years, my sense is that, with the\nchange in investment strategies that have been much discussed,\nthere needs to be more CFIUS staff dedicated to researching and\nreviewing complex ownership structures of notified and non-\nnotified transactions. My sense is that the Intelligence\nCommunity risk assessments could be improved with more IC\nanalysts--particularly those who are fluent in Chinese--to\nreview SIGINT and public information to provide even more\nrefined assessments of when indirect ownership or controls\ncould create concerns.\nWith respect to the satellite-specific aspect of the\nquestion, I refer the Senator and his staff to Senator Bennet's\namendment to the NDAA that is now section 6207 (Report on\nExport of Certain Satellites to Entities With Certain\nBeneficial Ownership Structures) of S. 1790. I believe that it\nwould address many of the issues motivating the question. I\npersonally would endorse the addition of resource (as suggested\nin section 6207(c)(6)) to the Bureau of Industry and Security\nso that it can better study such ownership issues during the\nlicense application process.\nWith respect to other space-related technology transfer\nissues pertaining to China, please see my testimony at: https:/\n/www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Kevin%20Wolf%20USCC%2025\n%20April.pdf.\nQ.2. Are there additional disclosure requirements--on\nbeneficial ownership, for example--that are necessary for\nChinese entities that want to invest in the U.S. or access our\nfinancial markets?\nA.2. I am not an expert \\1\\ on the existing disclosure\nrequirements with respect to access to financial markets, so I\nwill pass on responding to this question in detail. From the\ncongressional commentary and media coverage, however, it\nappears to clearly be an area worthy of study. I agree with the\ngeneral theme from the hearing that the U.S. financial system\nshould not have built-in incentives for U.S. investors--\ndeliberately or subconsciously--to make decisions or take\nactions that would be in their financial interests but would\nsimultaneously be contrary to our national security interests.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/\nWolf%20Testimony%206-4-19.pdf\nQ.3. More broadly, how should we think about how to best\ncompete with Chinese State-owned enterprises that often make\ndecisions based on strategic or political considerations as\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nopposed to market forces?\nA.3. At the macro and extremely general level, we do not want\nto move in the direction of becoming a State-planned economy\noutside the global dispute resolution systems similar to the\nChinese economy in order to compete with China. I understand\nthe temptation to do so because it is difficult to fight unfair\ntrade and economic behavior with principled and fair economic\nbehavior. Although I am not an economist, my instincts and\nexperience tell me that the way for the United States to\nprevail economically is to not try to pick winners and losers\nin the U.S. economy, particularly through protectionist\nmeasures that are inconsistent with the world trading system\nthat the U.S. helped build after World War II and that has, in\nthe main, served us and the world well ever since. This system\nalready contains a suite of well-tested tools, such as those\ndesigned to address dumping, State-subsidies, and intellectual\nproperty theft. Of course, none is perfect, but working within\nthe existing system is better than the alternative.\nOne of the Government's other roles in responding to this\nissue is to support in every way possible domestic innovation,\nfundamental research, and creativity in an open, low regulatory\nburden capitalist economy so that U.S. companies and research\ninstitutions have the opportunity to out-innovate their foreign\ncompetition, particularly in high-value services and technology\nsectors that are needed to support and drive much of the rest\nof the economy.\nAnother of the Government's roles in this topic must be to\nwork with our allies, each of which face similar issues with\nrespect to China. No one country's actions alone can respond to\nthe Chinese policies and practices that are motivating the\nquestion. For example, if the U.S. and most of the non-China\nPacific Nations were to align together in a trade partnership\nto reduce barriers to trade among such countries, they could\nact collectively to respond to unfair Chinese trade practices\nfar more effectively--while at the same time benefiting U.S.\ncompanies and advancing U.S. environmental and labor standards.\n(This is why I believe the U.S. withdrawal from even a TPP--\nmodified to address various labor, human rights, and\nenvironmental issues--was a mistake on a variety of levels.)\nAt the individual transaction level, one of CFIUS's\nimportant roles is to evaluate foreign direct investments to\nensure that there is a legitimate economic reason for the\ninvestment. If the investment is (or appears to be) motivated\nfor foreign policy reasons of a foreign country (rather than\nexpected economic gain for the parties), then CFIUS should\naggressively mitigate the transaction or recommend a block.\nFrom my experience on CFIUS, we would periodically see\ntransactions that were ``too good to be true,'' suggesting that\nthere was another motive. This is why I was pleased to see the\nadditional authority FIRRMA gave to CFIUS to require mandatory\nfilings of investments by foreign Governments or by those for\nwhich a foreign Government had a substantial interest. I look\nforward to reading (and potentially commenting on) the proposed\nimplementing regulations CFIUS will publish this fall to\naddresses the concern motivating the question.\nOn the technology transfer side, the export control rules\nand interagency review process are designed to identify\nproposed exports that may be motivated for reasons that are not\nexclusively economic in their motivation. That is, if based on\nthe license application and the follow-on questions, it appears\nthat the proposed export to China would not be in connection\nwith a purely civil end use and end user that was motivated by\neconomic considerations, then Commerce has denied and should\ncontinue denying such applications.\nQ.4. Are there particular sectors of regions, like Latin\nAmerica, where we need to be smarter and more agile in\nresponding to and getting ahead of this challenge?\nA.4. The Intelligence Community is the one to answer such\nquestions. In my experience in Government, however, the primary\nsource of investments (or proposed exports) that did not appear\nto be based on clearly economic motives was China. Most such\ntransactions were motivated for financial reasons, but there\nwere certainly cases where there was an apparent Chinese\nforeign policy or other noneconomic motive behind the\ninvestment.\nQ.5. What is your assessment of the risk posed by the current\ntreatment of Hong Kong as a separate and favorable customs\nentity for the export of dual-use and other sensitive U.S.\ntechnologies which can then be reexported to the PRC? Given the\ncontinued erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy and Beijing's ever-\ngreater control, has the time come to treat Hong Kong and the\nmainland the same for purposes of these sensitive technology\nexports under U.S. law?\nA.5. I do not know. The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of\n1992 effectively requires the U.S. Government to treat Hong\nKong and mainland China as two separate destinations for export\ncontrol purposes. In addition, section 103(8) of the Act states\nthat the ``United States should continue to support access by\nHong Kong to sensitive technologies controlled under [the then\nexisting multilateral export control regime that is the\npredecessor to the Wassenaar Arrangement] for so long as the\nUnited States is satisfied that such technologies are protected\nfrom improper use or export.'' Because the United States has\nnot made a determination to the contrary, the statutory and\nregulatory prohibitions pertaining to the export and reexport\nof space-related (and other controlled) items subject to U.S.\njurisdiction that are applicable to mainland China do not apply\nif the destination is Hong Kong. The export control\nregulations, however, still require licenses to export and\nreexport space-related and other controlled items to Hong Kong.\nApplications for such exports and reexports are reviewed by\nU.S. Government export control authorities to determine, for\nexample, whether Hong Kong is indeed the ultimate destination\nand whether the export or reexport otherwise presents any\nnational security or foreign policy concerns.\nBefore the hearing, I was asked to comment on whether\nitems, particularly space-related items, subject to U.S. export\ncontrols are being illegally exported out of Hong Kong to China\nor other countries of concern. I left the Government on January\n20, 2017, and thus no longer have access to such information,\nwhether positive or negative. I can, however, say that on\nJanuary 19, 2017, a rule that I signed expressing concerns\nabout the issue remains in effect. The rule imposes additional\nsupport document requirements on exports and reexports to Hong\nKong. In essence, the rule leveraged the EAR to effectively\ncompel compliance with Hong Kong export and import permit\nrequirements by requiring proof of compliance with Hong Kong\nlaw as a support document necessary for shipping under an EAR\nlicense or license exception. As stated in the preamble, BIS\ntook ``this action to provide greater assurance that U.S.-\norigin items that are subject to multilateral control regimes .\n. . will be properly authorized by the United States to the\nfinal destination [such as Mainland China], even when those\nitems first pass through Hong Kong.'' My thought at the time\nwas that if we had regular, robust assurances and intelligence\nthat diversions of U.S.-origin items were not occurring, then\nthe additional requirements would remain in effect as is or be\nremoved. If not, then the stricter licensing policies,\nincluding policies of presumptive denials, would need to be\nimposed. I would encourage you to ask this question of current\nBIS officials. In addition, I would encourage you to ask\ncurrent BIS officials whether there is an advantage in treating\nHong Kong differently, notwithstanding the issues referenced in\nthe question, because it allows for more access to information\nand cooperation on nonproliferation objectives than would\notherwise be the case.\nQ.6. I was shocked when the Administration rolled back\npenalties for ZTE last year in the rush to get a trade deal.\nAnd I'm still concerned with the President's recent comments\nsuggesting that loosening restrictions on Huawei could again be\npart of some transactional give-and-take in the broader trade\ndispute. Do you believe the Administration's approach with\nrespect to ZTE and Huawei will achieve our goals of protecting\nour national security and communications infrastructure?\nA.6. As the former Assistant Secretary who was responsible for\nthe use of the Entity List for 7 years and who also was the one\nwho helped shepherd the interagency effort to add ZTE to the\nEntity List, I have thought a lot about this question and the\nproper use of the list. It is a valuable tool for advancing our\nnational security and foreign policy interests, but it must be\nused carefully in order to not provoke responses that are more\nharmful than helpful to the same interests. Putting all my\nthoughts on the topic in writing would be a significant effort,\nhowever. One day I will. In the meantime, Members of the\nCommittee or any of its staff should feel free to call me to\ncome up to the Hill discuss the topic. Without advocating for\nor against any particular listing, I would be happy to discuss\nwhat the tool is and is not, its history, its effect, and how I\nthink it should best be used. \\2\\ As part of the Committee's\noversight responsibilities, it should have such background\ngiven the prominence the Entity List is taking in export\ncontrol, law enforcement, and bilateral activities. A lot of\nnuance and detail is lost in the current discussions, which is\nunderstandable because it has historically been a rather\nesoteric tool known generally only to trade practitioners and\nthose affected by a listing.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\2\\ Eric Hirschhorn, my former boss and the former Under Secretary\nfor Industry and Security has also thought a lot about such issues and\nI would encourage the Committee to reach out to him as well.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor example, the President's ZTE-related tweet was actually\nwith respect to a Denial Order imposed after I left Government\nservice rather than the Entity List action I was involved in.\nThe two tools are substantially similar (and limited only to\nthe export, reexport, or transfer of items ``subject to the\nExport Administration Regulations''), but a denial order is the\nresult of a civil or a criminal enforcement settlement. The\nEntity List tool is generally used before a civil or criminal\ninvestigation and, as was the case with ZTE, can be useful as\nleverage in addressing the national security or foreign policy\nconcerns that would later be addressed through law enforcement\nefforts.\nIn any event, I agree with the premise of the question,\nwhich is that the Entity List should never be used as a tool of\ntrade policy or as a negotiating chip for anything other than\nachieving actual national security (as opposed to economic or\npolitical) or foreign policy objectives. It devalues both and\ncould lead to the tool's becoming less effective if foreign\ncompanies and Governments see it, in reality or perception, as\na transactional or political tool to be negotiated against on\nissues unrelated to the bad acts that caused the foreign entity\nto be added to the list. Successive Administrations have\nforcefully (and truthfully) emphasized to foreign Governments\nand foreign companies that U.S. export controls in general, and\nthe Entity List in particular, were not used for political or\neconomic purposes. (Indeed, this is why we published ZTE's\ninternal documents describing its plans to violate U.S. law\nwhen we added ZTE to the Entity List in March 2016. We wanted\nthe company and the Chinese Government to see that our actions\nwere motivated exclusively by national security and law\nenforcement concerns, rather than political objectives.)\nWith respect to the Huawei matter, it is hard for me to\nanswer the question because neither I nor anyone I know knows\n(or can say) what the Administration's objective is with\nrespect to the listing. That is part of the problem. I've read\nthe transcript of the President's press conference, heard the\nspeeches by Commerce officials, and have read the press reports\nof the topic. From the outside, I cannot tell whether (i) the\nAdministration plans to forever list Huawei as part of an\neffort to significantly harm the company financially for\nbroader ``disentangling'' objectives, (ii) trade away the\nlisting for more agricultural purchases from China, (iii) focus\nthe effort on Huawei's 5G capabilities, or (iv) remove Huawei\nfrom the list once it can confirm that it is no longer engaged\nin the sanctions-related activities the notice stated was the\nbasis for the listing. Given that I am no longer in the\nGovernment and know that most information on such issues cannot\nbe made public, I am willing to give the Administration the\nbenefit of the doubt that there is a plan that will achieve its\nnational security objectives without unnecessarily harming U.S.\nindustry, such as through the issuance of some types of\nlicenses. By the way, the issues involving the Huawei are\nindeed extremely serious and I am not in any way challenging\nthe Administration's desire to take action against it. Rather,\nI am merely puzzled by the process to achieve the goal.\nEven if, however, there is a clear, interagency-cleared and\nagreed-upon plan on how to handle the matter, the perception of\nunrelated Chinese companies, based on their comments to the\nU.S. companies I work with, is that the Entity List has become\na political and a trade policy tool. This view, whether\njustified or not, and the resulting general uncertainty are\nmotivating Chinese buyers of benign, commercial U.S.-origin\nitems to begin dual-sourcing with non-U.S. alternate suppliers\nor moving away from U.S. sellers completely. This, of course,\nharms U.S. companies economically, helps their foreign\ncompetition, and has no impact on the Chinese economy. Without\nthe income from sales of benign commercial items to Huawei and\nother Chinese companies, U.S. companies have less to invest in\nR&D, which reduces their ability to advance their technologies\nto stay competitive. This ultimately harms the U.S. defense\nindustrial base and our national security because the Defense\nDepartment depends upon advances in the commercial technologies\ngenerated by such R&D to be able to acquire more advanced\nitems, particularly in the microelectronics sector, and at low\nper-unit costs.\nTo avoid such responses or beliefs from developing when I\nwas the Assistant Secretary, I tried to ensure that the\naddition of an entity to the list was a means to an end rather\nthan an end in itself. Being added to the list is not imposing\ndenial order. It is not settling a civil or a criminal\nenforcement action. It is not a sanction imposed by the\nTreasury Department, which is much broader in scope than the\nEntity List prohibitions. Rather, the addition uses the EAR's\nleverage over exports, reexports, and transfers of items\nsubject to the regulations to motivate foreign parties to stop\nengaging in the acts contrary to foreign policy and national\nsecurity interests that led to the listing. Historically, once\n(and if) the listed foreign party could confirm with confidence\nthat it has stopped engaging in the bad act that led to the\nlisting, then BIS would remove it from the list. If it could\nnot, then it would stay on the list. Without such a possibility\nbeing understood, then its effectiveness as a tool of leverage\nis lost.\nFinally, the Entity List tool is, as is the whole EAR,\nfocused on the export, reexport, and transfer of commodities,\nsoftware, and technology ``subject to the Export Administration\nRegulations.'' Such items are primarily U.S.-origin items and\nall items that are in the United States. A small number of\nforeign-made items outside the United States are ``subject to\nthe EAR'' if they contain specific amounts of U.S.-origin\ncontent controlled for national security reasons. (The exact\nrule is more complicated and can be found in EAR Part 734.)\nContrary to many media reports, the list does not prohibit U.S.\ncompanies from shipping to listed entities from outside the\nUnited States foreign-made items that are not subject to the\nEAR. Unlike Treasury's sanctions (which are vastly broader in\nscope), the EAR's Entity List prohibitions are not based on the\nnationality or ownership of the shipper, only the nature of the\nunderlying item being shipped. My point in listing these\ndifferences is that such limitations should be understood\nbefore deciding to use the list to take action against a\nforeign company. That is, if the entity does not need a\nsignificant amount of U.S.-origin items, for example, to\nfunction, then the listing will not be that effective and other\nregulatory tools need to be considered.\nAnother implication of the Entity List's structure is that\nit is not a tool that can be used to control the import into\nthe United States of Chinese-made or equipment into the United\nStates, such as with respect to that which would be used in the\n5G infrastructure. President Trump has recently issued a supply\nchain-related Executive Order that requires BIS to publish\nregulations implementing inbound and other transaction controls\nrelated to information and communications technology. \\3\\ I\nunderstand that BIS will be publishing regulations on this\ntopic this summer or fall. This Committee will want to study\nsuch regulations to see how well or not they address some of\nthe concerns implicit in the question.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\3\\ https://www.akingump.com/en/news-insights/international-trade-\nalert-executive-order-and-huawei-entity.html\nQ.7. I have made the point to the Administration that if we are\ngoing to compete with Huawei on 5G architecture it's not enough\nto confront China on predatory economic practices or security\nrisk--both of which are real--but that we must also be at the\nforefront of constructing public-private partnerships, with our\nallies and partners, to assure that there is an alternative\narchitecture--economically viable, secure, and with appropriate\nprivacy safeguards. What is your assessment of this sort of\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\napproach?\nA.7. Absolutely. As mentioned above, multilateral cooperation\nwith common objectives with respect to China is vital to the\nsuccess of any such plan. Industry must be involved in the\nsolution. And the imposition of export controls, sanctions, and\ntariffs can only be one part of what must be a broader whole-\nof-Government effort to address the issues in the question. Let\nme know how I can help.\nQ.8. Are there particular sectors--AI, machine learning,\ngenomics, biometrics, quantum computing--where you see\nparticular U.S. vulnerabilities? How do we best safeguard our\nedge in those areas?\nA.8. The regulations are already quite broad and capture any\ntype of commodity of any sensitivity and all stages of its\ndevelopment that is in any way specially designed for military\napplications, and the technologies and software related to\nthem. There also has been a robust interagency and\ninternational process for decades to identify commercial items\nthat have proliferation-related or significant military\napplications. Thus, I do not know the delta between what is not\nnow controlled and what should be. I do, however, have complete\nconfidence in the process and standards for what should be\ncontrolled that are set out in the Export Control Reform Act.\nMy prepared remarks set out the standards and my views on the\ntopic in detail. \\4\\ The technologies in the question are all\ncertainly worthy of study to see if there are subsets of such\ntechnologies that meet the ECRA standards for control. From the\noutside, it appears as if the Administration has a regular\norder process for analyzing such questions. This Committee\nshould follow that process closely to ensure that it and any\namendments to the EAR that result are consistent with the\nstandards of ECRA.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\4\\ https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/\nWolf%20Testimony%206-4-19.pdf\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIdentifying emerging and foundational technologies to be\nadded to control lists is only one part of what is needed to\nkeep our edge, as noted in the question. The agencies that\nadminister and study such technologies need significantly more\nresources in order to properly conduct an ever-more complicated\ntask. The enforcement agencies need more resources to\ninvestigate and prosecute violations, which motivates more\ninternal compliance. The agencies need more resources to\nconduct outreach and training so that companies can be on the\nfront line of compliance.\nThe other key to keeping the edge is that list-based\ncontrols cannot do it alone. There are many other types of\nGovernment support that are needed. Funding for fundamental\nresearch, for example, is critical to maintaining the edge.\nKeeping open markets with allies and others for less sensitive\ntechnologies in a low regulatory burden environment is also key\nfor the companies that develop such technologies. I'm not an\nexpert in all the other ways to help. I just want to note that\nexport controls are only a part of the solution to the issue\nidentified in the question.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR WARREN\nFROM KEVIN WOLF\nQ.1. What steps should the United States be taking, that it is\ncurrently not taking, to counter the influence of China's Belt\nand Road Initiative (BRI) in countries that have a demand for\ninfrastructure and other public projects, so that those\ncountries have a viable alternative to surrendering their\nstrategic infrastructure to China?\nA.1. I am an expert in the law, policy, practice, and\nadministration of export and foreign direct investment controls\nto achieve national security and foreign policy objectives. \\1\\\nI am only an amateur in topics involving the best way to\nrespond to the BRI issues.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/\nWolf%20Testimony%206-4-19.pdf\nQ.2. Does the successful penetration of China's Belt and Road\nInitiative (BRI) into economies in Europe, Latin America, and\nAfrica increase the likelihood that authoritarianism and\ncorruption will corrode the political systems of countries in\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nthose parts of the world? Please give a brief assessment.\nA.2. Again, I'm not an expert in such areas, but my general\nsense of the issue is that the answer to your question is\nclearly ``yes.''\nQ.3. Aside from using tariffs, sanctions, export controls, and\nother tools of economic statecraft to punish China for\nanticompetitive and coercive economic practices, what domestic\npolicy tools should the United States be using to strengthen\nour competitiveness and reduce wealth inequality here at home--\nregarding basic and applied research, public education,\ninfrastructure, and other investments?\nA.3. Again, I'm not an expert outside the export control and\nforeign direct investment areas, but I absolutely agree with\nthe essence of the question, which is that tariffs, sanctions,\nand export controls are not the solution to all the problems\nbefore us, particularly those involving China. It is relatively\neasy to sanction a company, impose a control over a technology,\nor impose a tariff. It is, however, relatively hard to help\nU.S. companies, and their employees, ``run faster'' and stay\ninternationally competitive through the types of investments\nidentified in the question. A proper answer to the question\nwould essentially require the preparation of an entire economic\nagenda for an Administration. There are others far more\nqualified than me to set out such an agenda.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SINEMA\nFROM KEVIN WOLF\nQ.1. Many experts say a multilateral approach will ultimately\nbe needed to hold China accountable for its role in the\nproduction and distribution of illicit fentanyl. Do you share\nthat view?\nA.1. I am not an expert in such topics, \\1\\ so I will not\nrespond because it would not be of use to the Senator. From\nwhat I learned during the hearing, however, I applaud the\nSenator's and the Committee's efforts to address aggressively\nthe topic. There seems to be bipartisan consensus on spending\nthe time and resources necessary to address the serious issue.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/\nWolf%20Testimony%206-4-19.pdf\nQ.2. Do you feel that the Administration's policies and\nrhetoric on trade could undermine the necessary goodwill to\nwork collaboratively with our trading partners to hold China\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\naccountable and stop the flow of fentanyl?\nA.2. Again, although I am not an expert in the area, as\ndiscussed during the hearing in detail, solutions to such\nissues clearly require multilateral cooperation.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SASSE\nFROM SCOTT KENNEDY\nQ.1. The U.S. Government has primarily relied on the Kingpin\nAct to combat international drug trafficking but this\nlegislation is over 19 years old. In your opinion how has the\ntrafficking business--whether it's fentanyl, heroine, other\nhard drugs, or human trafficking--evolved in the last 19 years\nand have our authorities been able to keep up with how these\nnetworks operate in practice?\nIf not, where should improvements be considered?\nDo we have any good data driven evaluations of the\neffectiveness of the Kingpin Act and its utilization almost 20\nyears after enactment?\nAre there other related tools, perhaps the Transnational\nCriminal Organization (TCO) designation, that we could utilize\nin a more effective manner to combat these trafficking\nnetworks?\nFentanyl trafficking is particularly concerning because of\nits potency, addictiveness, and lethality but also because of\nits Chinese origin. Last year, the U.S. Government used the\nKingpin Act to designate Chinese fentanyl traffickers for\nsanctions. That action represents an evolution in utilization\nof the Act. How do you assess this development, especially\ngiven the large amount of fentanyl production in China from\npseudo-State entities?\nGiven the blurring of the lines between the Chinese\nCommunist Party and private sector entities in China, how would\nyou suggest we adjust our thinking and utilization of these and\nother sanctions authorities to combat fentanyl trafficking from\nChina?\nAre there any adjustments we need to be making to address\nfinancial flows related to fentanyl trafficking?\nIf so, what adjustments would you recommend?\nAre there any recommendations you would make that are\nunique to fentanyl trafficking as opposed to things we should\nbe doing to strengthen our anti- money-laundering (AML) regime?\nIf not, why not?\nA.1. I am not an expert on fentanyl, so cannot comment.\nQ.2. Some of our hearing touched on the implications 5, 10, 20\nyears down the road for U.S. preeminence in the international\nfinancial system. China and Russia have both developed an\nalternative to SWIFT and some in Europe have called for\nalternative payment systems that do not touch the United\nStates. How viable are these Chinese and Russian alternatives\nat the moment?\nA.2. In the short term, those Chinese and Russian alternatives\nare not viable.\nQ.3. How viable are they over the long run?\nA.3. In the long term, if the U.S. is perceived to exploit\nSWIFT for its own interests and therefore undercut SWIFT as an\nindependent platform for interbank transactions, that will\nincrease the incentive for Chinese and Russian alternatives.\nThe U.S. needs to reassure everyone that SWIFT is a public good\nthat serves global interests, not its own.\nQ.4. What are the metrics we should look at to evaluate whether\nthese alternative systems are becoming viable and could\npotentially displace U.S. preeminence?\nA.4. We should look at the number of financial institutions,\nthe number of transactions that go through the system, and\nother key financial institutions' media coverage that looks to\nother alternatives.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF\nSENATOR MENENDEZ FROM SCOTT KENNEDY\nQ.1. One of the provisions that I authored in FIRRMA requires\nCFIUS to develop regulations to ensure that State-owned\nentities are declaring their transactions with CFIUS and not\nusing complex financial structures to conceal their ownership\nor evade CFIUS review. We saw this situation at work in\nDecember, when the Wall Street Journal reported that a firm\nowned by China's Ministry of Finance was able to use offshore\nsubsidiaries to purchase a U.S. satellite firm and was thereby\nallegedly able to access information that may be restricted\nunder U.S. export controls.\nWhat is your assessment of CFIUS's ability to evaluate the\nextent of foreign Government control or influence over foreign\nfirms seeking to invest in the U.S.?\nA.1. Historically, CFIUS has done a good job in determining\nultimate control of company due to the fact that the number of\ncases have been low enough that the Members of the Committee\nhave been able to get information about the foreign acquirer.\nAdditionally, if CFIUS increases its examination of American\nsubsidiaries abroad, that will increase the challenge of\nunderstanding the true ownership of Chinese companies.\nQ.2. Are there additional disclosure requirements--on\nbeneficial ownership, for example--that are necessary for\nChinese entities that want to invest in the U.S. or access our\nfinancial markets?\nA.2. I do not know.\nQ.3. More broadly, how should we think about how to best\ncompete with Chinese State-owned enterprises that often make\ndecisions based on strategic or political considerations as\nopposed to market forces?\nA.3. Outside of China, American companies have been able to\nsuccessfully compete with Chinese SOEs in many industries. The\nmain challenge is sectors that have complex financing and\ninstitutions which provide financing for the customers. Chinese\nSOEs and large private companies receive export support by the\ninvolvement of the China Development Bank and China Export-\nImport Bank. The U.S. Export-Import Bank operates at a much\nsmaller scale, which puts U.S. firms at a disadvantage when it\ncomes to financing terms. In the Chinese market, the key is to\nlevel the playing field and open more sectors to foreign\ninvestment. One particularly helpful step would be to have\nChina join the WTO's Government Procurement Agreement; they\npledged to join the agreement as soon as possible after joining\nthe WTO, but 18 years later, they are still not signatories.\nQ.4. Are there particular sectors of regions, like Latin\nAmerica, where we need to be smarter and more agile in\nresponding to and getting ahead of this challenge?\nA.4. The U.S. needs global policies to monitor the activity of\nChinese SOEs, and increase cooperation in Latin America in\norder for them to understand the challenges of doing business\nwith Chinese SOEs and the political obligations and security\nrisks that come with it. The U.S. and the West also need to\nprovide good alternatives to this region in terms of proper\nfinancing options. The U.S. can actively take part in setting\ninternational norms in international development, foreign aid,\nand the development of multilateral institutions.\nQ.5. What is your assessment of the risk posed by the current\ntreatment of Hong Kong as a separate and favorable customs\nentity for the export of dual-use and other sensitive U.S.\ntechnologies which can then be reexported to the PRC? Given the\ncontinued erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy and Beijing's ever-\ngreater control, has the time come to treat Hong Kong and the\nmainland the same for purposes of these sensitive technology\nexports under U.S. law?\nA.5. For the time being, Hong Kong is being treated as separate\nfrom mainland China in terms of tariffs and export controls,\nbut the situation should be closely monitored. It would be\nhelpful for the U.S. Congress to hold public hearings on this\nsubject. Beijing should not take Hong Kong's external\ncommercial status for granted.\nQ.6. I was shocked when the Administration rolled back\npenalties for ZTE last year in the rush to get a trade deal.\nAnd I'm still concerned with the President's recent comments\nsuggesting that loosening restrictions on Huawei could again be\npart of some transactional give-and-take in the broader trade\ndispute. Do you believe the Administration's approach with\nrespect to ZTE and Huawei will achieve our goals of protecting\nour national security and communications infrastructure?\nA.6. No, the Administration's approach will not protect our\nnational security infrastructure. The biggest challenge from\nZTE and Huawei is whether having their equipment in U.S. and\nWestern networks increases national security vulnerabilities.\nThere is general consensus that this is the case for core parts\nof a country's network, but there is not consensus about\nwhether this applies beyond the core and with regard to\nhandsets. The Administration's May 2019 Executive Order\naddresses this risk, and the Administration is engaging with\nother Governments to come to decisions about Chinese telecom\nequipment.\nA separate issue is whether the operation of these\ncompanies themselves or their activities in non-Western\ncountries poses a threat to the United States. That is the\nlogic behind placing Huawei on the Commerce Department's\nEntities List in May 2019. There are potential multiple\nrationales for taking this action: it could slow Huawei's\ngrowth, reduce Huawei's progress in 5G, or even lead to the\ncompany's demise. It also could give the U.S. Government more\ninformation about what U.S. technology is being sold to the\ncompany (since companies have to receive approval for such\nsales). The Administration has yet to articulate which of these\nrationales undergirds its policy. This is made more confusing\nby the creation and extension of the Temporary General License,\nas well as the President's comments that U.S. could potentially\nremove Huawei from the Entities List if the U.S. and China\nreach a major trade deal. All of these complexities aside, my\nown view is that the Entities List action is not serving\nAmerican national security interests effectively, and that the\nU.S. can take a wide variety of other steps to respond to\nnational security challenges posed by any individual company.\nBeyond all of this, the U.S. needs to operate on the\nassumption that international telecommunication networks are\nnot 100 percent clean, and as a result, put primary energy on\nmitigating risks instead of decoupling from China entirely.\nQ.7. I have made the point to the Administration that if we are\ngoing to compete with Huawei on 5G architecture it's not enough\nto confront China on predatory economic practices or security\nrisk--both of which are real--but that we must also be at the\nforefront of constructing public-private partnerships, with our\nallies and partners, to assure that there is an alternative\narchitecture--economically viable, secure, and with appropriate\nprivacy safeguards. What is your assessment of this sort of\napproach?\nA.7. It is not reasonable to expect the U.S. and the West can\ncreate an entirely alternative architecture that does not\ninclude any Chinese participation. We do not have the\ntechnology, the funding or the companies for this. No private-\npublic partnership can fill this gap. Instead, global\narchitecture risks should be mitigated, which is a more cost-\neffective approach and addresses national security concerns.\nThe United States has been successful in the last 100 years\nnot only because it is powerful but because it is seen as a\nmore stable, mutually beneficial, and ultimately beneficent\npartner.\nIt remains in our interest to not only use our strength for\nour needs of the moment, but also to reinforce these views so\nthat we can harness these strengths in the long term. A long-\nterm approach that builds in the partnership of private sector\nentities and foreign Governments to create a stable, durable\narchitecture would be far more effective.\nQ.8. Are there particular sectors--AI, machine learning,\ngenomics, biometrics, quantum computing--where you see\nparticular U.S. vulnerabilities? How do we best safeguard our\nedge in those areas?\nA.8. There are areas in which the Chinese are doing well, some\nof which are beneficial to the U.S. and some of which are\nconcerning to the U.S., particularly in areas where\napplications serve Chinese military interests or surveillance\ntechnologies. The U.S. already has in place regulatory systems\nto monitor China and protect U.S. national security, but the\nU.S. needs to improve their technology and improve the market\nfor it, including commercialization, which would be the best\nway to protect itself.\nQ.9. In your testimony, you stated that ``the U.S. needs to\nstrengthen its own ecosystem for advanced technologies'' and\nthat ``a more successful American high-tech sector is the best\nbulwark against the challenge from China.'' I wholeheartedly\nshare those views and am working on legislation to address\nshortfalls in our own education, infrastructure, and research\nand development investments. What do you think are the most\nefficient ways for Congress to promote a vibrant high-tech\nsector and assure that the U.S. remains on the cutting-edge in\ndeveloping the technologies that will drive the next century?\nAre there specific programs or commercial incentives Congress\nshould look to create, change, or augment?\nA.9. There are a few ways Congress can promote a vibrant high-\ntech sector and assure that the U.S. remains on the cutting-\nedge in developing the technologies that will drive the next\ncentury. First, greater funding for basic research in science\nand technology. Second, a more targeted support for projects\nidentified by the Pentagon and the Department of Energy that\nare new emerging technologies and overseen by DARPA and ARPA-E.\nThird, greater funding for America's national science labs.\nFinally, the use of tax incentives to increase the demand for\nemerging technology by consumers in the private and Government\nsectors. For example, this should include greater rebates for\nNEVs in order to create a better market for them in the U.S.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR WARREN\nFROM SCOTT KENNEDY\nQ.1. What steps should the United States be taking, that it is\ncurrently not taking, to counter the influence of China's Belt\nand Road Initiative (BRI) in countries that have a demand for\ninfrastructure and other public projects, so that those\ncountries have a viable alternative to surrendering their\nstrategic infrastructure to China?\nA.1. The U.S. Government and private sector needs to provide\ngreater financial support for infrastructure-related projects\nfor developing countries. This shouldn't be viewed as corporate\nwelfare (as all of the funds are usually paid back to the U.S.\nTreasury, with interest), but rather as a way to promote\nAmerican export of goods and services and strengthen the\ndevelopment process of these countries.\nQ.2. Does the successful penetration of China's Belt and Road\nInitiative (BRI) into economies in Europe, Latin America, and\nAfrica increase the likelihood that authoritarianism and\ncorruption will corrode the political systems of countries in\nthose parts of the world? Please give a brief assessment.\nA.2. We should not worry about BRI's effect on the political\nsystems in those regions. The U.S. and the West need to\nincrease their activity in those regions, not only the Chinese.\nWe need to increase best practices in lending and in auditing\nprojects afterward. Also, promoting a healthy civil society in\nthese countries and increasing their knowledge about China is\nimportant so that those regions are able to independently make\njudgements on deals and Chinese motives.\nQ.3. Aside from using tariffs, sanctions, export controls, and\nother tools of economic statecraft to punish China for\nanticompetitive and coercive economic practices, what domestic\npolicy tools should the United States be using to strengthen\nour competitiveness and reduce wealth inequality here at home--\nregarding basic and applied research, public education,\ninfrastructure, and other investments?\nA.3. There are a few ways the U.S. can strengthen its\ncompetitiveness and reduce wealthy inequality. First, increase\nsupport for basic research. Second, develop tax and rebate\nincentives for the consumption of American technologies. Third,\nexamine the pros and cons of limiting intellectual property\nlicensing rates for technology that is clearly meant to serve\nas public goods. Fourth, increase the opportunities to advance\nSTEM education and employment opportunities for people from\nlower-income communities and minorities. There should be more\ndiversity amongst scientists. Fifth, increase the opportunities\nto study abroad and study a foreign language. With greater\ndiversity amongst scientists and engineers and the tech sector\ngenerally, it will more likely its benefits will be more widely\ndiffused across society.\nQ.4. Fentanyl--In Massachusetts, health providers, first\nresponders, and public officials have worked together in their\ncommunities in an effort to tackle the opioid crisis that has\naffected families across my State. While there are signs that\nmany of these efforts are having an impact in reducing the\nnumber of opioid overdose deaths, the illicit use of fentanyl,\nan extremely dangerous synthetic opioid, continues to fuel this\nepidemic. In 2018, for opioid-related overdose deaths in which\na toxicology screen was available, fentanyl was present in 89\npercent of them.\nThe State Department's most recent annual International\nNarcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) observes, ``In\nDecember 2018, China committed to control fentanyl compounds as\na class. Once implemented, this move should help thwart illicit\nchemists and manufacturers who quickly change their illicit\nformulations to nonregulated analogues to evade law\nenforcement.'' Has China's commitment produced this outcome?\nReferring to China, the State Department's INCSR observes,\n``U.S. law enforcement reports that the most common diversion\ntactic used by traffickers is the intentional mislabeling of\nshipments containing precursors. Perpetrators caught\nmislabeling precursor shipments often face only civil penalties\nand small fines rather than criminal charges. The challenge of\npreventing precursor diversion is further exacerbated by\nChina's ineffective enforcement of land, air, and sea transport\nregulations.'' Aside from revising its laws and regulations,\nworking with U.S. law enforcement partners and the Postal\nService, and cooperating with international regulatory efforts\nlike the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), what\nadditional steps should the Chinese Government be taking to\nensure that its relevant authorities are properly scheduling\nfentanyl analogues, tracking trends in the illicit fentanyl\nmarket, and holding traffickers and their affiliates\naccountable?\nDo you believe that Justice Department indictments of, and\nTreasury Department sanctions against, alleged Chinese fentanyl\nmanufacturers and distributors have a meaningful deterrent\neffect on Chinese fentanyl trafficking networks?\nA.4. I'm not an expert on fentanyl, so not able to comment.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF\nSENATOR CORTEZ MASTO FROM SCOTT KENNEDY\nQ.1. I have heard repeatedly from U.S. companies that are\nconcerned about forced technology transfer as a precondition\nfor doing business in China. The Chinese Government passed a\nnew Foreign Investment Law earlier this year, which the\nGovernment claims will address some of those issues.\nSince the passage of China's Foreign Investment Law earlier\nthis year, have you seen any indications that the Chinese\nGovernment may actually curtail forced technology transfer, and\nother tactics used to steal intellectual property?\nA.1. The Trump administration's 301 investigation, launched in\nAugust 2017, identified four ways in which the Chinese engaged\nin forced technology transfer. There has been mixed progress\nacross these areas:\n1.  Unreasonable licensing terms: Recent changes in China's\nregulations may modestly improve the situation in terms\nof licensing fees. Data from the U.S. Department of\nCommerce shows that China's payment of licensing fees\nhas increased over the last 2 years: https://www.csis-\ncips.org/news/2019/8/19/show-me-the-receipts.\n2.  Preconditions for technology sharing in exchange for\napproving American investment. China new Foreign\nInvestment Law bans this practice, but 20-25 percent of\nAmerican companies in China, according to an AmCham\nChina survey, say they still feel some sort of\npressure.\n3.  Chinese State-led investment abroad, with a focus on tech\nacquisition. Chinese outward investment has plummeted\nin the last 2 years, including in advanced technology.\nThis is a product of greater restrictions of outward\nflows of funds due to Chinese internal financial\nweakness and external barriers created by the U.S. and\nothers. China's financial situation will improve and\nmore funds will be permitted to be invested externally,\nbut recipients' walls are not likely to be lowered\nuntil there is greater strategic trust between China\nand others.\n4.  Cybertheft: Cybertheft by China apparently improved in\nthe period directly after the Xi-Obama meeting in\nSeptember 2015, but the latest reports show a return to\npre-agreement levels in cybertheft emanating from\nChina.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SINEMA\nFROM SCOTT KENNEDY\nQ.1. Many experts say a multilateral approach will ultimately\nbe needed to hold China accountable for its role in the\nproduction and distribution of illicit fentanyl. Do you share\nthat view?\nDo you feel that the Administration's policies and rhetoric\non trade could undermine the necessary goodwill to work\ncollaboratively with our trading partners to hold China\naccountable and stop the flow of fentanyl?\nA.1. I'm not an expert on fentanyl, so cannot comment.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SASSE\nFROM RICHARD NEPHEW\nQ.1. The U.S. Government has primarily relied on the Kingpin\nAct to combat international drug trafficking but this\nlegislation is over 19 years old. In your opinion how has the\ntrafficking business--whether it's fentanyl, heroine, other\nhard drugs, or human trafficking--evolved in the last 19 years\nand have our authorities been able to keep up with how these\nnetworks operate in practice?\nA.1. My field of expertise is in sanctions design, rather than\nin international narcotics trafficking. I would therefore\nsubmit that experts in narcotics trafficking would be better\npositioned to answer questions about how trafficking has\nevolved.\nFrom a purely sanctions design perspective, however, it is\nimportant to note that the increased use of chemical precursors\nand prescription medications as illicit drugs has broadened the\nscale of the problem and brought new potential suppliers into\nthe mix.\nNow, companies that make medicine or the chemicals that can\nbe used in it are potential contributors to the drug epidemic.\nGiven this, in my view, it is appropriate to expand the tools\navailable to the United States to respond, including via\nsanctions.\nThe Fentanyl Sanctions Act would give the United States\nsuch tools, including scalable penalties for those who engage\nin illicit fentanyl trafficking. The presence of such options\nis--in my view--helpful as the U.S. Government adopts a\nflexible, adaptive, and resourceful approach to preventing such\ntrafficking.\nQ.2. If not, where should improvements be considered?\nA.2. In my view, the passage of the Fentanyl Sanctions Act\nwould improve the U.S. ability to respond to incidents of\ntrafficking of synthetic opioids, which I understand represents\na serious new threat to the United States.\nQ.3. Do we have any good data driven evaluations of the\neffectiveness of the Kingpin Act and its utilization almost 20\nyears after enactment?\nA.3. I am not aware of any particular study of the Kingpin Act\nas a stand-alone piece of legislation. I do believe, though,\nthat as part of a multifaceted strategy for addressing\nnarcotics trafficking, it is useful to have sanctions tools,\njust as it is useful to have diplomatic, law enforcement,\ncustoms, and other tools to prevent trafficking.\nI am aware of a hearing on this subject in 2017 that\nincludes testimony that both acknowledges the value and the\ndeficiencies of the Kingpin Act. \\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ https://docs.house.gov/meetings/FA/FA07/20171108/106606/HHRG-\n115-FA07-Transcript-20171108.pdf\nQ.4. Are there other related tools, perhaps the Transnational\nCriminal Organization (TCO) designation, that we could utilize\nin a more effective manner to combat these trafficking\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nnetworks?\nA.4. A TCO designation could also be employed alongside a\nKingpin designation, though practically they would have the\nsame legal effect: both require an asset freeze and property\nblock on the designated individuals or entities.\nGiven this, a TCO designation would not provide any greater\nflexibility or utility than a Kingpin designation. For these\nreasons, I continue to believe that the tools provided by the\nFentanyl Sanctions Act merit consideration.\nQ.5. Fentanyl trafficking is particularly concerning because of\nits potency, addictiveness, and lethality but also because of\nits Chinese origin. Last year, the U.S. Government used the\nKingpin Act to designate Chinese fentanyl traffickers for\nsanctions. That action represents an evolution in utilization\nof the Act. How do you assess this development, especially\ngiven the large amount of fentanyl production in China from\npseudo-State entities?\nA.5. I believe that the designation of those particular\ntraffickers was merited on the basis of the information\nprovided by the Treasury Department.\nBut, the fact that the fentanyl problem continued after the\ndesignation suggests that other traffickers remain active in\nthe business and that either due to an absence of appropriate\nintelligence or concerns about the implications to otherwise\nlegitimate trade, the Treasury Department did not believe it\nhad grounds to impose further sanctions.\nGiven this, I believe that there remains utility in\nadopting new authorities that may improve the overall\neffectiveness of our sanctions component to the\ncountertrafficking strategy.\nI also believe that the Chinese authorities themselves have\ncommitted to addressing this problem. The Fentanyl Sanctions\nAct would contribute to these efforts by encouraging further\ndiplomatic work with China in this regard.\nQ.6. Given the blurring of the lines between the Chinese\nCommunist Party and private sector entities in China, how would\nyou suggest we adjust our thinking and utilization of these and\nother sanctions authorities to combat fentanyl trafficking from\nChina?\nA.6. I believe that the Chinese authorities are motivated at\npresent to address this problem, as has been demonstrated by\ntheir readiness to work with the United States on this matter\nnotwithstanding other bilateral problems.\nIt is vital that we continue to encourage Chinese\nGovernment improvement on this matter, especially by\nreinforcing that our intention is to address this problem with\nforeign Governments through diplomacy first.\nI believe that the most important next step that we should\ntake is to further incentivize Chinese cooperation with our\nefforts to prevent illicit fentanyl trafficking through the\npassage of the Fentanyl Sanctions Act. It has off-ramps for the\nimposition of sanctions that China can use and it incentivizes\ncooperation with international efforts to prevent this\ntrafficking.\nQ.7. Are there any adjustments we need to be making to address\nfinancial flows related to fentanyl trafficking?\nA.7. The most important element in addressing financial flows\nis to create disincentives for banks to look the other way for\ntransactions that are suspicious. Banks need to be motivated to\nensure their compliance programs are capable of identifying and\ndenying such transactions.\nQ.8. If so, what adjustments would you recommend?\nA.8. The creation of penalties and disincentives in the\nFentanyl Sanctions Act would be a good first step. In my\nexperience, most banks and other institutions are prepared to\ncooperate with enforcement efforts if they are shown what is\nrequired and given information to support these requirements.\nBut, for other institutions, they need to be motivated by\nthe risk of consequences if caught engaging in illicit conduct.\nIt is here that sanctions are useful but also structures to\navoid them, as provided in the Fentanyl Sanctions Act that\nwould allow for the waiver of penalties in circumstances where\nGovernments are addressing the problem.\nQ.9. Are there any recommendations you would make that are\nunique to fentanyl trafficking as opposed to things we should\nbe doing to strengthen our anti- money-laundering (AML) regime?\nA.9. I do not believe there are any unique solutions to the\nfinancial problem attached to fentanyl trafficking. The issue\nnow is helping banks identify transactions of concern and know\nhow to handle them when so identified.\nMore generally, programs for training in sanctions\ncompliance--for foreign Governments, foreign banks, and foreign\ncompanies--would be a welcome addition to the U.S. policy\ntoolkit in strengthening the AML/counter- illicit-finance\nregime internationally.\nQ.10. If not, why not?\nA.10. In my opinion, the fentanyl-related financial issues are\nless about fentanyl and more about the kinds of companies and\nentities that may be implicated. For this reason, it is more\nimportant--in my view--to strengthen the overall system than it\nis to specifically call out fentanyl.\nQ.11. Some of our hearing touched on the implications 5, 10, 20\nyears down the road for U.S. preeminence in the international\nfinancial system. China and Russia have both developed an\nalternative to SWIFT and some in Europe have called for\nalternative payment systems that do not touch the United\nStates. How viable are these Chinese and Russian alternatives\nat the moment?\nA.11. At this point, there are no viable alternatives to the\npayment systems that presently exist.\nQ.12. How viable are they over the long run?\nA.12. I believe that alternative systems are viable in the long\nrun.\nThese systems will not necessarily displace the role of the\nUnited States altogether. The United States remains a crucial\npart of the international financial system and the convenience\nand other advantages of operating in the United States will\nremain powerful for the foreseeable future.\nHowever, it is possible that there will be complementary\nsystems that will be usable by those who seek to avoid the\nU.S.-led financial system. The creation of such systems will be\na boon to U.S. adversaries and those who wish to evade U.S.\nsanctions enforcement.\nIt is worth noting, in this context, that the Shanghai\nCooperation Organization (SCO) issued a statement on 14 June\nthat said: ``Serious attention will be given to increasing the\nshare of national currencies in mutual financial transactions\nand settlements.'' \\2\\ This effectively means: ``bypass the\nU.S. dollar where possible.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\2\\ http://eng.sectsco.org/news/20190614/550955.html\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA major element in U.S. sanctions effectiveness is that the\nU.S. financial system remains too attractive to sidestep. It is\nprecisely this dynamic that is at risk in such a scenario.\nQ.13. What are the metrics we should look at to evaluate\nwhether these alternative systems are becoming viable and could\npotentially displace U.S. preeminence?\nA.13. I believe there are several metrics of merit, including:\n1.  Number of countries involved--obviously, the greater the\nnumber of jurisdictions involved, the greater the\nutility of an alternative\n2.  Size/value of the countries involved--numbers of\ncountries may not matter nearly as much as the scale of\ntheir economies. If a substantial part of international\nfinancial transactions can be facilitated via an\nalternative (e.g., 20 percent or greater), then the\nalternative system may be viable. Imagine, for example,\na system involving most of Africa, Latin America,\nChina, and Russia. Such a system may not be the same\nsize as the United States and European-dominated\nsystem, but it still will present opportunities and\nadvantages for the countries involved.\n3.  Number of financial institutions de-risking from the\nUnited States--the United States is at greatest risk\nwhere companies and banks refuse to conduct\ntransactions in the United States that have\ninternational components. Banks and companies that have\nsolely ``U.S. subsidiaries'' that are kept at a remove\nfrom other business operations would dramatically lower\nthe costs of sanctions imposition for violating U.S.\nsanctions rules.\n4.  Currency composition in trade--at present, the United\nStates is able to perform an invaluable service\ninternationally and profit from the use of the U.S.\ndollar as an intermediary currency. If you wish to\nconduct transactions between many countries in the\nworld, then you will likely convert currencies by using\nthe dollar (e.g., you will trade your pesos for dollars\nand then the dollars into francs in order to move goods\nfrom Mexico to Switzerland). If we see foreign\ncountries choosing to transact directly--despite the\ncosts and complexities--then this would suggest a\ndecision to avoid the United States, particularly if as\npart of an alternative system.\n5.  Invoicing/trading commodities outside of the U.S.\ndollar--as with the currency composition of trade, many\ncommodities are traded in dollars for ease of use and\nthe stability the dollar affords. Choosing to avoid the\ndollar would be an important part of a viable\nalternative system.\n6.  Speed/convenience of the alternative--a simple, but\nimportant, factor is the speed and convenience of an\nalternative system. If it becomes easy to use and with\nquick processing and clearing times, then an\nalternative system is viable.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF\nSENATOR MENENDEZ FROM RICHARD NEPHEW\nQ.1. One of the provisions that I authored in FIRRMA requires\nCFIUS to develop regulations to ensure that State-owned\nentities are declaring their transactions with CFIUS and not\nusing complex financial structures to conceal their ownership\nor evade CFIUS review. We saw this situation at work in\nDecember, when the Wall Street Journal reported that a firm\nowned by China's Ministry of Finance was able to use offshore\nsubsidiaries to purchase a U.S. satellite firm and was thereby\nallegedly able to access information that may be restricted\nunder U.S. export controls.\nWhat is your assessment of CFIUS's ability to evaluate the\nextent of foreign Government control or influence over foreign\nfirms seeking to invest in the U.S.?\nA.1. I believe that CFIUS has considerable ability to evaluate\nforeign Government control or influence over foreign firms\nseeking to invest in the United States.\nPrior to FIRRMA, however, CFIUS lacked the ability--in my\nopinion--to reject transactions where such suspicions were\nunproven or more amorphous. The issue was less one of\nevaluation and more legal mandate to act.\nI participated in CFIUS decisions while at the State\nDepartment and while confidentiality requirements prohibit me\nfrom discussing specific cases, there were several instances in\nwhich I believed that a transaction was inappropriate or\ndangerous, but was informed that the legal mandate that we had\nto reject investment decisions was so narrow as to preclude\ntaking action in those cases.\nThe changes introduced via FIRRMA should--in my view--avoid\nmany of these problems in the future.\nQ.2. Are there additional disclosure requirements--on\nbeneficial ownership, for example--that are necessary for\nChinese entities that want to invest in the U.S. or access our\nfinancial markets?\nA.2. Yes, I believe that additional disclosure requirements\n(such as beneficial ownership) would be useful in helping the\nUnited States to evaluate investment decisions.\nUltimately, though, disclosures are only as good as the\nExecutive Branch has the ability to evaluate their veracity and\nto act to deny investments or access to U.S. markets. For this\nreason, I also believe that additional investigatory\nresources--including intelligence gathering--would be useful.\nQ.3. More broadly, how should we think about how to best\ncompete with Chinese State-owned enterprises that often make\ndecisions based on strategic or political considerations as\nopposed to market forces?\nA.3. From my perspective, I believe there should be three\noverall elements of our approach:\nVigilance/awareness as to what Chinese State-owned\nenterprises are doing. We cannot prevent that of which\nwe are unaware and we do ourselves no favors by failing\nto look. This is a problem that exists beyond China. In\nour interest to pursue market opportunities, we\nsometimes lose sight of the competing interest\nperspectives that other countries have. We need to be\nfar more mindful of the different Government approaches\nthat exist and structure our domestic regulations and\nenforcement approaches to manage these competing\napproaches.\nPlay to our strengths. The United States is\nunlikely to ever approach economic decisions as China\ndoes. We do not structure our economy as the Chinese do\nnor is there any real interest in doing so.\nConsequently, direct competition with China on the same\nterms is both unlikely and ill-suited to our approach\nto economics. We do have considerable strengths,\nhowever, starting with the competitive nature of our\neconomy, its openness to external investment and\nadaptability. As we look to counter what China (and\nother countries) are doing, we need to ensure that we\ndo not stymie these forces unnecessarily. We should be\nstrategic in how we police investment and technology\ntransfer activities, maintaining our competitive edge\nalong the way.\nBuild coalitions. It remains unfortunate, in my\nview, that the Trump administration exited the Trans-\nPacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. For its\nimperfections, it--and other trade agreements--plays to\nour strengths, including setting regulatory standards\nand creating open spaces in which our market actors can\noperate. China is forced to compete on a national level\nbecause it does not have the diversity of partners and\nallies (trade and otherwise) that we do. We have\npartners and allies for a reason: they amplify U.S.\nstrengths and help us to operate more successfully in\nthe international economy. We should be broadening and\ndeepening these relationships to take advantage of what\nhas been built over the last 70 years.\nQ.4. Are there particular sectors of regions, like Latin\nAmerica, where we need to be smarter and more agile in\nresponding to and getting ahead of this challenge?\nA.4. I believe that, in Latin America and in Africa, there are\nopportunities for us to be far more effective in our economic\ndiplomacy. The United States should be identifying\nopportunities for U.S. economic activity as well as development\nsupport, and should make the investments necessary to take\nadvantage of these opportunities.\nIn my research, I have seen clear frustration with China in\nLatin America and Africa. The Chinese model of operations is\nnot popular. We can and should provide an alternative that\nempowers local populations, invests in them and creates deep,\nsustainable relationships.\nQ.5. What is your assessment of the risk posed by the current\ntreatment of Hong Kong as a separate and favorable customs\nentity for the export of dual-use and other sensitive U.S.\ntechnologies which can then be reexported to the PRC? Given the\ncontinued erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy and Beijing's ever-\ngreater control, has the time come to treat Hong Kong and the\nmainland the same for purposes of these sensitive technology\nexports under U.S. law?\nA.5. I would defer to others on the specifics of how Hong Kong\nis treated for export control purposes, but I would agree that\ntreating Hong Kong as a completely separable entity is\ninconsistent with realities on the ground. It does make sense\nto me to harmonize our approaches with respect to Hong Kong and\nChina, though I would be reluctant to do so if it helped the\nChinese Government assert in legal terms its ability to\ndominate the Hong Kong Government.\nQ.6. I was shocked when the Administration rolled back\npenalties for ZTE last year in the rush to get a trade deal.\nAnd I'm still concerned with the President's recent comments\nsuggesting that loosening restrictions on Huawei could again be\npart of some transactional give-and-take in the broader trade\ndispute. Do you believe the Administration's approach with\nrespect to ZTE and Huawei will achieve our goals of protecting\nour national security and communications infrastructure?\nA.6. No, I do not believe the Administration's approach is in\nour national security interest vis-a-vis ZTE and Huawei, nor in\nour overall messaging to China.\nTrade is a crucial national interest and resolving the\ntrade dispute with China is important.\nHowever, in my view, it is vital to maintain distinctions\nbetween instruments that we use to address trade disputes--such\nas tariffs--and instruments we use to address national security\nproblems, such as sanctions and export controls.\nIn my view, the president's conflation of these sets of\ntools and interests creates dangerous perceptions in China and\nprecedents more generally. It suggests that we do not use\nsanctions as a means of securing our national security\ninterests, but rather as a cudgel to receive trade benefits.\nThis undermines our credibility when we argue that sanctions\nagainst third parties--such as Iran--are entirely separate from\nour domestic economic priorities. It also creates a sense that\nwe are prepared to discount our national security interest for\nimproved trade access.\nIn this way, the Trump administration has implicitly argued\nthat it is worth compromising our Iran sanctions (with ZTE, for\nexample) in order to improve our trade balance. I do not\nbelieve this is necessary or sound.\nQ.7. I have made the point to the Administration that if we are\ngoing to compete with Huawei on 5G architecture it's not enough\nto confront China on predatory economic practices or security\nrisk--both of which are real--but that we must also be at the\nforefront of constructing public-private partnerships, with our\nallies and partners, to assure that there is an alternative\narchitecture--economically viable, secure, and with appropriate\nprivacy safeguards. What is your assessment of this sort of\napproach?\nA.7. I agree with this approach.\nThe United States has been successful in the last 100 years\nnot only because it is powerful but because it is seen as a\nmore stable, mutually beneficial, and ultimately beneficent\npartner.\nIt remains in our interest to not only use our strength for\nour needs of the moment, but also to reinforce these views so\nthat we can harness these strengths in the long term. A long-\nterm approach that builds in the partnership of private sector\nentities and foreign Governments to create a stable, durable\narchitecture would be far more effective.\nQ.8. Are there particular sectors--AI, machine learning,\ngenomics, biometrics, quantum computing--where you see\nparticular U.S. vulnerabilities? How do we best safeguard our\nedge in those areas?\nA.8. I would defer to others with respect to particular\nsectors, but believe that the systemic vulnerability that we\nface is lost confidence in the durability of trade and\ninvestment relationships with the United States.\nThe United States faces a credibility issue right now\ninternationally that is making it harder for foreign partners\nto want to invest here, conduct R&D here, and to trust that\ntheir interests will be respected in the long term. A drift\ntoward mercantilism is, in my view, our greatest vulnerability,\nas well as a sense of a persistent zero sum game with partners\nas well as adversaries.\nThis, in many ways, can affect each one of those\ntechnological subsectors.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR WARREN\nFROM RICHARD NEPHEW\nQ.1. What steps should the United States be taking, that it is\ncurrently not taking, to counter the influence of China's Belt\nand Road Initiative (BRI) in countries that have a demand for\ninfrastructure and other public projects, so that those\ncountries have a viable alternative to surrendering their\nstrategic infrastructure to China?\nA.1. In my opinion, BRI is an attractive proposition for many\ncountries because of the absence of alternatives. These\ncountries may not be interested in supporting the Chinese\npolitical agenda but they have a natural and strong desire to\nadvance their own national interests, and may not be concerned\nabout the geostrategic implications of their actions.\nThe United States has three sets of options, which are not\nmutually exclusive but would involve somewhat different tools.\nFirst and foremost, the United States can and should work\nwith countries considering participation in BRI to ensure that\nprojects are undertaken with the greatest possible\ntransparency. BRI is creating real risks of corruption in\ncountries that participate as well as unsustainable debt\nproblems. The United States can and should shine a light on\nthese projects so that national business communities and\npopulations understand what is involved and, where necessary,\nencourage more appropriate and sustainable terms.\nThe Sri Lanka case demonstrates clearly what can happen\nwhen debt problems as well as unfavorable terms combine. \\1\\\nThe United States should use its diplomatic presence to advise\nGovernments against entering into such arrangements and to\noffer advice as how to manage the opportunities created by BRI.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ https://www.france24.com/en/20190324-sri-lanka-new-chinese-\nsilk-road-disappointment-economy-debt-italy-france-investment\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSecond, the United States should encourage China to\nreconsider its approach to debtor States. Through the Paris\nClub and other mechanisms, the United States has been a\nbeneficent lender, offering debt relief and cancellation when\nnecessary and appropriate. China should be encouraged to do the\nsame, with political pressure applied on a multilateral basis\nto offer weight to this encouragement. Here, cooperation with\nStates that intend to participate in BRI is essential to avoid\nthis becoming another in a long line of U.S.-China disputes.\nThird, the United States should consider carefully whether\nit wishes to compete on similar terms with the Chinese in\nadvancing development projects through the BRI-targeted areas.\nFinancially, this would be difficult and costly. However,\nthe United States continues to have advantages that China does\nnot, including the support of a large network of partner and\nallied States that may be willing to work with the United\nStates to develop and execute infrastructure projects in the\nsame areas. The United States can utilize the multilateral\ndevelopment banks, including the World Bank, in order to\ndevelop and execute these projects.\nI do not believe that a more aggressive approach--including\nthe threat of U.S. sanctions and other pressure mechanisms--\nwill be effective. Threats of consequences and punishment are\nlikely to be counterproductive politically and do not address\nthe sorts of interests that make BRI attractive to these\ncountries.\nQ.2. Does the successful penetration of China's Belt and Road\nInitiative (BRI) into economies in Europe, Latin America, and\nAfrica increase the likelihood that authoritarianism and\ncorruption will corrode the political systems of countries in\nthose parts of the world? Please give a brief assessment.\nA.2. I do have some concerns about the possibilities of\ncorruption being attached to BRI projects. Large-scale\ndevelopment projects do come along with a substantial risk of\ngraft due to the sums of money involved as well as the absence\nof appropriate controls to manage these risks. It is not clear\nto me that BRI has been appropriately structured to avoid these\nrisks, though certainly Chinese officials have underscored\ntheir own concerns about corruption (which is also an important\nissue at home as well).\nAuthoritarianism is a somewhat different issue. My\nassessment is that some of the countries involved are already\nunder authoritarian regimes and that BRI projects may reduce\npressures that might otherwise undermine these regimes. By\ngranting these Governments economic opportunities for\ndevelopment, BRI may help them burnish their domestic\ncredentials and help manage domestic constituencies that\notherwise could push for political change.\nAt the same time, I do not think that BRI in and of itself\nwill create these dynamics. Rather, it may reinforce these\ndynamics that do exist because of an absence of interest on the\npart of Chinese officials on political modernization and\nchange.\nQ.3. Aside from using tariffs, sanctions, export controls, and\nother tools of economic statecraft to punish China for\nanticompetitive and coercive economic practices, what domestic\npolicy tools should the United States be using to strengthen\nour competitiveness and reduce wealth inequality here at home--\nregarding basic and applied research, public education,\ninfrastructure, and other investments?\nA.3. As a scholar of economic statecraft, it is apparent that\nthe absence of investment in U.S. domestic projects (from R&D\nto education to infrastructure) is a long-term threat to U.S.\neconomic viability and national power.\nThe United States has obtained a privileged international\nposition economically and politically because of the\nattractiveness of business opportunities here, the stability of\nour Government and economic structures, the rule of law, and\nour relatively well-educated and capable population. But, these\nare the results of investments made domestically--especially\nfollowing the Second World War--that are not necessarily self-\nsustaining.\nI would support expanded investment in domestic capacities\nat home, particularly as relates to managing income and wealth\ninequality, as essential elements of maintaining our\ninternational economic power and the continued viability of our\ngeneral economic model.\nIn my view, this would require a range of policies\nincluding, among other things:\nRestoring fairness in our tax code to reduce the\nwealth gap, especially with the mega-rich;\nAddressing the burdens created by excessive student\nloan debt, which drags on the economy as a whole and\nundermines the generations now joining the work and\nconsumer force;\nInvesting in research and development for new\ntechnologies and techniques in manufacturing;\nInvesting in research and development for new\ntechnologies and techniques for the production of\ncarbon neutral energy;\nEstablishing incentive structures for companies\nthat appropriately compensate their workers and impose\nconsequences on those that do not;\nInvestigating and prosecuting corruption,\nparticularly when involving Government officials; and,\nAddressing problems of systemic economic unfairness\nand wealth inequality, which creates a variety of\nsocial and economic ills.\nIn my opinion, the United States has a rare opportunity to\ndemonstrate that its economic model can be reformed and work in\nsupport of its entire population, presenting a counter example\nto the Chinese model and others that may seek to compete with\nus in the future.\nQ.4. Fentanyl--In Massachusetts, health providers, first\nresponders, and public officials have worked together in their\ncommunities in an effort to tackle the opioid crisis that has\naffected families across my State. While there are signs that\nmany of these efforts are having an impact in reducing the\nnumber of opioid overdose deaths, the illicit use of fentanyl,\nan extremely dangerous synthetic opioid, continues to fuel this\nepidemic. In 2018, for opioid-related overdose deaths in which\na toxicology screen was available, fentanyl was present in 89\npercent of them.\nThe State Department's most recent annual International\nNarcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) observes, ``In\nDecember 2018, China committed to control fentanyl compounds as\na class. Once implemented, this move should help thwart illicit\nchemists and manufacturers who quickly change their illicit\nformulations to nonregulated analogues to evade law\nenforcement.'' Has China's commitment produced this outcome?\nA.4. Yes, China has modified its legislation to address this\nproblem in early April. The revised legislation went into\neffect on 1 May.\nIt is still too soon to be able to say with any authority\nwhether the changes in legislation have been matched by changes\nin enforcement.\nQ.5. Referring to China, the State Department's INCSR observes,\n``U.S. law enforcement reports that the most common diversion\ntactic used by traffickers is the intentional mislabeling of\nshipments containing precursors. Perpetrators caught\nmislabeling precursor shipments often face only civil penalties\nand small fines rather than criminal charges. The challenge of\npreventing precursor diversion is further exacerbated by\nChina's ineffective enforcement of land, air, and sea transport\nregulations.'' Aside from revising its laws and regulations,\nworking with U.S. law enforcement partners and the Postal\nService, and cooperating with international regulatory efforts\nlike the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), what\nadditional steps should the Chinese Government be taking to\nensure that its relevant authorities are properly scheduling\nfentanyl analogues, tracking trends in the illicit fentanyl\nmarket, and holding traffickers and their affiliates\naccountable?\nA.5. The most important step for China to take now is to\nresource and empower adequately those enforcement entities in\nthe country that are responsible for countering illicit\ntrafficking.\nCreating a legislative mandate is useful but absent\nofficials who are empowered to identify, investigate and arrest\nthose engaged in illicit trade, this mandate will be ultimately\nuseless.\nImportantly, a result of these investigations will be\nadditional insight into how traffickers operate and how they\nare adapting to the legislation that is now in effect.\nIdeally, internal Chinese developments will then be fed\nback into a diplomatic process--run by the State Department's\nINL Bureau in cooperation with domestic law enforcement\nagencies--that will allow the United States to adapt its own\napproaches here. For example, if Chinese investigators learn of\na new tactic to evade postal inspections, then it would be\nappropriate (and, in my view, necessary) for China to share\nthat with the U.S. State Department.\nSuch an evolution in the U.S.-China relationship on this\nmatter would also demonstrate that China is not merely\nattempting to convince the United States that fentanyl is no\nlonger a problem but rather taking concrete steps to ensure\nthat it is not one.\nQ.6. Do you believe that Justice Department indictments of, and\nTreasury Department sanctions against, alleged Chinese fentanyl\nmanufacturers and distributors have a meaningful deterrent\neffect on Chinese fentanyl trafficking networks?\nA.6. I believe that indictments probably have a limited\ndeterrent effect on Chinese manufacturers and distributors who\nhave no intention of traveling either to the United States or\nto jurisdictions where extradition is likely.\nSanctions may likewise have a limited effect if their only\noperative mechanisms are asset freezes and visa bans. On the\nother hand, if the U.S. sanctions toolkit were to expand (as\nwith the Fentanyl Sanctions Act), then distributors and\ntraffickers may have a more complicated set of decisions to\nmake. For this reason, I believe that sanctions utility is\ndirectly related to the range of options that are available to\nthe U.S. Executive Branch. With more options, the United States\ncan choose to impose sanctions against a wider range of\nentities and individuals (including companies that are engaged\nin the provision of precursor chemicals to illicit traffickers)\nand with more specificity in the measures selected so as to\nensure the pain applied is targeted, tailored, and severe.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF\nSENATOR CORTEZ MASTO FROM RICHARD NEPHEW\nQ.1. I have heard repeatedly from U.S. companies that are\nconcerned about forced technology transfer as a precondition\nfor doing business in China. The Chinese Government passed a\nnew Foreign Investment Law earlier this year, which the\nGovernment claims will address some of those issues.\nSince the passage of China's Foreign Investment Law earlier\nthis year, have you seen any indications that the Chinese\nGovernment may actually curtail forced technology transfer, and\nother tactics used to steal intellectual property?\nA.1. I believe that it is probably too early to say whether the\nlaw will be implemented in a manner that is consistent with\nU.S. and other countries' expectations for the protection of\nintellectual property.\nCertainly, China is making clear that it understands the\nimportance of this issue to its investment attractiveness. For\nexample, on 20 June, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang met with 19\nlarge multinational companies and restated the Chinese\nGovernment's intention to ``create a market-oriented, law-based\ninternationalized business environment.'' \\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/chinas-premier-\ntells-foreign-ceos-china-will-commit-to-reform-opening-up\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBut, this is an issue that requires constant scrutiny,\nmonitoring, and evaluation.\n------\nRESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SINEMA\nFROM RICHARD NEPHEW\nQ.1. Many experts say a multilateral approach will ultimately\nbe needed to hold China accountable for its role in the\nproduction and distribution of illicit fentanyl. Do you share\nthat view?\nA.1. I believe that, as a general rule, sanctions are most\neffective when they have multinational support. Such a\nstructure helps to prevent evasion and cheating; manage\npolitical debates about the value, utility, and ethics of\nsanctions; and, create the maximum pressure on sanctions'\nintended targets.\nThat said, in the near term, I would anticipate that the\nunique nature of this problem--which, as I understand it, still\nis largely confined to North America as a crisis--may lend\nitself to more unilateral approaches. But, as this problem\nbecomes more global and as political pressure builds on all\npotential suppliers to do more to arrest illicit trafficking,\nthen I would also anticipate other States being willing to join\nour efforts.\nQ.2. Do you feel that the Administration's policies and\nrhetoric on trade could undermine the necessary goodwill to\nwork collaboratively with our trading partners to hold China\naccountable and stop the flow of fentanyl?\nA.2. Yes, I believe that the Trump administration's approach to\ninternational relations--particularly with our partners but\nalso with China--are a hindrance in our efforts to address this\nproblem.\nThus far, China has continued to make progress--at least in\na legislative sense--in working to prevent trafficking,\nnotwithstanding the broader challenges that exist in the U.S.-\nChina relationship.\nBut, China scholars have warned that the U.S. approach may\nundermine China's willingness and ability to work on this\nproblem.\nMoreover, the degree to which the United States is\nperceived as sanctioning everyone and everything in reach and\nfor a variety of reasons (in pursuit of trade deals; to manage\nthe situation with Iran and North Korea; to support human\nrights) may make it much harder to bring international partners\ninto a workable coalition with us.\nAdditional Material Supplied for the Record\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]",

Lisa\nMurkowski, Chairman of the Committee, presiding.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. LISA MURKOWSKI,\nU.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA\nThe Chairman. Thank you for covering, Senator Manchin, I\nappreciate it.\nI apologize to members of the Committee and to our honored\nguests. Thank you for being here this morning. I am going to\napologize for my voice. I have kennel cough or something, I\ndon't know. Awful.\n[Laughter.]\nWe are here this morning to examine the expanded deployment\nof grid-scale energy storage. As with many of our hearings in\nthis Congress, this is part of our Committee's ongoing efforts\nto address climate change by promoting the development of\ninnovative and clean energy technologies.\nEarlier in the year we held scene-setting hearings on\nopportunities for energy innovation and climate change in the\nelectricity sector. We have discussed the prospects for\nadvanced nuclear, renewables, energy efficiency, and carbon\ncapture, utilization and sequestration, CCUS. We have just done\nsome really supercool things in this Committee, just saying.\nIn those hearings, our witnesses emphasized that innovative\ntechnologies present a tremendous opportunity to reduce\ngreenhouse gas emissions on a large scale, and that we can\nseize the opportunity by focusing on policies that will lower\nthe cost and increase the deployment of these technologies.\nSo we are working hard in the Committee to do just that. We\nare taking this challenge seriously. We understand that if we\nare going to be serious about addressing climate change, we\nneed to come together----\nSenator Manchin. Hold on, here we go.\nThe Chairman. Thank you. This is teamwork, yes. Sorry,\nfolks. There, look at how miraculous.\nWe are taking this challenge seriously. We understand if we\nare going to be serious about addressing climate change, we\nneed to come together on practical and effective solutions that\nwill reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. CCUS and nuclear\nenergy will play a major role in these efforts and so will the\ntopic of today's hearing, which is energy storage.\nPut simply, energy storage is the process of capturing\nelectricity from the grid and storing it for future on-demand\nuse. This technology can take many forms, including pumped\nhydropower, grid-scale batteries, and flywheels.\nEnergy storage resources present a win-win opportunity to\nmake the grid cleaner, more resilient, and more affordable. By\nstoring power when it is cheapest and dispatching it during\npeak demand periods when power is most expensive, energy\nstorage can significantly lower consumers' power bills. It can\nalso help avoid or defer the need to build out additional\nelectric generation, transmission, and distribution\ninfrastructure.\nEnergy storage can play a key role in our nation's ongoing\ntransition from large and predictable generation resources to a\ndecentralized and more intermittent supply. Specifically,\nenergy storage can pair with variable resources like wind and\nsolar to make their output more consistent and avoid the wear\nand tear and uncertainty caused by irregular power flows.\nWe have certainly seen how this works back in my State of\nAlaska. Chugach Electric Association in Anchorage--they have\ndeployed a flywheel and battery system to integrate fluctuating\nwind power and improve the energy stability. Kodiak also uses\nbatteries and flywheels to help smooth out the wind energy\nthere. We took Secretary Perry out last year. He was quite\nimpressed by what he saw and how they had used the batteries\nto, again, smooth the whole system. Later this week, I am going\nto be going out to a fabulous little community of Cordova. They\nare going to have a ribbon-cutting there for a new energy\nstorage system. They are going to pair a battery with\nhydropower to lower their energy costs in that little fishing\nvillage and reduce their reliance on diesel fuel. So as usual,\nAlaskans are innovating in some pretty exciting technologies.\nToday we will examine the state of energy storage\ntechnologies, the regulatory and economic challenges of\ndeploying more of these technologies, and how the Federal\nGovernment can partner with industry to get more of these\ntechnologies on the grid.\nWe have a great panel here with us this morning. Before I\nintroduce them, I will turn to Senator Manchin for his opening\nstatement.\nAgain, thank you, Senator Manchin and to my colleagues.\nSTATEMENT OF HON. JOE MANCHIN III,\nU.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA\nSenator Manchin. Chair Murkowski, thank you for holding a\nhearing today on grid-scale energy storage. I would like to\nwelcome our witnesses and thank you all for joining us to talk\nabout how storage technologies can help us address some of our\ngreatest challenges like climate change and energy cost.\nBut before we jump in, I would like to acknowledge one of\nour witnesses, Andy Ott. Andy has recently announced that he\nwill be retiring at the end of the month after a successful\n22--is that correct, Andy?--22-year tenure running the largest\ngrid in North America, which is PJM. Andy, I want to thank you\nagain for being here today, and thank you for your service all\nthese years. We wish you nothing but the best in the future.\nGrid-scale energy storage is a hot topic these days, and\nfor good reason. Energy storage is needed to achieve the full\npotential of renewable energy. It is really a key enabling\ntechnology to a low carbon, modern grid that will help us\nachieve our carbon emissions reductions and address climate\nchange.\nStorage allows us to dispatch energy during times of peak\ndemand, enhance the reliability of our grid, provide energy\nsecurity and backup power for customers, and enable increased\nflexibility for helping to manage the continued growth of\nrenewable generation on our system. Storage can also help defer\ndistribution system upgrades and it can be installed quickly\ncompared to traditional generation, bringing better value to\ncustomers while maintaining reliability.\nSeveral members of this Committee have introduced bills to\nadvance storage this Congress. The Administration proposed an\nincrease in energy storage R&D and a new cross-cutting\ninitiative to address the remaining barriers.\nFurthermore, FERC has been working to make sure owners and\noperators of storage resources have fair and equal access to\ncompetitive wholesale energy markets. Meanwhile, system\noperators, utilities, and generators are working out the\ndetails in the energy markets.\nWith all this activity, I would say this hearing is going\nto be very timely.\nI look forward to hearing from the panel about how to\nprioritize taxpayer dollars to create the most value for energy\nstorage, both now and in the future.\nI don't think anyone here will disagree that more work\nneeds to be done to advance storage technology or bolster\nexisting technologies like lithium-ion batteries, which is\ncurrently our best bet for chemical batteries.\nIn an editorial published on May 14th, Bill Gates stressed\nthe importance of energy storage as one of the three key\ntechnology suites we should be pursuing in addition to advanced\nnuclear, carbon capture, and better transmission lines.\nWhile battery technology has a long way to go, costs are\ncoming down. In 2010 the cost of lithium-ion batteries was\nabout $1,000 per kilowatt-hour. Now we are down to about $200\nper kilowatt-hour which is great progress, but it is not\nenough.\nThere are problems with lithium-ion. I understand that we\nmay not be able to get the cost down to much below $100 per\nkilowatt-hour. Also, we have only one active lithium operation\nin the U.S. and are otherwise dependent on foreign countries to\nsupply this critical material, which is why I am the lead\nDemocrat on Senator Murkowski's American Mineral Security Act,\nas well as the sponsor of the Rare Earth Elements Advanced Coal\nTechnology Act, which highlights the work that WVU and NETL are\ndoing to extract these materials from coal by-products.\nSo while we discuss the advancement of storage technologies\nhere today, I want to remind my colleagues of the importance of\nthe supply chain of materials needed to actually manufacture\nenergy storage resources.\nFurthermore, energy storage won't be one-size-fits-all. We\nneed several different types of storage technologies available\nto us so we can find the right tool for the job to store energy\nfor later use.\nI look forward to a robust discussion on what policies we\nneed to get a suite of storage technologies ready to go and to\nthe point of being cost-effective. We also need your help to\nsee around the next corner to make sure we are preparing our\nenergy grid to handle the energy demands of the future while\nalso preparing our economy and our workforce to be competitive\nand robust in a global market.\nI don't think anyone here will disagree that more work\nneeds to be done to advance storage technology to bolster\nexisting technologies like lithium-ion batteries. We have only\none in the U.S.\nI also briefly mentioned one type of storage that might not\nbe as flashy and new as some of the other emerging\ntechnologies, but it is critical nonetheless. Pumped-storage\nhydropower represents 95 percent, and I repeat, 95 percent, of\ninstalled storage capacity in the U.S. today. It is renewable,\nzero carbon and tried and true.\nI would like to see more pumped-storage deployment in\nstates like West Virginia where we have the needed topography\nand water. I know that Brookfield already operates the Hawks\nNest hydro facility in West Virginia and one of the largest\npumped-storage hydro facilities in Massachusetts. I hope to\nhear about any pumped-storage development the panelists may\nhave in the works and how we, in Congress, can help advance\nthose efforts.\nAs I have said before, we need to be nurturing and\nadvancing all technologies that can help us combat climate\nchange.\nI want to say one thing off script. The Chairman and I just\ncame back from a trip to the Arctic, and we met with all the\nArctic nations. What I took away from that trip was this: not\none, including Russia, has used climate change as a political\ndivider. They all know it is life or death up there for them to\nsurvive in that fragile ecosystem. It was unbelievable to walk\naway seeing everybody from the far right to the far left and\nanywhere in between trying to find an answer on how to subvert\nthis, because it is real and it is damaging. It is going to\naffect all of our lives, and we have that responsibility. It\nwas an unbelievable trip that was most educational and\nenlightening for me.\nI look forward to working with my colleagues on the Energy\nCommittee to explore how energy storage can be leveraged in\nconjunction with other grid assets to bring to bear the\ngreatest benefits for the grid, its customers and its\nenvironments.\nWe have a lot to cover today, and I look forward to hearing\nfrom our panelists. I want to thank you, Madam Chairman, for\nthis hearing.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator.\nYou remind us all that we have a lot of good work to do in\nthis Committee and I think that we are really helping to lead\ngood, constructive discussions about what is out there, how we\nare working to make a difference when it comes to these\ntechnologies that will help deliver clean, efficient energy\nsources that reduce our emissions.\nLet's begin with our distinguished panel this morning. Dr.\nGeorge Crabtree is the Director of the Joint Center for Energy\nStorage Research (JCESR) at Argonne National Laboratory. We\nwelcome you. Mr. Mitch Davidson is the CEO of Brookfield\nRenewable, welcome. Mr. Ben Fowke is the CEO of Xcel Energy. We\nhave Mr. Kiran Kumaraswamy, who is the Vice President for\nMarket Applications at Fluence, and Mr. Andrew Ott, who is the\nPresident and CEO of PJM Interconnection.\nDr. Crabtree, if you would like to begin. We would ask you\nto all try to keep your comments to about five minutes. Your\nfull statements will be included as part of the record, then we\nwill have an opportunity for questions.\nPlease proceed.\nSTATEMENT OF DR. GEORGE CRABTREE, ARGONNE NATIONAL LABORATORY\nAND UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO, DIRECTOR, JOINT CENTER\nFOR ENERGY STORAGE RESEARCH\nDr. Crabtree. Thank you.\nChairman Murkowski, Ranking Member Manchin and\ndistinguished members of the Committee, I'm honored to testify\nbefore you at this hearing.\nThis is a time of great transition in the electric grid.\nEfforts are underway to strengthen its resilience and\nreliability against extreme weather and against possible\ncyberattacks to decarbonize it and to incorporate renewable\nenergy into it.\nEver since the grid was born in the 19th century, it has\noperated under a highly constraining principle and that is, we\nmust generate electricity at the same rate that we use it. This\nrequires minute-by-minute matching of generation to demand and\nthis elaborate balancing act has serious downsides. One is that\nwe must build the grid to meet the peak demand and the peak\ndemand is about 40 percent higher than the average demand. That\nmeans that we're building 40 percent more infrastructure than\nwe need. If energy storage were cheap enough, we could imagine\na fully modern grid, running continuously at its most efficient\nlevel to meet the average demand. The modern grid would store\nexcess generated electricity when demand is low and release it\nwhen demand is high.\nWith regard to expediting the grid transition, I would like\nto share a few fundamental messages with the Committee. First,\nenergy storage plays many pivotal roles in all sectors of the\ngrid, that includes electricity generation, transmission and\ndistribution. There are probably more than 20 pivotal roles\nthat must be addressed. Second, energy storage technology is\nadvancing rapidly but we urgently need significant research\nadvances to develop the storage technologies that will enable\nthe full transition to a modern grid. Third, we are just now\ndiscovering through early stage deployments the best practices\nfor deploying energy storage in the highest impact and most\ncost-effective manner. We need to encourage many more early\nstage deployments to learn what works and what does not work.\nLastly, storage plays a central role, not only in transforming\nthe electric grid, but also in transforming other critical\nareas of the economy, that includes ground-based transportation\nthrough electric cars and trucks and aviation through air\ntaxis, package delivery, and regional passenger flight. What's\nmore, the military has all of the storage needs of the civilian\neconomy as well as special storage needs for surveillance,\nweaponry and resilient worldwide bases that operate\nindependently of the local grid for up to several months.\nAdvances in storage for the grid will spill over to advance the\nfrontiers of these other critical areas of the economy.\nWhat unites all of these messages is the single key\nmessage, the urgent need to advance the state-of-the-art of\nbattery R&D.\nCongress and the Federal Government have taken the\nchallenge seriously with the creation in 2012 of the Joint\nCenter for Energy Storage Research, or JCESR for short. JCESR\nis led by Argonne National Laboratory. At its foundation, JCESR\ncomprised 20 leading R&D institutions, including national labs,\nuniversities, and industry. These institutions have been\nworking collaboratively to create the battery science and\ntechnology needed to support the emerging transformations of\nthe electric grid, as well as ground transportation and flight.\nJCESR has drawn its talent from across the United States,\nincluding MIT in the East, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in\nthe West, and everything in between. Such a collection of\nenergy storage talent, it's a real dream team, cannot be found\nin any single institution.\nAs the saying goes, ``The proof is in the pudding.'' In its\nfirst 5 years JCESR has many accomplishments to its credit and\nyou can read what those are in my written testimony, but most\nimportant, JCESR promised to deliver two prototype batteries,\none for the grid and one for transportation. In fact, JCESR\nactually delivered four prototypes, two for the grid and two\nfor transportation. This effort led to important breakthroughs\nin advancing the state-of-the-art of four types of advanced\nbatteries beyond the conventional lithium-ion.\nThree numbers give you a quick sense of JCESR's impact: 450\nscientific journal publications to date; 95 graduate student\nand post-doctoral alumni now working in academia, national labs\nand industry to advance U.S. battery research and development;\nand the formation of three startups. One of those startups,\nForm Energy, is pursuing commercialization of one of JCESR's\nprototypes--a water-based, air breathing sulfur battery.\nIn September 2018, the Department of Energy renewed JCESR\nfor a second 5-year period. In the renewal, JCESR is shifting\nits focus from particular battery systems to transformational\nbattery materials. We realized toward the end of our first term\nthat even if all four of our prototypes went to\ncommercialization, this would not come close to satisfying the\nurgent need for a diversity of new battery materials for a\ndiversity of emerging applications.\nIn closing, I'd like to reiterate that energy storage will\nplay a vital role in the transformation of the electric grid\nspanning generation, transmission, and distribution. We're\nstill in the initial steps of that transformation, but we have\nnot yet walked through the door. Achieving this transformation\nrequires developing an energy storage ecosystem that spans\nresearch development and deployment.\nThank you.\n[The prepared statement of Dr. Crabtree follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Dr. Crabtree.\nMr. Davidson, welcome.\nSTATEMENT OF F. MITCHELL DAVIDSON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER,\nU.S., BROOKFIELD RENEWABLE\nMr. Davidson. Chairman Murkowski, Ranking Member Manchin\nand members of the Committee, my name is Mitch Davidson. I am\nthe CEO of Brookfield Renewable's U.S. business, and I\nappreciate the opportunity to be here today.\nBrookfield Renewable owns and operates one of the world's\nlargest renewable energy portfolios which includes 900\nrenewable power facilities with a total install capacity of\n17,500 megawatts. Included in our U.S. portfolio are 137 hydro\nfacilities--many of which are frequently the largest taxpayers\nin the rural communities in which they reside, 26 wind farms,\nand 490 solar installations, totaling 6,500 megawatts of\ncapacity. We operate these resources within a binding global\ncommitment to safety, environmental responsibility and\ncommunity engagement.\nHydropower is a proven long-life resource providing\ncritical, baseload and peaking power and delivering a variety\nof important reliability benefits, all with zero emissions.\nHydropower is a most efficient technology for storing energy\nand is capable of providing a firm capacity with the ability to\nfollow dispatch orders without the loss of its renewable\nresource.\nThese assets also provide valuable ancillary services such\nas operating reserves, frequency regulation, power support and\nblack start capabilities.\nReservoir hydroelectric resources store water during the\nspring snow melt or rainy season. We think of this as stored\nfuel and turn that stored fuel into energy during the peak\nperiods of summer and winter months. For example, on a single\nriver in Maine, we control three large reservoirs and seven\ngeneration stations which provide the fuel security equivalent\nof 30 days of stored energy.\nPumped hydro has the ability to become a significant load\nduring periods of low demand. This excess load can minimize\nproduction changes for large baseload units, thereby enhancing\ntheir efficiencies and minimizing the risk associated with\noperational changes or capture energy from intermittent\nresources which on many occasions would have otherwise been\ncurtailed during those periods.\nThe 600-megawatt Bear Swamp pump hydro facility, which is\njointly owned by ourselves and Emera Energy, began generating\nelectricity in 1974. During the charging cycle the facility\npumps approximately 4,600-acre feet of water uphill into a\nreservoir. The facility can reach maximum output from a\nstandstill in three minutes and is capable of taking 600\nmegawatts of excess generation off the grid to generating 600\nmegawatts for the grid in under 30 minutes. This 12,000-\nmegawatt swing with the ability to maintain output for up to\nsix hours are reasons why the ISO New England operation staff\nbelieve the facility is critical to the reliability of the\nelectric system.\nBear Swamp is currently undergoing an upgrade and a\nrelicensing. Once completed, it will be capable of producing\n660 megawatts at six percent greater efficiency with a reduced\ntime of pumping to full capacity by an entire hour. Following\nthese upgrades, Bear Swamp will have essentially two new\ngeneration units thereby prolonging the useful life of the\nasset up to 50 years.\nHydropower is the largest generator of renewable energy in\nthe country providing grid resiliency, fuel security and\nability to balance valuable resources. These assets should be\nconsidered energy infrastructure, critical energy\ninfrastructure. Hydropower has consistently delivered these\nattributes during severe weather conditions, weather conditions\nwhich have posed challenges for many other generation\nresources. For example, during the Northeast severe cold\nweather event that occurred December 2017 through January 2018,\nour hydroelectric generation resources continued to operate at\ntheir planned levels of production with many of our assets\noperating at levels of 50 percent above expectations.\nHydropower facilities are capital intensive assets.\nUnfortunately, many renewable portfolio standards favor new\nrenewable generation to existing hydro, putting hydro assets\nwhich have superior dispatch capabilities at an economic\ndisadvantage. As policymakers consider ways to further reduce\nemissions, it is critical that existing hydropower be treated\non par with other renewable resources.\nIn closing, I would like to reiterate that hydropower is a\ncritical component of this country's energy infrastructure and\na resilient electric grid. With the right regulatory policies\nand economic signals, hydropower will continue to enable the\nlarge-scale development of valuable renewable energy resources.\nI appreciate your time, and I look forward to your\nquestions.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Davidson follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Davidson.\nMr. Fowke.\nSTATEMENT OF BEN FOWKE, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT, AND CHIEF\nEXECUTIVE OFFICER, XCEL ENERGY INC.\nMr. Fowke. Chairman Murkowski, Ranking Member Manchin and\ndistinguished members of the Committee, my name is Ben Fowke\nand I'm Chairman, President and CEO of Xcel Energy. I really\nappreciate the opportunity to provide Xcel Energy's perspective\non grid-scale storage and its great potential for the utility\nindustry.\nXcel Energy is a public utility holding company serving 3.6\nmillion electric customers and 2 million natural gas customers.\nHeadquartered in Minneapolis, we serve parts of eight Western\nand Midwestern states including Minnesota, Colorado, North and\nSouth Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Texas and New Mexico.\nXcel Energy is leading the way to a clean energy future by\ntransitioning away from coal to renewables and other cleaner\ntechnologies, all while keeping electricity rates affordable\nand our system reliable. We already have achieved a 38 percent\nsystem-wide reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from 2005\nlevels and we're aiming to go much higher.\nXcel Energy is the first utility in the country to announce\nthe goal of providing carbon-free electricity by 2050 with a\nnear-term target of reducing carbon emissions by 80 percent by\n2030. This vision is ambitious and its success depends of the\ndevelopment of new technologies that will continue to ensure a\nreliable, affordable grid.\nThose new technologies will undoubtedly include energy\nstorage. We have been increasing our understanding of storage\nand how it works on our system, particularly pumped hydro and\nbatteries. For 50 years we've operated a 324-megawatt pumped-\nstorage facility in Colorado. We have also learned more about\nthe value of battery storage through innovative pilot projects\nin Minnesota and Colorado. I'm excited about the possibilities\nof grid-scale storage technologies and the potential services\nand value they can offer our customers. While we're in the\nearly days of energy storage and many challenges remain, I\nbelieve storage has the potential to play an important role in\nthe electric grid of the future.\nWind and solar provide low-priced, clean energy to our\ncustomers but they are intermittent and seasonal. Grid-scale\nstorage can help with renewable integration allowing higher\nrenewable energy penetration levels than would otherwise be\npossible.\nStorage can also provide other importance to the grid and\ncustomers, including more reliable grid operations, voltage\nsupport, frequency control. Already batteries are being used to\nprovide backup power to customers with specific power quality\nneeds. Electric utilities are currently taking advantage of\nmany different values of grid-scale storage. In fact, utilities\nare the leading developers of storage technologies in the\nnation.\nIn Colorado, for example, we're calling for up to 275\nmegawatts of storage capacity in our Colorado energy plant. The\nstorage capacity proposal is one of the largest of its kind in\nthe country. I'm excited by the potential value of storage,\nespecially as the technology advances and the prices decline.\nWhile the possibilities of storage technology are certainly\npromising, many people have misconceptions that batteries can\naddress all future challenges of a clean energy grid. In fact,\nbatteries and other storage technologies still have limitations\nand like all things in energy, there is no silver bullet.\nFirst, storage today cannot solve the problem of wide\nseasonal variation in renewable energy generation which is the\nchief factor preventing the creation of a fully renewable\nelectricity system. Today's best battery storage systems\nprovide a few hours of storage for a few megawatt-hours of\nenergy. However, for a fully renewable grid, we would need to\nstore huge amounts of energy for months at a time. The cost of\nseasonal storage today is prohibitive.\nSecond, while storage can initially help integrate\nrenewables by moving energy from the time it is produced to the\ntime it is needed, the value of each increment of storage\ncapacity declines as more storage is added to the system.\nEventually new storage has little additional value in helping\nintegrate renewables.\nAnd finally, although storage can bring multiple services\nto the grid--power quality and grid support, for example--we\nusually cannot add the value of all of these services together.\nAs a general rule, they're not all available at the same time.\nThe right public policies can help address these\nchallenges. The Federal Government is uniquely positioned to\npromote further energy storage research, development and\ndeployment as part of a larger clean technology program.\nIncentives are also important, but they need to be the right\ndesign to be effective. My written testimony sets forth these\nand other policies we think would support the bright future we\nsee in grid-scale storage.\nIn closing, I'm optimistic about the future for storage\ntechnology and believe it will be an important part of the mix\nas we work toward our vision of a clean energy future that is\nboth reliable and affordable.\nThank you for the opportunity to testify today. I look\nforward to your questions.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Fowke follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Fowke.\nMr. Kumaraswamy.\nSTATEMENT OF KIRAN KUMARASWAMY, VICE PRESIDENT, MARKET\nAPPLICATIONS, FLUENCE\nMr. Kumaraswamy. Good morning, Chairman Murkowski, Ranking\nMember Manchin and distinguished members of the Committee. My\nname is Kiran Kumaraswamy, and I am the Vice President of\nMarket Applications at Fluence. I also serve as a Member of the\nBoard of Directors for the Energy Storage Association, the\nleading national voice of the United States energy storage\nindustry. I am honored to testify in front of you today.\nFluence is an energy storage technology and services\ncompany jointly owned by Siemens and AES Corporation. Fluence\ncombines the engineering and service capabilities of AES and\nSiemens energy storage teams.\nEnergy storage is on the cutting edge of the global energy\ntransition. Bringing increasing amounts of solar and wind power\nonto the grid means planning for a system in which high levels\nof power quality are still essential but variability of\ngeneration is the norm. Energy storage helps us to meet such\nchallenges.\nWith the introduction of energy storage, we can, for the\nfirst time, shift and control with pinpoint accuracy the time\nand location of power delivery. A few key points to note here.\nFirst, energy storage unlocks value in all grid assets by\nimproving their utilization--be it traditional thermal plants\nsuch as gas or nuclear, renewable resources such as wind and\nsolar or the transmission and distribution infrastructure that\ndelivers energy to factories, homes and offices.\nSecond and of equal importance for the U.S. economy, energy\nstorage gives large energy users control over their energy\ncosts by allowing them to decide when to use grid power or\ntheir own reserves.\nThird, the addition of battery storage to gas turbines\nhelps such traditional generators of electricity become more\nflexible and helps manage the gaps between power demand and\nsupply reliably.\nStorage providing peaking capacity is gaining traction\nbroadly across the U.S. Increasingly, utilities are examining\nand selecting large-scale energy storage in lieu of new natural\ngas plants to provide for periods of peak demand. We believe\none of the most transformative uses for energy storage will be\nin the transmission and distribution sector allowing utilities\nto defer or avoid entirely investments in traditional wires\nsolutions.\nAs the economic, environmental and resilience benefits of\nenergy storage are becoming widely accepted, policy must\ncontinue to evolve to ensure storage can compete on a level\nplaying field.\nThe first area of focus is to accurately measure the\ncapacity value of different durations of energy storage in\nregional power markets. Many of the underlying modeling\ntechniques for assessing the capacity value of energy storage\nwere developed within the U.S. Department of Energy's National\nRenewable Energy Laboratory, or NREL. This work is a prime\nexample of how DOE's national labs and other research\ninitiatives have provided expertise and support that have been\nessential to and are still vitally needed for the growth of our\nindustry.\nA second critical need is to remove barriers to energy\nstorage being deployed as a transmission asset. A regulatory\nconstruct for storage-as-transmission is largely undeveloped\nwhich is having a direct impact on the ability to install\nstorage for transmission reliability purposes. Our request is\nfor Congress to direct FERC to open dockets on storage-as-\ntransmission started with either technical conferences or\nnotices of inquiry to inform any potential rulemakings FERC may\ndetermine are merited.\nA third critical need is to take advantage of the unique\nresiliency benefits that energy storage provides in disaster\nresponse and infrastructure planning. To this end, the\nDepartment of Energy could provide significant support in\nstudying and quantifying the value of resilience that energy\nstorage provides to the entire electric network.\nWhile we push hard for progress in each of these critical\nneeds, we also want to recognize the accelerating progress that\nwe have made at the federal and state levels. At the federal\nlevel, FERC Order 841 has injected much needed guidance for\nwholesale power markets to adapt to allow energy storage to\ncompete with other traditional resources. We applaud FERC for\nreaffirming Order 841. At the regional level, we are very\nencouraged by the progress made in various states like New\nYork, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Maryland, California,\nMassachusetts and Colorado.\nThe U.S. currently is the leader in battery storage\ndeployments globally with several countries closely following\nbehind. Removing structural barriers in wholesale power\nmarkets, improving regional planning processes and providing\ncertainty for this industry will continue to help us retain\nthat leadership position.\nChairman Murkowski, thank you for the opportunity to be\nhere today. I am happy to take any questions.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Kumaraswamy follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Thank you.\nMr. Ott, welcome.\nSTATEMENT OF ANDREW L. OTT, PRESIDENT AND CEO,\nPJM INTERCONNECTION\nMr. Ott. Thank you, Chairman Murkowski, Ranking Member\nManchin and members of the Committee.\nI am Andrew Ott. I am the President and CEO of PJM\nInterconnection. I was before you last October to talk about\nsystem restoration and Blackstart, and I am honored to be\ninvited back to talk about the important issue of energy\nstorage.\nPJM operates the largest bulk power grid in the nation, the\nlargest electricity market in the world, population of 65\nmillion people. Our role is three-fold: essentially to ensure\nreliable grid operation, to operate competitive markets that\nessentially yield benefits for competitive investment to\nconsumers and to the economy, and also, of course,\ninfrastructure planning to ensure the grid remains robust and\nreliable into the future.\nToday, I want to underscore a few points on energy storage\nthat are key, I believe. The first is, again, storage is a\nflexible, very valuable resource to the grid. We've seen that\nin PJM. The second point, our markets have worked well to\nincentivize and incorporate storage. And in fact, we are\ncompliant with the FERC Order 841. It was certainly--our\ncompetitive markets have already yielded benefits to incent\ninvestment in battery storage to provide certain grid services.\nAgain, because of our early leadership in this area, we\nhave become the largest market for battery technology that\ncurrently exists. We have 300 megawatts of batteries today that\nparticipate in our market and provide, primarily, frequency\nregulation. We also have 5,000 megawatts of pumped hydro\nstorage and one, of course, 20-megawatt flywheel that's still\noperating in the market.\nIn 2018, 27 percent of the frequency regulation, on\naverage, every hour in our market is provided by battery\nstorage, by storage devices. Effectively, five years ago it was\n100 percent, you know, regular generation. Today, over a\nquarter is provided by these alternative technologies. Very big\nsuccess story. At some times, over 49 percent of the total in\npeak times of the total frequency regulation is provided by\nbattery storage.\nOne of the largest battery deployments in the nation is in\nWest Virginia at Mount Laurel, West Virginia, 32 megawatt\nbatteries co-located with a wind farm. We have about 1,000\nmegawatts of new storage in the transmission interconnection\nqueue. We also have about 2,000 megawatts of combined energy\nstorage in renewables.\nA third point I would make though, is energy storage, at\nthis point, cannot replace traditional generation like nuclear\nor coal-fired, gas-fired power plants, but it can, in fact, and\nhas, competed successfully to provide grid flexibility services\nand very high quality value-added services on the grid.\nObviously, PJM is an independent and fuel neutral\norganization. Our markets have already been adapted. We allow\nparticipation at 100 kilowatts. So we have a tremendous number\nof distributed resources in our system, in fact, 205,000\ndistributed generators already operating in PJM's grid today.\nGenerally, battery storage has limited duration. We have\nseen about 15 minutes, some up to four hours. The technology is\nalways improving. We have already seen, through our markets,\ndemand response has already significantly flattened the peak of\nthe demand on a day-to-day basis. We don't really have those\nsharp peaks anymore because of the advent of these technologies\ncoming in. So we need more and more of these types of\nresources. Aggregation, we believe, is the key to having these\ntypes of resources continue to provide competition in this\narea.\nThere are a variety of policy issues that impact further\nincorporation of energy storage. I'd like to point a few of\nthose out. We certainly need some help from FERC. As usual, I\nam here asking you to help us get some answers out of FERC.\nCertainly, reserve pricing. We put a comprehensive proposal\nin front of FERC to actually price reserves throughout the\nmarket. So this is like a 10-minute reserve, 30-minute reserve,\ntremendous revenue stream potential for battery storage, for\nother types of storage technologies to give a revenue stream.\nBut we really need those rules to be in place and operational.\nWe will have the same kind of success we have seen with\nfrequency regulation.\nSubsidies, again, we will respect the right of Congress and\nthe states to subsidize resource--we need some guidance though\nfrom FERC on how that interplays with competitive investment.\nFederal/state coordination is also something key. We have\nalready seen 2,000 megawatts of distributed resources in our\nsystem, but some help on this notion of how the retail and the\nwholesale interface.\nEnergy storage, again, is a transmission asset, some\nguidance there, as my colleagues on the panel had said.\nAnd finally, again, I think storage does create a\ntremendous opportunity to use alternative technologies to\ndisplace traditional types of resources and clean up, if you\nwill, the grid.\nI look forward to your questions. Thank you very much.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Ott follows:]\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Ott.\nThank you, each of you, this morning for your\ncontributions. I think it is clear we recognize the benefits\nthat energy storage can bring. I think Mr. Fowke, you said,\nthere is no silver bullet out here, but this is clearly a\ncomponent piece, one that adds flexibility, one that gives us\nsome room to run here. And understanding how we have really\nseen a significant increase in energy storage deployment over\nthis past decade here is impressive.\nSeveral of you have mentioned the FERC Order 841. There is\nalso Order 845, designed to improve the interconnection process\nfor energy storage resources.\nMr. Ott, you have outlined some other areas where it would\nbe important to get some guidance or indicators from FERC that\nwould help to clear the regulatory path for energy storage.\nIn addition to what Mr. Ott has outlined, is there anything\nelse that any of you would suggest that FERC needs to look to\nwith regards to regulatory obstacles that are in the path of\nfurther deployment of energy storage?\nI will throw that out to any one of you.\nMr. Kumaraswamy and then Mr. Davidson.\nMr. Kumaraswamy. Sure, I think as I mentioned in my written\nand the oral testimony, the subject of storage as transmission\nneeds to be studied further, I think that maybe structural\ndeficiencies in the way we actually look at that subject.\nIt's an area that we haven't seen much traction overall in\nthe market even though we have had the broader construct of\nOrder 1000 that created the pathway for potentially non-wires\nalternatives to be considered in regional transmission planning\nprocesses.\nWe still haven't seen a lot of success come through from\nthe FERC. And so, I think that may be an area that is\nworthwhile to do a little more exploration. It could be\nfurnishing notice of inquiries or technical conferences with\nthe right subject matter experts to figure out what issues are\nbeing impediments toward deploying storage for transmission and\ndistribution needs.\nThe Chairman. Very good.\nMr. Davidson, did you have anything that you wanted to add\nthere?\nMr. Davidson. Yes, ma'am.\nSenator, I would like to add Brookfield is the single\nlargest private owner of a FERC hydro license. We deal with\nFERC and stakeholders around relicensing our facilities on a\ncontinuous basis. It's arduous.\nHowever, it is well known, it can take upwards of five\nyears to relicense a single facility, but we know how to do it.\nWe do it well and FERC, in the processes now I'd say that it's\nlike any other process, there's always ways to improve. But I'd\nsay that because we know how to do it and we know the way to go\nthrough the process, it works well.\nThe Chairman. Let me keep on with you, Mr. Davidson,\nbecause you mentioned the length of time for the permitting\nprocess, but we also recognize that while pumped hydro storage\nis the most commonly used form of storage, 95 percent, it is\nalso my understanding that these, any new projects, are almost\ncost prohibitive. I am told that on average any new project is\n$1 billion, averages $1 billion, limited to certain geographic\nlocations and certainly take a longer time.\nHow do we get around this hurdle because you have\nregulatory hurdles but you also have economic hurdles?\nMr. Davidson. I think it's more of an economic hurdle right\nnow. I think where the market is today, we don't see the price\nsignals that justify the investment in new pumped storage. So\nthere will have to be some sort of incentives or other ways to\nencourage that type of investment.\nThe Chairman. Well, around this Committee we have been\ntalking a lot about resilience. Mr. Kumaraswamy, you mentioned\nthe importance of storage when it comes to maintaining grid\noperations during natural disasters. Do you think that storage\ntakes on a, perhaps, a more heightened role in these areas,\nthese parts of the country where they are seeing, perhaps, more\ndisaster prone situations where the economic challenges that\nyou speak of, that we have been having a problem with, can get\nthat more clear market signal because we have to have something\nthat stands as that tempering agent, if nothing else?\nMr. Kumaraswamy. Absolutely. No, I think that's a great\nquestion and I want to give you one example that I've\nhighlighted in the written testimony.\nOne of our parent companies, the AES Corporation, actually\nhas two, 10-megawatt energy storage areas that they've deployed\nin the Dominican Republic. If you go back to September 2017\nduring Hurricanes Irma and Maria, you know, Dominican actually\nhad a significant impact from the hurricanes. And we have\nactually seen that the storage arrays provide a significant\namount of frequency control for the island grid, even though\nabout 40 to 50 percent of the traditional generation has been\noffline in the Dominican Republic in the same timeframe.\nSo storage can do that because it is simply the best tool\nthat you have to manage the variations in frequency and it\ntakes a much more important turn when you go into island\naccounts that have limited resources to actually balance the\ngrid and more so during disaster conditions when one or two of\nyour significant generation sources may be offline for a fuel\nreason or for different reasons. And so, that is a great point\nin the sense that the value that storage provides in adding to\nsystem resilience is significant.\nAgain, AES and Siemens have actually provided for a similar\nplan in Puerto Rico where it's a concept of creating mini-grids\nin Puerto Rico where you can have solar and storage co-located\nin a manner that adds significant resilience to Puerto Rico and\nredesigning and reshaping the overall electric grid in a manner\nthat is much, much more resilient than the current\ninfrastructure.\nThe Chairman. Thank you. Thank you, all.\nSenator Manchin.\nSenator Manchin. Thank you, Madam Chairman.\nDr. Crabtree, this might be for you and then anybody else\ncan chime in if they want.\nI understand that a potentially serious obstruction of\ngreater adoption of manufacturing for low carbon-free\ntechnology is going to be reliable access to critical minerals.\nAnd right now, we depend mostly on China for those minerals.\nWith the trade war and the instability that we have, how\ncould this thing escalate? How long it could go on? What type\nof a vulnerable situation are we in in order to proceed further\nin light of a stable domestic supply? We know we have those\nminerals here in America. We just don't do the refining or do\nany of the processing. Do you believe it is of a critical\nnature that we should be moving and acting quickly?\nDr. Crabtree. I think that's an excellent question, Senator\nManchin, and indeed I do believe that it is critical.\nIf you look at what other countries have done, primarily\nChina, they have taken a very strategic and deliberate action\nto line up their supply chains. So they've gone to other\ncountries and written long-term contracts to get lithium, for\nexample, or cobalt.\nThey bring those minerals to China where they're refined\nand then sell them to battery manufacturers, some of which are\nin China, but elsewhere as well.\nThe United States hasn't taken a strategic and deliberate\npoint of view to that challenge. And I think you mentioned that\nthere are minerals in this country that we can certainly\nexploit. We should certainly do that. But we'll need many more\nsources, other than those that are here, and I think we should\nlook at that.\nSenator Manchin. What happens to be some of our\nimpediments? That basically, is cost, you know, us being in a\ncapitalist market and society that when we start down that path\nour costs might be a little bit higher, they will undercut us.\nAnd it pulls the rug out, unless strategically for our country,\nwe strategically have a supply because of the need that we have\nand the security of our nation. And I think, I mean, everything\nthat we do, if you are talking about energy--we have what,\nturbines, lithium batteries, solar cells? Everything depends on\nit. And we do not produce one ounce.\nDr. Crabtree. So the point you raise is extremely valid. It\nwill take some time to remedy.\nI think your point about being in a capitalist society and\nthe cost being higher is a correct one, and we have to find\ncreative and innovative ways to really bring the cost down.\nSenator Manchin. Well, our government, DoD, is part of\nwhere it has to go in order for us to have a strategic supply.\nDr. Crabtree. That's an excellent point. There's a lot of\nthings that can happen in the military that then spill over\ninto the civilian area, for sure.\nAnd may I bring up one more point? And that is that\nrecycling can play a role here. We don't recycle our lithium-\nion batteries at the moment. Less than five percent are\nrecycled. In fact, DOE just started a new program at Argonne\nstarting in February of this year to look at ways to recycle\nlithium-ion. And if we can do that----\nSenator Manchin. Are other countries recycling?\nDr. Crabtree. I'm sorry?\nSenator Manchin. Are other countries recycling? Do you\nknow?\nDr. Crabtree. So far no one in the world has the advantage.\nIt's a level playing field.\nSenator Manchin. No technology for that yet.\nDr. Crabtree. There is no technology for it. So, you can\nsmelt and take the elements off. At Argonne and elsewhere\npeople are looking at what's called direct recycling. That\nmeans taking the cathode out of the used battery as a unit,\nrefurbishing it and putting it back in.\nSenator Manchin. Gotcha.\nDr. Crabtree. This is a way to get the cost down\nconsiderably.\nSenator Manchin. Mr. Ott, if I could, PJM has the largest\namount of demand response in the world, currently making up six\npercent of PJM's total supply. And you have expressed concern\nthat without limits on discharge duration, storage resources\nmay displace these important demand response resources in the\ncapacity market. However, hard critics argue that your proposal\nprevents storage from fully participating in the marketplace.\nWhat are some of the opportunities for storage\nparticipation in PJM beyond the capacity market?\nMr. Ott. Yeah, thank you, Senator.\nIt is key that, certainly, the revenue streams that have\ncreated the significant benefit of, you know, six percent of\nour resources being demand response is displaced probably the\nequivalent of like nine nuclear power plants. I mean, it's a\nsignificant stock.\nThe point though is that at some point the peaks become\nflat and we need to look for alternative ways to use these\nkinds of technologies. Hence, we've put forth a proposal to\nsay, look, there's tremendous opportunity for a 30-minute\nreserve, 10-minute reserve, these other types of very valuable\ngrid resources, backup power as you indicate. If we can pay for\nthem and develop revenue streams for those----\nSenator Manchin. Basically, you want to put those in the\nrecharges.\nMr. Ott. Correct. I want to put those in the market.\nSenator Manchin. We don't want to camouflage it. We want\nthe consumers to pay for that capacity, but you say it will\nsave them in the long run?\nMr. Ott. Essentially what it would do is create a forward\nmarket for these types of valuable reserves and that would\ncreate the revenue stream that's needed for further\ndevelopment. And that's really where we need to be.\nSenator Manchin. What type of a cost increase is that going\nto be to the average retailer?\nMr. Ott. In fact, what we saw with frequency regulation, it\nwas actually a cost decrease because the competition from the\nnew entry was so great that it actually lowered the total price\nover time. So, my opinion is it would be, it would actually be\na savings over time.\nSenator Manchin. Okay, thank you.\nThank you, Madam Chair.\nThe Chairman. Senator Gardner.\nSenator Gardner. Thank you, Madam Chair and thank you to\nthe witnesses for your time and testimony today. Welcome to the\nCommittee.\nI want to compliment Xcel Energy for the work they have\nbeen doing on their 2030 plan, their 2050 plan. Your testimony,\nMr. Fowke, talked a lot about the work that you have been able\nto do to deliver, already, on that vision of both the 2030 as\nyou work toward 2050.\nI agree that storage and a number of other energy\ntechnologies can be developed collaboratively through public\nand private partnerships, investments. And so, I will focus my\nquestions on the federal role in that partnership.\nYou talked about and you called for research and\ndevelopment investments for development of hydrogen and other\npower to gas technologies. Could you talk a little bit more\nabout how hydrogen can play an important role in achieving\nthese, the goals of the Xcel Energy plan, the clean energy\nplan?\nMr. Fowke. Well, thank you, Senator, and thanks for your\nsupport in so many things you do.\nYou know, I know that with today's technologies we can get\nto that interim goal of an 80 percent reduction. It takes the\nright public policy, but we can do it.\nTo get that last 20 percent of carbon out of the big grid,\nand that's what I'm talking about here is the big grid, it's\ngoing to take new technologies. We've talked a lot about the\ndevelopment of storage, but it's going to take, I think also,\ndispatchable resources and it could be in the form of the next\ngeneration of nuclear technology, the next generation of carbon\ncapture or something I probably would have laughed at ten years\nago, the development of the hydrogen economy.\nAnd the opportunity to use electrolysis and renewable\nenergy to fund or to power that electrolysis and produce\nrenewable hydrogen or the opportunity to use high temperature\nsteam and nuclear plants to produce hydrogen, again, carbon-\nfree. I think it's a tremendous opportunity. And then that\nhydrogen could be used in fuel cells or potentially remodified\ngas plants and then you have your dispatchable resource.\nOur approach at Xcel Energy is to be technology agnostic.\nUtilities aren't really designed to do a lot of R&D. And so,\nhere's where the role of the Government, working with industry,\nreally comes into play. And again, thank you for your support.\nSenator Gardner. Thank you very much.\nAs one of the sponsors of the Storage Investment Tax Credit\nbill, along with Senator Heinrich and many other of our\ncolleagues, I am interested in seeing this tax credit spur the\nadoption of additional energy storage and opportunities.\nHow can we ensure that the new tax incentives are\nefficiently used by utility companies and other potential\ninvestors?\nMr. Fowke. Well, that's a really good question. I mean,\nobviously, the incentives have come a long way into getting us\nto where renewables will be our biggest source of energy on our\nsystem by next year. And I think incentives get a lot of credit\nfor that. But, along the way a lot of participants in the\nmarket, including many utilities, don't have the tax appetite\nto efficiently use those tax credits. So, as you know, Senator,\ncomplicated equity partnerships are developed where you\nbasically monetize that through partnership structures. They're\ncomplicated and the participants are fairly limited.\nSo, what does that mean? It means the cost of capital\nraises. And when the cost of capital raises, the renewable\nproject becomes more expensive and ultimately becomes more\nexpensive for the consumer.\nSo, if we can make the utilization of those tax incentives\nmore efficient and have more broader participation, you'd lower\nthat cost of capital. And that's something that we've got some\nideas about and we're working with many of you on the\nCommittee.\nSenator Gardner. Thank you. I look forward to continuing\nour work together on that so we can actually utilize the tools\nthat we have. It is pretty exciting.\nMr. Kumaraswamy, a question for you regarding some of the\nenergy storage work you talked about. I was impressed with the\nnumbers that you testified in your opening statement about\nestimates for market growth that your company and others in the\nstorage industry will need to grow to meet that demand. Pretty\nimpressive.\nI am hearing that there are supply chain issues though and\nsome concerns about those challenges, particularly related to\nsome of the news that have been recently highlighted by the\nPeople's Daily, the ruling Communist Party newspaper in China.\nThey ran a commentary last week headlined, ``United States\ndon't underestimate China's ability to strike back.'' It noted\nthat the United States is uncomfortably dependent on rare\nearths from China. The editorial included this line, ``Will\nrare earths become a counter weapon for China to hit back\nagainst the pressure of the United States has put on for no\nreason at all? The answer is no mystery.''\nHow do companies like yours and others deal with the\ncritical mineral supply chain challenges such as rare earths,\ngraphite, cobalt, nickel and others?\nMr. Kumaraswamy. That's a great question, Senator.\nFluence is a technology agnostic company, so we actually\ndon't manufacture batteries, we don't manufacture rotors. We\nhave the technology platform that we offer for the customers\nand we design these solutions in a manner where they can\nbenefit in terms of the performance from those systems and\nminimizing the total lifetime cost of all of those solutions.\nAnd so, what we end up doing is actually working with a broad\narray of suppliers globally to source many of these components.\nAnd so, I think it protects us and shields us from particular\nexposure in a particular area or a particular region of\ngeography and that gives us the capability to continue to serve\nour customers globally with the supply chain that we have. So--\n--\nSenator Gardner. Just quickly.\nDo companies, storage companies, generally manufacture\ntheir own cells, modules, battery packs that integrate the\nsystem or do they source most of these from Chinese battery\ncells and modules?\nMr. Kumaraswamy. There are companies that actually do that,\nbut there's also a robust supply chain that is non-China based\nthat's actually available in the marketplace as well.\nSenator Gardner. Very good, thank you.\nThank you, Madam Chair.\nThe Chairman. Senator Heinrich.\nSenator Heinrich. Dr. Crabtree, I want to ask you a little\nbit about the nexus between storage and carbon pollution,\nbecause one of the things we are trying to get at here,\nobviously, is to address our climate challenges, and storage\ncan obviously play a role in reducing those emissions, but used\nin certain ways it can also increase those emissions.\nHas JCESR or have you given thought to what policies or\nmarket structures might be needed to ensure that as we bring\nstorage on to the grid we are actually having the impact of\ncleaning the grid up?\nDr. Crabtree. That is a great question, Senator Heinrich.\nI think one of the most important things is that we charge\nthe storage that we put on the grid with clean electricity. So\nif we're charging with fossil electricity, we're basically\nencouraging the greater use of fossil electricity.\nAnd I think the ways that we can find, either through\npolicy or incentives at the state level and at the federal\nlevel, to encourage that simple activity is the most important\nthing that we can do.\nSenator Heinrich. Great. I appreciate that.\nMr. Ott, as you are aware, Section 204 of the Federal Power\nAct bars any utility practice that is unjust, unreasonable,\nunduly discriminatory or preferential. And as you know, I have\nbeen closely following FERC's implementation of Order 841. You\nsaid you were compliant with Order 841.\nBut let me ask, in PJM's filings, can you, I guess, explain\nto us how putting in place a 10-hour minimum capacity\nrequirement for storage is not on its face unduly discretionary\nor preferential, and could that potentially actually make PJM\nnon-compliant with FERC's Order 841?\nMr. Ott. Thank you, Senator.\nI believe the key here is that we're treating all resources\nthe same for providing the same service. And again, I believe\nfrom a capacity perspective, allowing aggregation, allowing\nresources to come together to meet the requirement is a way\nthat will create a platform, if you will, for resources that\ncurrently can't meet duration requirements to actually, I'll\nsay, participate with others. So, there are ways to get there.\nIt's not a barring.\nSenator Heinrich. How did you arrive at that figure, 10-\nhours?\nMr. Ott. It's based on the duration of our peaks given the\ntremendous amount of demand response we have in our system.\nSenator Heinrich. Mr. Davidson, I want to ask you a little\nbit about the historical role of hydropower versus what we may\nneed today and whether or not the structures are there to\nincentivize the role of hydropower in the future as a grid\nbalancer.\nHistorically most hydropower has been used for firm\ncapacity. Obviously, we see an enormous role going into the\nfuture of what you discussed in your testimony of using\nhydropower as a grid balancer.\nBut are there changes that need to be made at the state and\nfederal levels in policy or in market structures to encourage\nits use in that role?\nMr. Davidson. Yes, Senator, thank you for the question.\nThe simple answer is yes. Today, hydropower and pumped\nhydro, in particular, is taking on the job of trying to help\nmitigate intermittent resources as it comes on during different\nperiods of the day and move that energy during periods when it\nis most needed. As we continue to integrate even more of these\nintermittent resources into the system, this need will become\neven greater.\nThe economic signals that are out in the market today do\nnot justify the extensive----\nSenator Heinrich. They are not adequate to----\nMr. Davidson. No, sir. They're not adequate for the amount\nof investment you have to make in pumped-storage.\nThe one thing you do have to remember though, is when you\nbuild a pumped-storage facility, this is a 100-year life asset.\nSenator Heinrich. Sure.\nMr. Davidson. Many parts of it, the mechanical parts of it,\nare 30 to 50 years, but the actual infrastructure, the pieces,\nthe parts of it we build inside of mountains, they're there,\nbasically forever. So we have to think of these assets are\nforever assets.\nSenator Heinrich. Mr. Kumaraswamy, I want to get your\nthoughts on how important--well, a couple of years ago we heard\na lot about value stacking. How important is that today and how\nshould state and federal market rules be crafted to reflect the\nincremental value and the revenue streams from different types\nof services that storage can provide and potentially provide\nconcurrently?\nMr. Kumaraswamy. That's a great question, Senator Heinrich,\nand thank you so much for your leadership on many of the\nstorage-related bills that you've sponsored or you've supported\nover the years and currently.\nOn the value stacking we always say that you can make the\nbusiness case work with two or three different services that\nare provided in the marketplace. So, in many, many markets\nacross the U.S. what we are finding is that four hours of\nenergy storage is enough to get even 90 percent or 100 percent\nof capacity current. And so, having the capacity value come\nthrough from the regional markets is a significant plus. And\nthen you add the capability for energy storage to provide that\npeaking capacity and frequency relations simultaneously and\nthat lets you do two of those services at once. And many\nmarkets, again, just doing those two things alone will get you\nover the finish line and that's partly enabled because of the\nfalling cost of energy storage over time also, right?\nSo I think we have noted that previously in the opening\nremarks here in this hearing. Energy storage costs have fallen\nsignificantly in the last several years. And as far as we can\nsee, that trend is going to continue, not because of anything\nthat we do in the energy sector, but everything that happens in\nthe transportation sector.\nAnd so, whatever is happening on the EV side of the house\nis really creating that synergy right now that the stationary\nenergy storage market can take advantage of and right on top of\nthat and take advantage of this amazing technology that we\nhave.\nSo I think in answer to your question, I would say doing\ncapacity and some of the ancillary services really is essential\nto crossing the line in many of the markets.\nThe Chairman. Senator Stabenow.\nSenator Stabenow. Thank you, Madam Chair, for another\nexcellent hearing on such a critical topic for all of us. When\nI hear about the things happening in American innovation,\nthanks to all of you, it just reminds me over and over again if\nwe could just really focus and get past debating whether or not\nclimate change is real and focus on what we can do about it,\nthere is a lot that we can and have to do about it. I\nappreciate the Committee's thoughtfulness in lifting these\nthings up because there is an incredible sense of urgency as we\nwatch the severe weather and past disaster assistance bills\nover and over again. Thank you for all that you are doing.\nParticularly, Dr. Crabtree, I want to ask you a couple\nquestions as Director of the Joint Center for Energy Storage\nResearch. I am very pleased the University of Michigan is a key\npartner in that. I hear a lot about what you are doing from\nthem, and I know that they play an integral role in research to\nadvance solid-state batteries.\nAs a state focused on transportation, this is obviously of\ngreat interest to me. I understand this technology can\nsignificantly reduce EV charging times which is going to be\nessential as we deploy more and more electric vehicles, and\nsome are saying to as little as 10 minutes which would be\nfantastic and increase the storage capacity in smaller, simpler\nbattery packs which is also very important. I am wondering how\nclose are we to widespread commercial deployment of this kind\nof battery technology and what are the challenges to not only\ngetting to commercialization but also production of solid-state\nbatteries in the United States?\nDr. Crabtree. That's a wonderful question and thank you,\nSenator Stabenow, for your support. We very much appreciate the\nUniversity of Michigan who does play a big role both on the\ntransportation side and for the solid-state electrolytes that\nyou mentioned.\nSenator Stabenow. Yes.\nDr. Crabtree. I was at a conference last year of early\ncareer battery researchers. There were about 60 of them. And\nthey took a survey and said what do you think is the most\nimportant or impactful development that is on the horizon and\nthe number one answer was solid-state electrolytes.\nSo I feel, personally, that this is something that will\nhappen. We've used liquid organic electrolytes for lithium-ion\nbatteries since their inception in 1991, but so far have not\nbeen able to improve on that.\nOne of the things that solid-state electrolytes would do is\ndramatically improve the safety of batteries. There's the\nthermal runaway reaction, which is the problem that Boeing ran\ninto a few years ago and we all know about, occurs. It's a\nreaction between the liquid organic electrolyte and the\ncathode. So with the solid-state electrolyte, that side\nreaction is gone and suddenly the safety is much greater.\nYou asked to how close are we to that? So the problem, the\nbig technical challenge, is how fast lithium-ions move in the\nsolid-state electrolyte. And most solid-state electrolytes,\nthey move quite slowly which means the charging time would be\nslow.\nThere are two classes of materials where they move actually\nfaster than in liquid organic electrolytes and those two\nclasses of materials are getting enormous attention right now.\nSo I would say that it's quite promising that this will happen.\nMany others as well as myself, feel that it's very likely to\nhappen in the laboratory probably within the next five years\nand then you face probably another five years of scaling it up\nand bringing it to production. So my guess, and I may be\nconservative in this, is that it's probably about ten years\naway.\nSenator Stabenow. Well, we need to figure something out\nbecause we need to be moving. I appreciate all your work. We\nneed to be moving as quickly as possible on this.\nI also appreciate your testimony on the benefits of\nelectric vehicles and in your written testimony you said, ``EVs\nunite the two largest energy users in the economy, the electric\ngrid and transportation and create a new horizon on the\nelectric grid.''\nBoth Senator Alexander and I have introduced a bill to\nextend the federal tax credits we need to be able to do that to\nbe able to get more vehicles in the marketplace to be able to\nbring, sufficiently bring, the price down because of volume,\nbut we also need the charging stations. This is a catch-22 in\nterms of being able to quickly move forward on that.\nI wonder if you could speak just a little bit more about\nharnessing the energy potential of vehicle batteries for grid\nservices during and after the life of the vehicle. I think the\nafterlife, the recycling piece is very, very important.\nResearch suggests, as you know, that retired lithium-ion\nvehicle batteries have as much as 70 percent of their initial\nstorage capacity and potential for discharge of electricity for\nanother seven to ten years in less demanding uses.\nYou briefly mentioned it. You mentioned the Department of\nDefense. But I am wondering what your feeling is in terms of\nbeing able to move more quickly on recycling of those\nbatteries?\nDr. Crabtree. So I think this is universally recognized,\nthat recycling is universally recognized as something that's\ntimely and needs to happen badly, partly because EVs will drive\nthe demand for lithium-ion batteries enormously up and we need\nto look for our supply chain, as Senator Manchin was mentioning\nearlier, and also the cost.\nSo, for example, if you take a lithium-ion battery out of a\ncar when it still has 70 percent of its capacity left and put\nit into the grid, basically cutting the cost by a factor of two\nfor each of those applications because the battery is now being\nused twice.\nAt the end of its usefulness for the grid, of course, we\nhave to recycle. And my feeling is that within the next five\nyears with the new emphasis on recycling, that we will find\nways to recycle at lower cost and make use of all of the\nelements, particularly lithium, nickel and cobalt that are in\nused batteries.\nYou may know that lead acid batteries are 99 percent\nrecycled. It's actually cheaper to get lead from an old lead\nacid battery than it is to mine it out of the ground, and we'd\nlike to reach that state for lithium-ion as well.\nSenator Stabenow. Thank you.\nI have other questions that I will submit for the record,\nMadam Chair.\nThank you to each of you.\nThe Chairman. Thank you.\nSenator Hirono.\nSenator Hirono. Thank you, Madam Chair, for continuing to\nfocus on the need to reduce emissions from the use of fossil\nfuels.\nI have a lead up to a question for you, Mr. Fowke. Hawaii\nis on the leading edge of incorporating renewable power and\nenergy storage. And of course, Hawaii is not connected to any\nother states' grids, so we are kind of on our own.\nI visited the Hawaii solar and storage facility on Kauai\nisland in Hawaii in April. It is the largest combined solar and\nbattery storage facility in the world. It generates 11 percent\nof Kauai's power and can serve as much as 40 percent of Kauai's\nevening peak power demand. All together Kauai Island Utility\nCooperative gets 50 percent of its power from renewable sources\nand it expects to reach 60 percent renewable power by the end\nof this year with another combined solar and battery storage\nsystem at Pacific missile range facility, Barking Sands Naval\nBase.\nHawaiian Electric--which is the largest utility in the\nstate and before Kauai Utility Co-op came along, it was the\nonly utility in the state--recently received approval for six\nnew solar and storage projects to provide 247 megawatts of\nsolar energy with almost 800 megawatt-hours of storage, enough\nto power 105,000 homes per year while eliminating the use of\nmore than 48 million gallons of imported fossil fuel.\nHawaii was the most imported fossil fuel dependent state in\nthe country and we had probably the highest electricity rates\nin the country, possibly with the exception of Alaska.\nSo the company is preparing a second round of bids for even\nmore solar and storage to replace fossil fuel plants, and there\nwill be even more innovation in the future to meet Hawaii's\ngoal of 100 percent renewable power by 2045.\nFrom a utility's perspective, what are the challenges of\noperating a system with technology solutions that do not have a\nlong history of commercial use and do you think it is important\nfor the Federal Government to reduce the risk of adopting early\nstage technologies? I recognize that research is really\nimportant, but then we really need to figure out how to deploy\nthese technologies in a way that is meaningful. What are your\nthoughts about the Federal Government's role in the deployment\nside of things?\nMr. Fowke. Well, Senator, thanks for the question.\nYou're absolutely right. Regulated utilities really aren't\ndesigned to do a lot of research because their obligation is to\npick the most economically efficient resources and put them on\nthe grid. And if there's other economic signals, the price of\ncarbon, et cetera, we factor that into that but experimenting\nin a large-scale, outside of pilot programs, is difficult. So\nthat's where the Federal Government, I think, comes in to do\nthe research, provide the incentives to make that more\naffordable so they can be implemented.\nYou know, your concept, you talked about the Hawaiian\nislands being an island, I think that's very important because\nI think what we need to focus on is take that concept as we\nlook for adding as much renewable onto the big grid, the\nisland, if you will, as we possibly can. And depending upon\nwhat your substitute is and in the case of imported fossil\nfuels, it's a pretty high cost, as you know.\nSo we've had a program called Steel for Fuel where\nliterally the steel is the renewables and what we're displacing\nis the fuel. And it turns out that the cost of the fuel that\nyou save covers, and then some, the cost of the steel.\nThat's exactly what, I think, Hawaii is doing. And I think\nyou'll find that you can have on that island or the big grid,\nif we were here in the Continental U.S., you'll probably be\nable to get to that 60 percent, maybe even more. But there does\ncome a saturation point on the big grid.\nBack to your question about reliability where we're going\nto need storage and we're going to need dispatchable resources,\nI believe. And perhaps they come from biofuels, perhaps they\ncome from hydrogen, geothermal. There's a number of different\nthings, and I think we need to be technology agnostic about it.\nSo my point is we'll put as much renewables as we can\nreliably and affordably do on the grid or the island, then you\nneed to look for these other technologies and the research that\nwill help us make those technologies viable, is the role, I\nthink, the Federal Government plays.\nSenator Hirono. Well, not just in support for research\nthough, but we need support for, you know, there are these new\ntechnologies being developed for storage, et cetera, but we are\ngoing to need some help in how to implement or to put in place\nthese innovations and that is where, maybe, the Federal\nGovernment has a larger role to play in addition to supporting\nthe research aspects.\nMr. Fowke. I would agree with that. I also would agree\nthat's where your utility can play a big role too. We do a very\ngood job of starting small and then scaling up to speed of\nvalue.\nSenator Hirono. Yes. Thank you.\nI do have further questions for the record that I will\nsubmit.\nThank you very much.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator Hirono.\nSenator King.\nSenator King. Thank you.\nMr. Fowke, just to follow up. Isn't storage and demand\nresponse dispatchable? I mean, you turn it on, it comes into\nthe system. You seem to imply that it has to be a gas plant or\nsomething.\nMr. Fowke. So I'd answer that yes and no and let me\nexplain, if I could. There are things that the dispatchable\nresources do that bring attributes to grid health that you're\nnot going to necessarily get from renewables. But the biggest\nissue----\nSenator King. I am not talking about renewables, I am\ntalking about batteries and demand response.\nMr. Fowke. That's correct and they----\nSenator King. Those are dispatchable.\nMr. Fowke. They can play a role with that.\nSenator King. Okay.\nMr. Fowke. The bigger aspect is if you think about a\nmountaintop, it's a lot easier to shave the peak off the\nmountain than it is as you work down that mountain. That first\n4 hours, once you shave that peak, now you're looking at trying\nto get at 8 hours. And if you think of that mountain, it's\nflattened out and it's wider.\nSenator King. I understand.\nMr. Fowke. And you start to need a lot more batteries and a\nlot more demand response and as you work down the mountain it\njust comes all the more----\nSenator King. I do understand that, but I just wanted to\nmake the point that we are talking about a dispatchable\nresource.\nMr. Fowke. Yes, frequency regulation, all the things that\nmy colleagues talked about, that's where batteries can play a\nbig role.\nSenator King. Mr. Crabtree, just for your information and\nthe information of our friends that are here--I am working on a\nbill that involves a joint venture between the Department of\nEnergy and Department of Defense.\nCarrying fuel is a big risk for our troops. I think that\nthere is a relationship, a joint venture, as I say, and also a\nbill that will discuss the issue of how to properly value those\nresources.\nI am asking for your cooperation and assistance in the\ncreation of that bill. If there are members here with a lot of\nknowledge in this audience, please be in touch with my office\nas we try to put this bill together. I look forward to your\nsuggestions.\nAs I listen to this discussion, we talk about value and,\nMr. Davidson, you talked about how pumped-storage and batteries\nare somewhat the same. They are high capital cost but low\noperating cost. And yet, as I have seen the development of\nenergy pricing and markets and all of that, it favors low\ncapital cost. I guess what I am getting at is, don't we need\nlong-term contracts in order to help develop these capital-\nintensive applications?\nMr. Davidson. Senator, yes, I think that's exactly what we\ndo need or some other type of incentive that would encourage\nthat large capital investment.\nSenator King. I used to be in the hydro business and if you\ncould not have a 15-year contract, you could not have gotten\nfinancing.\nMr. Davidson. Right.\nSenator King. Because you have a high capital cost that has\nto be amortized as opposed to just a day-to-day operating cost.\nMr. Ott, is that correct?\nMr. Ott. Yes, well, that's the key. And I think one of the\ndebates around the capacity market revenue for storage is it's\nthe only long-term market we have.\nSo one other alternative to long-term contract is to have\nlonger-term markets for these grid services like, you know,\nlike we see on some of the exchanges for energy. So there's\nother alternatives.\nSenator King. But that is something that we have to be\ntalking about because otherwise the financing drives everything\ntoward, you know, low capital costs, toward natural gas plants\nthat are cheap to build and can be moderately too expensive to\noperate.\nRegulatory hurdles, interconnection delays and those kinds\nof things--talk to me, Mr. Ott, about what the regulatory\nissues are in getting these things permitted and online, and\nare there significant delays? Is that something we can help\nwith?\nMr. Ott. Generally, I think, the volume, the volume of\ninterconnections coming in with these distributed resources.\nLike I'd mentioned, we have, you know, a couple 100,000 of\nthem.\nI think the real key is for us to streamline, if you will,\nfor the small stuff. We don't have to go through the same, you\nknow, I'll say, engineering that we would for a bigger\ngenerator. And I think how streamlining, how we approach that\nand getting FERC to agree to that is probably a way to lower\nbarriers even further than they are today.\nSo those kind of things----\nSenator King. So I understand interconnection on some of\nthese can take more than a year, a lot of work.\nMr. Kumaraswamy, do you have thoughts on this regulatory\nside?\nMr. Kumaraswamy. Yeah, no, I think that's a good point. I\nthink I may have touched on the point briefly also.\nIf you think about energy storage, things are highly\nprecise and controllable resources. So they're very different\nfrom a traditional gas-based generation resource.\nAnd so, I think you have to think about it from that lens\nof how do you study the interconnection in a manner that's fast\nenough that can let this resource come online and start\nproviding services in a matter of like six or eight months and\nnot let the interconnection process be the choking point for a\nresource that can deployed in a matter of months. Right? And\nso, that's where, I think, there needs to be a little more\nthinking in terms of the process that you would adapt for, you\nknow, a resource like that which is highly controllable.\nSenator King. Mr. Ott, you mentioned several times the\nimportance of frequency regulation as an asset. Does that have\na price? Does that have a value in the current market?\nMr. Ott. Absolutely. It has a tremendous value, that's why\nwe've gotten the response from having 300 megawatts of\nbatteries invested on market so it's completely competitive. So\nyes, it absolutely has high value.\nSenator King. So it is a capacity payment. There is a\nfrequency, right?\nMr. Ott. Synchronized reserves, frequency capacity, so\nthere's multiple revenue streams that these resources--the only\none that has a forward component to it though is capacity which\nis why it's controversial. My point is, I think we can make\nsome of these other markets have forward components that get\nmore----\nSenator King. Well, my understanding is that some of the\nregional RTOs are talking about devaluing batteries to 70\npercent versus 100 percent for other devaluing the capacity\nestimates. Have you encountered that?\nMr. Ott. That's for the long duration stuff.\nSenator King. Right.\nMr. Ott. But my point is, is that I think you can\naccentuate the value and frequency regulation of these other\nshort-term services. So I think there's a counter balance\nthere.\nSenator King. We have talked now mostly about grid-scale. I\nam way over time, I am sorry. But I would like to hear perhaps\nfor the record about distributed storage, not grid-scale\nnecessarily, but grid-scale in the aggregate, households, other\nkinds of distributed storage. I think that is an important part\nof this aspect, of this, that we haven't talked about.\nThank you, Madam Chair.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator King.\nSenator Barrasso.\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you, Madam Chairman. I thank you\nand thank the Ranking Member for holding this important hearing\nthis morning.\nWhile we are working to advance low-carbon technology\nthrough innovation in carbon capture technology systems,\nadvancement in energy storage in that arena is really important\nin terms of integrating the low-carbon sources on to the grid.\nSo we have discussed today one of the main challenges with\nintegrating renewable energy sources into the grid is the\nintermittent nature of these sources. Baseload energy sources,\ncoal, natural gas is going to continue to play an important\nrole in providing low cost, reliable and onsite energy\nsolutions into the future.\nIn February of this year the Committee held an important\nhearing on cybersecurity efforts in the energy industry. I know\nwe are still in the process of researching and developing grid-\nscale energy storage technologies but, I think it is from the\nstandpoint that one of the books on Bill Gates' recent reading\nlist was called, ``The Grid,'' about how it was formed and\nwhere we are today.\nThe question for any of the witnesses is, as we consider\nways to improve security throughout the electricity grid, how\nare we planning to protect storage facilities?\nMr. Ott. So effectively, as you look at creating, I'll say,\nresilience, diversity, et cetera, really, it's through, not\ndepending on one type of resource, or not depending on any one\nkind of technology. It's really promoting diversity, if you\nwill. I think the real answer to resilience is to have more\nthan, not all your eggs in one basket and have more\nalternatives. And I think that's really the same approach we\ntake for storage.\nSenator Barrasso. Anyone else? Yes, sir, Doctor?\nDr. Crabtree. If I could comment, I think it's a great\nquestion and picking up on what we just heard. Diversity is\nvery important and flexibility. So if you add storage to the\ngrid suddenly there's more than one or more than two or more\nthan three ways to provide power in the event of an outage, be\nit a cybersecurity one or a weather outage. And that is a huge\nadvantage.\nSo I would couple that with one more comment and that is\ndecentralization is important. So when things are centralized\nthen the central power plant goes out and the whole system goes\nout. When it's decentralized, through microgrids or on the\ndistribution grid, it's much safer against every kind of\noutage. So I think this is one of the ways in which we can\nprotect the storage.\nSenator Barrasso. And beyond the outage standpoint is the\nissue of the range that we are seeing in terms of energy needs.\nWe have had a number of extreme weather events, major cold\nsnaps, tornadoes, flooding, hurricanes, each presents specific\nchallenges to electricity providers, to the grid\ninfrastructure. It is foreseeable that a disaster could damage\nor eliminate an energy storage facility too, so baseload energy\nsources like coal, natural gas, to me are needed in this in\nevery instance.\nHow can we continue to ensure that affordable, reliable,\neasily dispatched energy sources like coal and gas remain part\nof the electricity generation mix? Anyone? Yes, Mr. Ott?\nMr. Ott. Again, I think it's key to equitably value the\ncontribution. We've had a debate about should we pay, you know,\n15-minute battery capacity payments that are generally suited\nfor nuclear plants, coal plants, gas plants. My answer is no.\nThere's other kind of revenue streams that they fit better for.\nSo I think it's really just to make sure that from an\ninfrastructure planning perspective, we recognize the value of\nthese baseload assets and make sure we have the markets\nrecognize those values.\nSenator Barrasso. Since you mention planning for the\nfuture, thousands more electric vehicles are expected to come\nonline in the near future. We have seen the commercial during\nthe Super Bowl from one of the car companies about what high\npercentage of their new sales will be of electric vehicles. To\nme, that is going to add a new major demand to the grid.\nRecent studies showed electricity consumption in the United\nStates could increase as much as 38 percent by the year 2050 as\nmore and more electric vehicles hit the market. So, for anyone,\ndo you believe we are going to be able to develop the energy\nstorage technologies in time to meet this incredible\nelectricity demand increase?\nMr. Fowke. Senator, I think that's a really good question.\nI think it's yes, you need to develop the infrastructure,\nbut I think the requirements to develop that infrastructure can\nbe minimized if we put in the right incentives through rate\ndesign to encourage off peak charging.\nAnd that's something we're piloting at Xcel Energy, and\nit's working very nicely. And that requires state regulators to\nbe more flexible than perhaps, you know, traditionally one-\nsize-fits-all have said.\nAnd I also would tell you that I'm proud to say the\nelectric utility industry is not the number one carbon emitter\nin the United States anymore. It's transport. And the\nopportunities for EVs from an economic transition, I think, is\nreally quite promising. In fact, if you charge up your car\ntoday it's a $1 equivalent of gasoline--so with a 70 percent\ncarbon emission reduction. I think we've got some real\nopportunities there. The infrastructure, I think, can follow\nthat.\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you.\nThank you, Madam Chairman.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator Barrasso.\nSenator Cortez Masto.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you. Thank you very much, Madam\nChair.\nI do want to follow up on some of the conversation that\nSenator King and some of the others had that I have heard with\nrespect to highlighting the role that distributed and\nresidential storage has increasingly played, particularly as I\nsee it in the State of Nevada as well.\nI know that these technologies provide unique benefits that\ngrid-scale cannot provide such as local reliability and\nresiliency. In fact, residential storage installation in the\nU.S. has increased more than 200 percent annually during the\npast four years.\nI guess my question to the panel is, what are the\nchallenges to implementing more expansive deployment of\nresidential storage units, having them implemented at an\nindividual residence, but also putting them to greater use\nwithin a greater network? I am curious about the conversation\nthere. Then along with that conversation, what can we do as the\nFederal Government to also continue to support and incentivize\nresidential storage?\nDr. Crabtree. May I comment on that?\nSenator Cortez Masto. Please.\nDr. Crabtree. I think it's a very good point that behind-\nthe-meter storage or distribution grid storage has a huge role\nto play. I would say certainly at the residential level it's\nvery important. It might be even more important at the\nneighborhood level.\nSo you could imagine an aggregator coming to a neighborhood\nof homes and saying I'll put a solar panel on every roof in\nthis neighborhood. I'll pay for it. I'll buy a battery that's\nsized to the neighborhood. I'll pay for it. I will put in an\nenergy management system that will direct all of that rooftop\nsolar to the neighborhood at the time and place that it's\nneeded. For example, I'll charge your electric vehicles at\nnight and this will relieve demands on the grid. And I'll do it\nat a lower cost than you are now paying as a ratepayer, because\nwe're producing that rooftop solar that we're using locally.\nSo, I think one of the, you said, what can we do? We can\nencourage that kind of innovation. At the moment that field is\nwide open and aggregators have not stepped in to take advantage\nof the opportunity, partly because, maybe, it's risky and\npartly because it hasn't been encouraged. So I think there are\nhuge opportunities there.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Yes, and I would say it is on the\ndrawing board. I have talked to some of our rural co-ops who\nare interested in doing just that.\nI guess my question is what more can we do to incentivize\nit and ensure that it becomes more than just on the drawing\nboard and they have the ability to actually put this into\naction?\nMr. Kumaraswamy. I would say that one of the ways in which\nenergy storage provides for some of these other benefits to the\nmarket typically doesn't value, right? There's a lot of\nbenefits that storage brings to the table, including the\nresilience ones that was talked about previously and in many\ncases what we find is that either in a structured market, in a\nwholesale market structure or in a traditionally regulated\nstructure. You can at least find it hard to value these types\nof benefits.\nAnd so, one way of, you know, getting through that puzzle\nis to make sure that you have the Section 48 and 25D of the\ninvestment tax credit be applicable for standard owner energy\nstorage devices, right? We think of it as an incentive to\nbetter recognize the value that storage provides that are not\nbeing captured in the wholesale markets or in some of the\nstructured markets. That's one.\nI think the second one, honestly, is that we are moving\ninto a place where we have to be extremely prudent about\nincurring capital costs on single use assets, right? So any\ncapital asset, whether it's a natural gas peaking plant or a\nlarge transmission distribution line, we have to be extremely\nprudent before we incur an expenditure and put the burden on\nratepayers for the next 20, 30 years, right?\nAnd so, I think that's where the collection of whether it's\ngrid-scale storage or the combination of resources which\ninclude demand response or behind-the-meter storage, all of\nthem come into play where you look at a portfolio of these\nsolutions that can potentially take away the need for you to\nincur large amount of capital expenditures that are\nfractionally utilized for a significantly long period of time.\nThat's what we want to avoid.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Anyone else?\nMr. Fowke. I think all of that is valid but I will have to\ntake, Senator, a little bit of a contrast. Scale really matters\nin our business, and so I would say that the underlying\ntechnologies just need to come down in price so at some point,\nyou know, the delta between large and small isn't as pronounced\nas it is.\nAnd of course, the debate about some regulatory policies\nthat were put into place to encourage that nascent technology\nneed to be revisited and that's not without controversy. But\nwhat we need to do, what I am trying to do as the CEO of a\nlarge utility, is achieve that 100 percent carbon-free goal,\nkeep my prices affordable for everyone and reliable.\nSo I'm very much focused on avoiding cost shifts because\nthat tends to cloud the economic signal that, I think, we all\nneed to be looking at to achieve that goal. And so, as we\nadvance the technologies, as they make this more possible, we\ndo have to be willing to go back and revisit older policies\nthat were good at their time but maybe have lived past their\nprime.\nSenator Cortez Masto. Thank you.\nI noticed my time is up.\nThe only other question, and I will submit it for the\nrecord, is the workforce. What is the workforce that we need\nfor the discussion that we had here today? And I will submit\nthat for the record.\nThank you.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator.\nWell, Senator, I will make it easier for you. I will ask\nthat question because that is something that I, too, am curious\nabout where when I just came from a speech earlier this morning\nabout the future of nuclear and you cannot talk about the\nfuture of nuclear in this country unless you talk about a\nskilled workforce. Is this an area where we need to be doing\nmore to be able to address the growing demand? Doctor?\nDr. Crabtree. May I comment?\nGreat point and I think when you look at the workforce and\nyou look at what's happening to the grid, everything we do\nabout electricity and the electricity grid is domestic. So when\nwe talk about a 30 percent increase in demand from EVs, those\nare domestic jobs and domestic infrastructure that we need to\nbuild.\nSo training that workforce, I think, is critical. There\nwill be some dislocations from technologies that, let's say,\nare no longer as relevant as they used to be. We can make up\nfor those, some of those, dislocations by retraining or\ntraining the next generation to do what's needed. I believe\nthat it's a huge opportunity that we should embrace.\nThe Chairman. Good.\nLet me ask you, Mr. Fowke, a question about your goals\nhere, 80 percent carbon-free in your service territory by 2030,\n100 percent by 2050. You have not really outlined what Xcel is\ndoing, specifically which technologies you are moving to.\nIs it a fair statement to say that you could not achieve\nthese ambitious goals, recognizing we don't have federal\nmandate out there, but as a business decision, you could not\nachieve these goals without greater application of energy\nstorage?\nMr. Fowke. I think that's a fair statement. It really will\ndepend on what other technologies, Senator, become economically\nviable.\nI know that if we don't make it affordable and if we\nsacrifice reliability, the clean energy transition is going to\ntake a major setback.\nSo today with the prices I've seen over, just the last 10\nyears, really the last 3 years, in wind and solar, I can do\nthis with economics in mind. I have to have reliability.\nSo whether that is today, the implementation of storage as\nmuch as we can until we start to go down that cost curve that I\nmentioned or peaking gas generation, that, the economics is\nwhat I'm after. And again, I know how to get to that 80\npercent, the next 20 percent is going to take some of these\nother technologies, advances and long duration storage.\nAnd again, I think, dispatchable generation, and we talked\nabout many of the different ways that could be--hydrogen,\ncarbon capture, next generation nuclear.\nThe Chairman. One last question for me, and then I will\nturn to Senator King and Cortez Masto, if they have more.\nBut in their budget request for this fiscal year, DOE has\nproposed the Advanced Energy Storage Initiative. This is a $158\nmillion cross-cutting program that establishes goals for cost\ncompetitive energy storage. Your free advice here on how and\nwhere the Department should focus its research and development\nefforts as they are looking to reduce the cost of energy\nstorage technologies. What would you have them do? Dr.\nCrabtree?\nDr. Crabtree. Yeah, thank you, that's a great question.\nI believe that up until this point the way we've treated\nstorage and to a certain extent, the grid, is a little bit too\npiecemeal that one needs to look strategically and holistically\nat the whole system and look for the next 20 or 30 years which\nis how long it will take to make this transition to a fully\nmodern grid, that we ought to deliberately take steps that will\nproduce the outcomes that we wish to have rather than letting\nthe market give us what, you know, what it would produce by\nitself.\nSo I think we need, sort of, an energy storage and grid\necosystem to look at. This DOE proposal is one step along that\nroute but we ought to have a very serious look at strategically\nwhere are we going and how are we going to get there.\nThe Chairman. Any other advice?\nMr. Kumaraswamy.\nMr. Kumaraswamy. Sure, that's a great question also.\nI think I noted in my testimony that the National Renewable\nEnergy Labs have been a significant source of research on\nstudying the capacity value that energy storage brings and,\nquite honestly, they have, given the body of literature that we\nneed for us to be successful in many of the efforts that we\nneed across the regional power markets.\nAnd so I think I would say that that's one area that needs\nto continue in terms of making sure that we better get a handle\non what is the amount of duration of storage that we need to\ncapture the full capacity value? Is it four hours? Is it six\nhours? Is it eight hours or is it ten hours, right? And so,\nwhat fraction of duration would you need to capture what\npercentage of capacity value?\nAnd that research needs to continue, and then the second\none that we are still gaining very nascent stages of\nexploration is this use of energy storage for solving some of\nthe transmission needs that we have on the grid side, right? So\nhow can you use these fast-acting energy storage devices to\nprovide for solving congestion issues on the transmission\nsystem, right? How can we better utilize the existing\ntransmission system that we already have in a more efficient\nmanner? Are there ways to think about those applications of\nstorage? Those are key areas that would significantly benefit\nby, you know, research by the national labs.\nThe Chairman. Very good, thank you.\nSenator King.\nSenator King. Thank you.\nI think one of the clearest learnings we have had this\nmorning is the importance of research and the importance of the\nrole of the Federal Government in conducting that research.\nAnd again, I think you know, I think of George Mitchell and\nfracking and the importance of revolutionary change and that\nwas supported, in some significant measure, by Department of\nEnergy research. That changed the world, and I think this is\nanother area.\nAgain, I think, Madam Chair, this is a place where there\ncould be a profitable combination between the Defense\nDepartment and the Department of Energy because of the\nimportant role that this plays with them.\nMr. Crabtree, you mentioned something in passing that I\nthink deserves emphasis. Rate design and the use of storage for\nbattery-powered automobiles to absorb excess capacity, energy\nand grid capacity, in the nighttime.\nThe grid, I have often characterized, is like a church that\nis built for Christmas morning and there are a lot of empty\npews in February and March, because it is literally designed\nfor the hottest, most heavily used day of the year and it has\nto be in order to be reliable.\nBut that means there is enormous excess delivery capacity,\nusually at night, particularly in the winter. And so, to the\nextent we could use rate design to encourage charging of\nautomobiles or to go further, to encourage things like\nelectrothermal storage, heating your water at night. I mean,\nthere are a lot of uses like that, I think. I am old enough to\nremember when we looked at our watch when it became nine\no'clock because the telephone call was cheaper.\n[Laughter.]\nPeople do change behaviors because of price signals. And\nright now there is really not a price signal, and yet there\nought to be and it would lead to a more efficient utilization\nof the grid without an increase of the capital cost, no new\nwires or poles which would lower the cost of distribution and\ntransmission for everyone because of more kilowatt-hours\ndivided by the same capital cost.\nSo I think that is a very important point. That is\nessentially a state level decision. But time-of-day pricing, I\nthink, is a very important part of this solution.\nFinally, Mr. Fowke, I admire your commitment to where you\nare going, to where you are taking your company and it is a\nvery important step for the country.\nOn the issue of shifting when we have household solar and\nbatteries, I think the important question there is we have to\nbe very precise about the value of what you are getting versus\nwhat it is costing. In other words, it is not a dead loss.\nThere are values to the utilities. There is a national security\nvalue in terms of the distribution of the grid so that if one\nplant or one transmission center goes down, the whole grid does\nnot go down. There are carbon avoidance values, resiliency,\npeak shaving, all of those things.\nSo I understand, but I just want to be sure the equation is\non both sides, that the value question is not just what is the\ncost and are we loading these costs on to other consumers, but\nwhat are also the benefits?\nAnd that, I think, that is an important part of this\nconsideration because there are places in the country where\nutilities have placed, I think, exorbitant penalties to\ndiscourage the development of distributed energy that are\nreally unjustified by the true cost equation.\nI think this is so incredibly important, and I commend the\npanel and the Chair. This has been a very important hearing,\nand I look forward to continuing the discussion.\nTo the extent any of you have follow-up thoughts, I hope\nyou will submit them to the Committee for our consideration.\nBut thank you all for the work that you are doing.\nMr. Davidson, thank you for the work you do in Maine. I\nthink you have 600 or 700 megawatts of hydropower in Maine. It\nis an important part of our energy resource, and I appreciate\nyour company's engagement with businesses and entities in our\nstate.\nThank you, Madam Chair.\nThe Chairman. Thank you, Senator.\nSenator Cortez Masto, any final thoughts?\nSenator Cortez Masto. So one area that dovetails--and we\nhave had hearings on this previously--with this conversation\nand any conversation we have when we are expanding access and\ninterconnectivity to the grid is cybersecurity. To me, that\nshould be incorporated into all of the discussions we have,\nparticularly as we build out the new architecture and we are\nlooking at incorporating new technologies.\nI do not know if anybody has a comment because that could\nbe a whole other hearing, but to me, that should always be a\nconsideration and always be a topic of the conversation when we\nare continuing to figure out our role here at a national level\nand a local level with respect to the grid.\nThe Chairman. Clearly a subject that is always on our mind\nas we look at any of these energy matters.\nWe appreciate the really good discussion I think that we\nhave had this morning. The efforts that you all bring from\ndifferent perspectives here, I think, helps round out the\nconversation in a way that is very helpful to us. So we thank\nyou for that.\nWe know that we have a lot more work to be done in this\nspace, but we recognize that it plays a very key role in how\nour energy future, our energy portfolio, really moves forward.\nWe thank you for your contribution, know that you will be\nhearing from us, whether it is additional questions from\nmembers here on the panel or on follow-on as we look to develop\nlegislation.\nWith that, I thank you very much, and the Committee stands\nadjourned.\n[Whereupon, at 12 p.m. the hearing was adjourned.]\nAPPENDIX MATERIAL SUBMITTED\n----------\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\n[all]",

Ron Johnson,\nChairman of the Committee, presiding.\nPresent: Senators Johnson, Scott, Hawley, Peters, Carper,\nand Hassan.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN JOHNSON\nChairman Johnson. Good afternoon. This roundtable is called\nto order.\nI want to thank all of our witnesses for your thoughtful\ntestimony and your time here today appearing before us\nanswering our questions.\nI would ask consent that my written statement\\1\\ be entered\ninto the record. Without objection.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The prepared statement of Senator Johnson appear in the\nAppendix on page 35.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJust real quick, I do want to remind everybody what\nChemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards stands for (CFATS).\nIt is not the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It is not\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). It is not\nDepartment of Defense (DOD). It is not Department of\nTransportation (DOT). This was a piece of legislation enacted\nto prevent the diversion basically for terrorist purposes of\nchemicals, and from my standpoint it should be focused on that.\nLast Congress, we had actually a larger roundtable, more\nparticipants. I learned a lot from that and found there was\nduplication with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and\nExplosives (ATF). We tried to address that in our bill that\npassed by voice vote. We tried to reward good behavior. If you\nare up to snuff and you have enacted a great plan here, we give\nyou some rewards in terms of less of a regulatory burden. You\nhave it covered. You do not need the nanny State coming in here\nand telling you exactly how to run your operation.\nI would hope that that will be--the goal of our ongoing\nefforts here is to reauthorize this, and I do realize those in\nindustry would like a long-term authorization. It is all part\nof the Stockholm Syndrome. They are kidnapped and they are just\nasking for a glass of water. They want some certainty, and I am\nhappy to give them that level of certainty.\nI do not think they want greater regulation. I do not think\nthey want CFATS to become an adjunct or an addition to OSHA and\nEPA and DOT and DOD. I am sure there is more of an alphabet\nsoup here of different agencies that control your lives. Again,\nI want to keep this thing focused. I appreciate everybody's\ninvolvement in here, but, hopefully that statement from the\nChairman of this Committee will provide some guidance in what\nwe are trying to do to reauthorize this program. We should\nreauthorize it for a longer period of time to provide that\ncertainty. But I think we should reform it without mission\ncreep.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Senator Peters.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR PETERS\nSenator Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will give a few\nopening remarks, too, but I would ask unanimous consent that my\nprepared statement----\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The prepared statement of Senator Peters appears in the\nAppendix on page 36.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChairman Johnson. I am not so sure about that. [Laughter.]\nWithout objection.\nSenator Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI would agree with the Chairman. At the most basic level,\nCFATS is about ensuring that certain chemicals never fall into\nthe hands of terrorists. That is its fundamental task. But by\nmost accounts that I have heard, at least, the program is well\nregarded. I have heard that from stakeholders, including\nindustry owners and operators, labor unions, and the Department\nof Homeland Security (DHS). And it has been my experience that\neverybody is seeking the certainty that a long-term extension\nof the program would bring, and I agree with that aspect, and I\nam happy to hear the Chairman also agrees that that is\nsomething that we need to seek out.\nWe need to keep the aspects of the program that are working\nwell and improve aspects of the program that are not to ensure\nthat CFATS is a mature and reliable security program on par\nwith other established and enduring compliance frameworks.\nImproving CFATS' focus on cybersecurity, employee engagement,\nwhistleblower protections, and outreach and coordination with\nfirst responders on-site, I think, are areas that there is some\nreal room for progress.\nSenator Johnson put forward a number of priorities in the\nlast Congress, and I look forward to working with the Chair and\nour House colleagues to find some common ground and to strike a\nbipartisan agreement that enhances security, reduces the risk\nof terrorist attacks, and protects workers and our communities.\nAnd I am confident, Mr. Chairman, that we can get that job\ndone, and I look forward to working with you in a very frank\nand productive discussion with the experts we have here today.\nChairman Johnson. I appreciate that, Senator Peters.\nWe will just go down the list. Everybody has been given a\ngenerous 2 minutes. [Laughter.]\nWe read your testimony, and it was very thoughtful, and\nthat will obviously be entered in the record. But if you can\njust summarize your main points in 2 minutes, and then we will\nopen it up for general discussion. And we do this a little bit\ndifferent than a hearing where we each get 7 minutes. It is\nreally more of an open discussion so that we stay on the same\npoint with different Senators going down that same vein or the\nsame line of questioning as opposed to hopping all over the\nplace with more formalized rounds.\nWe will start with Brian Harrell. Mr. Harrell currently\nserves as the Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Security\nof the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA),\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security. Mr. Harrell.\nTESTIMONY OF BRIAN HARRELL,\\1\\ ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR\nINFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY, CYBERSECURITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE\nSECURITY AGENCY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\nMr. Harrell. Alright. Thank you, Chairman Johnson, Ranking\nMember Peters, and Members of the Committee, for having me here\ntoday to discuss this important chemical security program.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The prepared statement of Mr. Harrell appears in the Appendix\non page 38.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChemicals are vital to our daily lives and economy. We use\nthem to develop medicines, refine fuels for our vehicles, and\nbuild microchips for smartphones. Despite these benefits,\nchemicals do not come without risk.\nWe live in a dynamic threat environment. Terrorists have\nshown the desire to seek out and use chemicals in devastating\nattacks, and our adversaries around the globe continue to\ntarget facilities that store or produce chemicals.\nThe threat environment is changing. While an attacker would\nhave to physically drive a vehicle bomb up to a building 20\nyears ago, today the attacker might target a chemical\nfacility's operating system or employ unmanned aircraft or a\ndrone to carry out an attack from the comfort of their remote\nlocation.\nEnsuring that does not happen is one of my chief reasons\nthat I sit before you today. CFATS, as a non-prescriptive,\nflexible anti-terrorism program is well suited to reduce the\nrisks of a chemical terrorist attack. Since its creation, CFATS\nhas identified chemical facilities that present the highest\nrisk in case of attack or exploitation, and we have worked to\nensure these facilities have security measures in place to\nreduce the risks of these hazardous chemicals. As a result, the\nlevel of security across the industry has significantly\nincreased, not only making a successful chemical attack more\ndifficult but also serving as a significant deterrent to our\nadversaries.\nChemical security is a shared commitment, and the gains\nmade by CFATS are the result of a strong working relationship\nwith our industry stakeholders, our government partners, and\nfirst responders.\nHowever, the Department recognizes that as the threat\nenvironment is constantly evolving, so, too, must CFATS. We are\nengaging our workforce and industry stakeholders on ways in\nwhich the regulation can continue to meet today's complex risk\nlandscape. We cannot be satisfied with our past progress, but\nwe must look for opportunities for improvement and adjust\nwithin the changing physical and cybersecurity landscape. This\nis a sign of a mature program.\nLast, recognizing that CFATS focuses its efforts on only a\nfraction of chemical facilities, the Department is considering\nother opportunities to assist the chemical facility population\nat large through voluntary initiatives. Chemical security must\nremain a high priority for the Nation. We cannot allow\nterrorists to access dangerous chemicals. If we can imagine a\nscenario, a motivated terrorist can imagine a more devastating\none.\nDHS looks forward to working with Congress toward a long-\nterm solution that includes both regulatory and voluntary\nefforts so that we can continue to defend today and secure\ntomorrow.\nThank you, and I look forward to the conversation.\nChairman Johnson. Our next witness is Nathan Anderson. Mr.\nAnderson currently serves as the Acting Director of the\nHomeland Security and Justice Team at the U.S. Government\nAccountability Office (GAO). Mr. Anderson.\nTESTIMONY OF NATHAN ANDERSON,\\1\\ ACTING DIRECTOR, HOMELAND\nSECURITY AND JUSTICE TEAM, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY\nOFFICE\nMr. Anderson. Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Peters,\nMembers of this Committee, good afternoon. We at GAO have\nissued a number of reports on CFATS over the last 7 years, and\nDHS has made substantial progress in a number of areas where we\nfound deficiencies such as identifying high-risk facilities,\nprioritizing them, and reviewing security plans. But there is\nroom for improvement, particularly in measuring the CFATS\nprogram's performance.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The prepared statement of Mr. Anderson appears in the Appendix\non page 44.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSometimes when people use terms like ``performance\nmeasures,'' it is difficult to understand the implications of\nshortcomings in this area, so let me be clear. When we identify\ndeficiencies in the program's performance measures, we are\nstating that improvements are needed so that decisionmakers\nhave the information necessary to gauge whether or in what form\nthe program should exist.\nIn our report from late last year, we found that DHS\nperformance measures for the CFATS program speak to program\naccomplishments, such as the number of facilities inspected,\nand these are important outputs. However, they do not measure\nprogram outcomes. One way to do this is to measure reductions\nin vulnerability at facilities that have resulted from\nimplementing required security measures.\nThink of this in terms of cost-benefit. We know the cost of\nthe CFATS program in terms of annual appropriations, and we\nhave information on the cost that industry has incurred through\ncompliance. But we do not have clear information on the\nbenefits, specifically the amount that risk is reduced through\ncompliance with the CFATS program. Such information is needed\nto assess the program's return on investment, and such measures\nexist in some other DHS component programs.\nMr. Chairman, Ranking Member Peters, and Members of the\nCommittee, this concludes my statement, and I look forward to\nthe discussion.\nChairman Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Anderson and Mr. Harrell.\nOur next witness is Matthew Fridley. Mr. Fridley is the\nSafety, Regulatory, and Security Manager at Brenntag North\nAmerica. He is also the current chair of the Chemical Sector\nCoordinating Council (CSCC). Mr. Fridley.\nTESTIMONY OF MATTHEW FRIDLEY,\\1\\ CORPORATE MANAGER, SAFETY,\nHEALTH, AND SECURITY, BRENNTAG NORTH AMERICA, ON BEHALF OF THE\nNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTORS\nMr. Fridley. Good afternoon, Chairman Johnson, Ranking\nMember Peters, and distinguished Members of the Committee.\nAgain, my name is Matthew Fridley, and I am the safety, health,\nand security manager for Brenntag North America, a chemical\ndistribution company headquartered in Reading, Pennsylvania.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The prepared statement of Mr. Fridley appears in the Appendix\non page 52.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn addition to my role at Brenntag, I am the chair of the\nChemical Sector Coordinating Council. I am also the vice chair\nof the Regulatory Affairs and Security Committee for the\nNational Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) on whose\nbehalf I am testifying today.\nI thank you for allowing me to participate in this\nimportant roundtable. Brenntag is currently the largest\nchemical distributor globally and the second largest chemical\ndistributor in the United States.\nI believe the CFATS program has made the chemical industry\nand our Nation much more secure with industry investing\nsignificant capital and training resources toward enhanced\nsecurity measures.\nDHS has generally taken a non-adversarial and balanced\napproach in implementing the CFATS program. DHS has excelled in\noutreach to industry in a number of ways. They include\nunderstanding the diversity of the chemical industry and\nworking with companies on security measures that meet the CFATS\nrisk-based performance standards (RBPS); interacting with\nchemical owners and operators; and always making inspectors and\nheadquarters personnel available to walk through and talk\nthrough issues or questions.\nOne priority I can recommend to the Committee is to require\nthat any changes to Appendix A: Chemicals of Interest (COI)\nlist remain subject to rulemaking and notice and comment.\nChanges to the COI list will have a major impact on my business\noperation and security investments.\nI also support the creation of the program under which DHS\nwould recognize companies that meet certain criteria such as\nparticipation in an initiative such as Responsible\nDistribution. By acknowledging the value of these industry\ninitiatives, DHS will be able to prioritize resources in\nnoncompliant outliers that pose a greater risk to security.\nIn 2014, the reauthorization further enhanced the security\nefforts by providing regulatory certainty to both industry and\nDHS, thereby increasing efficiencies in the program. It is my\nhope Congress can pass a long-term reauthorization of the CFATS\nprogram.\nOn behalf of both NACD and Brenntag, I appreciate the\nopportunity to present our views on this important issue.\nChairman Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Fridley.\nOur next witness is Timothy O'Brien. Mr. O'Brien is\nPresident of Detotec North America, an explosive manufacturing\ncompany headquartered in Sterling, Connecticut. Mr. O'Brien.\nTESTIMONY OF TIM O'BRIEN,\\1\\ PRESIDENT, DETOTEC NORTH AMERICA\nMr. O'Brien. Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Peters, and\nMembers of the Committee, as president of Detotec North America\nand past chairman of the Institute of Makers of Explosives, I\nthank you for the opportunity to discuss the CFATS program.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The prepared statement of Mr. O'Brien appears in the Appendix\non page 60.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe commercial explosives industry has been regulated for\nsecurity since 1971 by ATF. Following the tragic events of\nSeptember 11, 2001 (9/11), Congress passed the Homeland\nSecurity Act of 2002, which strengthened ATF's mission to\nprotect the public from the diversion of explosives for illicit\nuse, including acts of terrorism.\nReports from the U.S. Bomb Data Center show a consistent\ndecline in thefts of explosives over the past 30 years. CFATS\nhas had no perceptible impact on security for commercial\nexplosives. This may have been the reason why DHS stated before\nthis Committee last year that they would ``lose no sleep over\nexplosives leaving the program.''\nSince Detotec opened 30 years ago, we have been compliant\nwith ATF's comprehensive security regulations. In all that\ntime, we have never experienced a theft or diversion of our\nproducts. In 2008, Detotec submitted our first CFATS Top-\nScreens and received conditional authorization in 2013.\nIn 2016, we submitted new Top-Screens based on a new\ntiering methodology. Between the authorizations and the new\nTop-Screens, we were inspected 10 times by ATF, DOD, and the\nDefense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). No security concerns\nwere raised, and we were found to be in full compliance.\nDespite our record, DHS required additional security\nmeasures from us. DHS made suggestions for compliance, and our\ncost estimates for those ranged from $400,000 to over $1\nmillion. That would have shut us down.\nBy the time we found a viable plan, we were 10 days late,\nresulting in a fine of $100,000. Detotec was able to reduce the\namount paid through a small business process; however, an\nemployee had to be let go.\nLet me reiterate: I had to lay off an employee to pay a\nfine for failing to submit to DHS my plan for what we would\nimplement in 6 months, not for failure to implement those\nmeasures.\nI do not appear before you to ask for deregulation of\ncommercial explosives, but to make the case for removing ATF-\nregulated materials from CFATS, which will cut costs for\ntaxpayers and reduce duplicative regulation without having a\nnegative effect on national security.\nThank you. I look forward to any questions that you may\nhave.\nChairman Johnson. Thank you, Mr. O'Brien.\nOur next witness is William Erny. Mr. Erny is a Senior\nDirector at the American Chemistry Council (ACC), which\nrepresents over 170 businesses involved in the chemistry\nindustry. Mr. Erny.\nTESTIMONY OF WILLIAM ERNY,\\1\\ SENIOR DIRECTOR, AMERICAN\nCHEMISTRY COUNCIL\nMr. Erny. Yes, good afternoon. As you all know, the\nbusiness of chemistry is a major economic driver here in the\nUnited States. We are a $526 billion enterprise, and we are\ngrowing.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The prepared statement of Mr. Erny appears in the Appendix on\npage 70.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIt is because of this critical role in the economy that\nchemical security continues to be a major priority for ACC and\nits members, and to demonstrate this commitment, this year\nmarks the 31st anniversary of ACC's Responsible Care program.\nResponsible Care is the leading chemical industry stewardship\nprogram. Under Responsible Care, our members have invested more\nthan $17 billion to enhance security at all of our sites.\nThe CFATS program also plays a very critical role in\nprotecting chemicals. CFATS provides a baseline to set for the\nindustry that covers all facilities that they must adhere to.\nAs such, ACC supports long-term authorization.\nIt is true that DHS has made a lot of progress over the\nlast 4\\1/2\\ years. However, we would like to make some\nadditional recommendations we believe would further enhance the\nprogram.\nOne, DHS should maintain its focus on chemical security.\nCFATS should retain its core mission of chemical security, not\nwander into other areas such as safety and environmental\nrequirements that we believe would serve to sort of water down\ntheir current focus and resources on their core mission.\nTwo, personal surety, terrorist screening for Tiers 3 and\n4, lower-risk tiers, should be optional. DHS has recently\nannounced they plan on expanding terrorist screening to more\nthan 3,000 additional lower-risk facilities, including tens of\nthousands of additional workers and contractors. In a nutshell,\nwe believe this is just too far, it is too much, and it is not\nnecessary.\nAnd then item number three, establish a CFATS recognition\nprogram. DHS should leverage chemical industry stewardship\nprograms such as Responsible Care by providing regulatory\nrecognition for responsible operators. Such a program would\nenhance the current stewardship programs that are available and\nincentivize the creation of new programs.\nIt is a fact that companies who participate in industry\nstewardship programs outperform their peers and the industry as\na whole. Creating a CFATS recognition program would enhance\nchemical security across the sector and beyond the universe of\nthe regulated community.\nIn closing, I would just like to say that CFATS has helped\nmake our industry and our communities more secure. We encourage\nthis Committee to consider these proposed changes and to\nprovide long-term authorization for CFATS.\nThank you, and I look forward to our discussion.\nChairman Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Erny.\nOur next witness is Andrew Wright. Mr. Wright is the Vice\nPresident of Legislative Affairs of the International Liquid\nTerminals Association (ILTA), representing both terminal and\nsupply members that transport liquid products. Mr. Wright.\nTESTIMONY OF ANDREW WRIGHT,\\1\\ VICE PRESIDENT, LEGISLATIVE\nAFFAIRS, INTERNATIONAL LIQUID TERMINALS ASSOCIATION\nMr. Wright. Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Peters, and\nMembers of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to\nparticipate in today's roundtable.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The prepared statement of Mr. Wright appears in the Appendix on\npage 73.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe International Liquid Terminals Association represents\nthe tank and terminals industry in all 50 States. ILTA members\nprovide storage and transportation logistics and value-added\nservices for a wide range of liquid commodities, including\ncrude oil, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and chemicals.\nILTA appreciates the critical role that DHS and the CFATS\nprogram play in maintaining our Nation's security and supports\nthe CFATS coalition priorities.\nHowever, I want to focus on an ILTA recommendation to\ncorrect the treatment of gasoline, diesel, and other fuel\nmixtures. All flammable materials identified as chemicals of\ninterest have a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)\nrating of Class 4, which is extremely flammable, with the\nnotable and problematic exception of gasoline Class 3 along\nwith diesel, kerosene, and jet fuel, all of which are Class 2.\nFaced with the best science and the most authoritative\nstandard in use today for the characterization of flammable\nmaterials, DHS no longer requires those facilities to perform\ntop-screen evaluations based solely on the presence of these\nmixtures. In fact, for nearly a decade, gasoline, diesel,\nkerosene, and jet fuel have effectively not been regulated\nunder CFATS because of a DHS regulatory hold. Therefore, in\npractice, DHS recognizes the lower risk associated with\ngasoline and other fuel blends. We believe that it is time to\nbring the regulation in line with current DHS practice and\nremove the unjustified exception that would incorrectly treat\nthese products as if they were chemicals of interest.\nILTA and its member companies have worked unsuccessfully\nthrough regulatory channels for more than 10 years to correct\nthe mistaken treatment of gasoline and fuel blends that are\nstill written into the regulations. Only Congress can focus\nCFATS on plausible security risk and ensure that gasoline and\nfuel mixtures are removed from CFATS during this and future\nAdministrations.\nI look forward to your questions.\nChairman Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Wright.\nOur final witness, last but not least, is John Morawetz.\nMr. Morawetz is a Health and Safety Representative for the\nInternational Chemical Workers Union Council and the United\nFood and Commercial Workers (UFCW) International Union. Mr.\nMorawetz.\nTESTIMONY OF JOHN S. MORAWETZ,\\1\\ HEALTH AND SAFETY\nREPRESENTATIVE, INTERNATIONAL CHEMICAL WORKERS UNION COUNCIL,\nUNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS INTERNATIONAL UNION\nMr. Morawetz. Thank you, Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member\nPeters, and Committee Members for the honor of appearing before\nyou on chemical facilities security and safety. I represent, as\nyou said, the Chemical Workers and UFCW. We represent 20,000\nmembers in 32 States and strongly support a multiyear\nreauthorization with four improvements.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The prepared statement of Mr. Morawetz appears in the Appendix\non page 76.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOne, our members work with many CFATS Appendix A extremely\nhazardous substance and have a vested interest in a facility\noperation for everyone's well-being. Thankfully, there has not\nbeen a terrorist attack on a chemical plant, but we can learn\nfrom unintentional releases at our facilities, including a\nmassive release in Houston that killed four people and a\ncomplete rupture of a full chlorine tanker car in West\nVirginia.\nMost tragically, in 1971, a Georgia facility that\nmanufactured magnesium trip flares had some fires and blew up.\nHorribly, the evacuation distance was not sufficient, and 27\nworkers were killed.\nOur recommendations:\nFirst, workers and labor representatives need to be\ninvolved in protecting our chemical infrastructure. Workers'\ndaily expertise must be utilized and documented in the\ndrafting, implementation, and evaluation of plant security\nplans. I would love to talk about CFATS inspections, but our\nlocals and members are often not included while other Federal\nagencies have established joint management-labor inspection\nmodels.\nSecond, everyone, including CFATS inspectors, must be\ntrained on specific hazards, responses, their roles and drills.\nThird, whistleblowers must not face retaliation. DHS must\nhave procedures on whistleblower retaliation, including at\nleast 90 days to file a complaint, a private right of action,\nand for representatives to file complaints.\nLast, DHS knows how facilities use best practices to reduce\ntheir risk, including safer substances, reductions in storage,\nand just-in-time use, and that information should be released\nannually.\nThank you, and I would be glad for the continuing\ndiscussion.\nChairman Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Morawetz.\nLet me just start. I come from a manufacturing background,\nand it was my experience that the whole safety issue started\nwith local police and fire public safety organizations. We\nwould get frequent visits by the fire department. Do you have\nany hazardous chemicals? Where are they located? What the\nquantities were, what is your evacuation plan, those types of\nthings. So, kind of like the Federal Emergency Management\nAgency (FEMA), a layered approach, local, State, and then\nFederal.\nWhat we have here with CFATS after 9/11 is a whole new\nprogram specifically designed to keep dangerous chemicals that\ncould be used in a terrorist attack out of the hands of\nterrorists. I do not believe the intent of Congress--and had I\nbeen here, I would have fought that intent--was to have an all-\nencompassing regulatory agency governing worker safety, fire\nhazards, chemical discharge, potential pollution issues.\nI want to start questioning with industry: What agencies\nregulate your businesses already in addition to DHS? We will\nstart with Mr. Fridley because you look like you are ready to\ngo here.\nMr. Fridley. Yes, pretty much the alphabet soup, as you\nstated earlier, Chairman.\nChairman Johnson. So give us the most significant ones, if\nyou can.\nMr. Fridley. Obviously, EPA, OSHA, DOT, DEA, we have ATF,\nwe have the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Coast\nGuard (USCG) as well because we have the Maritime\nTransportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA) facilities, are the\nprimary, along with DHS.\nChairman Johnson. And you are heavily regulated by most of\nthose.\nMr. Fridley. Yes, sir.\nChairman Johnson. It is not like you do not get visited. It\nis not like they are ignoring those issues that they are\nconcerned about.\nMr. Fridley. That is correct.\nChairman Johnson. Mr. O'Brien.\nMr. O'Brien. ATF would be our primary agency that oversees\nus, and they in the past have clearly stated that they\neffectively regulate the security of commercial explosives,\nemphasizing that the only value DHS adds relative to explosives\nis the regulation of the precursor chemicals. We are visited\nroutinely by them. We have very prescriptive regulations by\nthem, that they tell us exactly what we have to do.\nChairman Johnson. Describe ``routinely.'' How often do you\nget site visits from ATF?\nMr. O'Brien. So at a minimum, you are inspected every 3\nyears because a license lasts 3 years. My particular company\nhas three separate licenses, so they happen to fall one a year.\nSo we were getting visits one every year by ATF. And when they\ncome in, they will come in and examine exactly how much\nexplosives we have, down to the gram. They will count all of\nthe detonators we have. They will count everything. There is no\nthreshold at which, OK, this program only applies if you are\nover a certain level. If we have a gram or higher, we are\nregulated by ATF.\nThey also have a vetting program because after the Safe\nExplosives Act of 2002, all of our downstream customers had to\nget a license. So they have all gone through the ATF vetting\nprocess as well. They will verify that we are only receiving\nand giving out explosives to companies that----\nChairman Johnson. I do not want to get too far in the\nweeds.\nMr. Erny. By the way, this is my first and only kind of\nstructured question. Then we are going to throw it open. If you\nwant to say something on an issue, put your name tag up so we\ncan call on you, OK. Mr. Erny, quickly.\nMr. Erny. Sure. To add on to the ones that I think I caught\nmentioned so far, some of the additional ones, in addition to\nOSHA and EPA and the regular ones, would be DOT, for instance.\nThey have security regulations in place that handle en route\nsecurity of chemicals, which include the sale point and the end\npoint as well. So there is a lot of crossover and duplication\nin that.\nThe Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and its\nrail security regulation, very involved in sort of the\ntransportation via rail of chemical products.\nCustoms and Border Protection (CBP) and Customs-Trade\nPartnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) program, not a\nregulation, voluntary, but the nature of it and the importance\nof it to import chemicals across the border makes it\nessentially a must-do.\nAnd then FDA with food-grade chemicals and things of that\nnature.\nChairman Johnson. Mr. Wright.\nMr. Wright. Yes, Senator----\nChairman Johnson. Can you add anything to that?\nMr. Wright. Well, the Coast Guard. A lot of our facilities\nare maritime, so we have the Coast Guard, EPA, OSHA, DHS, DOT.\nI would add we have a lot of State and local regulation on our\nfacilities. We probably have as much from the States as we do--\nobviously, it varies State to State, but we probably have as\nmuch from the States as we do from the Feds.\nChairman Johnson. Again, we got more site visits by the\nlocal fire department. So a show of hands, does anybody feel\nyou are underregulated?\n[No hands raised.]\nOK. Senator Peters, do you have something?\nSenator Peters. I will do a couple.\nMr. Morawetz, in your opening remarks, you discussed the\nneed to improve employee engagement in the development and\nimplementation of these assessments. I think as you mentioned\nin your opening comments, chemical workers are routinely not\nconsulted. Is that correct?\nMr. Morawetz. That is correct.\nSenator Peters. Can you discuss the security benefits of\nengaging more broadly with these chemical workers on the site\nplans? Why do we need to try to facilitate that in your mind?\nMr. Morawetz. I would say it is no different than any other\nparty at this table or any stakeholder involved in this\nprocess, that if you leave anybody out, you lose some vital\ninformation. In particular, the people who actually operate the\nmachinery, the reactor vessels, the storage vessels, the\npiping, everything, if they are not involved, then I think we\nlose potentially some information, and basically from a\nterrorist attack--and that is what we are concentrated on; I\nagree with that--we are at greater risk if we do not include\npeople.\nSenator Peters. So you are saying they are not included for\nall the benefits to potentially be there, but they are not\nincluded now in this current program? Could you discuss your\nexperience with inspectors in other compliance programs that\nmay be a good model for us to look at?\nMr. Morawetz. I have experience, direct experience with\nthree: the National Institute for Occupational Safety and\nHealth (NIOSH)--I worked at NIOSH for 2 years; OSHA--OSHA\ninspected some of these facilities; and the Chemical Safety\nBoard. The facility that I mentioned where four people got\nkilled, it was a massive release of methyl mercaptan. It was\nthe subject of OSHA regulations. It was the subject of a\nChemical Safety Board investigation. It is actually still\npending. It was basically a seamless, easy process. The\ninspectors come in. There is a union there or the union knows.\nThey sit down. They meet together. The vast majority of the\ntime you sit down and you meet and you discuss the problem and\ntry to resolve it.\nA rare situation where one side or the other says, ``No, I\nwant to meet separately.'' Then there are separate meetings\nwith both parties. I think there is a lot to be gained for\ninspectors in doing that and, in particular, it puts me at a\ndisadvantage of answering a lot of questions about CFATS, how\nit applies with the other gentlemen know more, because we only\nhave found one facility where our members know and have been\ninvolved with the CFATS program.\nSenator Peters. The current CFATS program also does not\nhave real whistleblower retaliation protections in place. Would\nyou talk a little bit about why that may be problematic?\nMr. Morawetz. I do not have direct experience with the\nchemical workers. However, in the news, our whistleblowers may\nbe biased, but I tend to think where a union is in place, a\nwhistleblower situation is less inclined to get to an extreme\nposition and things resolve easier. We work with a couple of\nDepartment of Energy (DOE) facilities, and in those facilities,\nfor the last, I think, about 5 or 6 years, there has been a\nwhole move toward a culture of safety based upon a DOE worker\nwho complained. It was a whistleblower complaint. His job was\ntaken away from him. He had his pay, but he was put into a\ndifferent office basically doing nothing. That is one. There\nare other articles today about American Federation of\nGovernment Employees (AFGE) in Kansas City, I believe, that\nthere is a whistleblower complaint. So it can happen.\nSenator Peters. Yes. I have other questions, but I will\ndefer so Senator Hawley can ask his questions, if that is\nalright, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Johnson. Senator Hawley.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HAWLEY\nSenator Hawley. Thank you very much. I just want to note\nthat Missouri companies often tell us what while they support\nthe intent of regulations like CFATS, these regulations are\noften redundant, contradictory, poorly defined, as many of you\nhave testified today, and it makes it harder and costlier for\nthem to meet the requirements, and that is especially true in\nthe case of small businesses.\nI want to just ask about the commercial security\ninitiatives. Mr. Fridley, I think it was in your written\ntestimony, you wrote that verified industry standard programs\nand insurance carriers often require companies to maintain\ncontingency plans that are ``as comprehensive as the\ncontingency plans required by government agencies and often\nhave much more applicability and effectiveness in real-world\nsituations.'' That is from your testimony. Do you want to say\nsomething more about that?\nMr. Fridley. Yes, Senator Hawley. Thank you for the\nquestion. There are obviously municipalities, there are\ninsurance requirements. I have five facilities, over 100 people\nemployed in the State of Missouri, so we see this----\nSenator Hawley. We are so glad you do.\nMr. Fridley. But, yes, everybody has different aspects that\nthey want as part of that contingency plan. How we are doing\nsome of these things is we are leveraging the different\nagencies and different ones on how we can do one plan that\nsatisfies multiple agency requirements, insurance requirements\nand such.\nWe are doing that same thing with our security models. We\nare looking at the various requirements by the different\nagencies, and we are putting in one security system, that will\nbe able to be managed and be applied by all. So we are not\nnecessarily seeing the duplicative portion of it, at least not\nin my experience.\nSenator Hawley. Let me just ask Mr. Harrell on that point,\ncan you speak to how CFATS is leveraging or considering\nleverages commercial security initiatives to advance the goal\nof protecting chemical facilities and then, wherever possible,\nto reduce any duplicative or unnecessary regulatory burdens on\nbusiness?\nMr. Harrell. Absolutely. I just got to the Department back\nin December, so I have often said in this forum that I have\nbeen a regulator, I have been regulated, and now I am seeing\nthings through kind of that Federal lens. I am very sensitive\nto that duplicative nature of compliance and regulatory\nstandards. I think it is very important to reduce where we can.\nI think that is where the Department of Homeland Security has\ndone a good job of engaging with the other Federal regulators\nout there. We have routine meetings with them to ensure that\nwhile we may show up on a Monday, that somebody else is not\nshowing up on a Tuesday, which would be completely disruptive\nto private industry. Coming from private industry, I am very\nsensitive to that.\nI think we have done a good job of ensuring that there is\ncoordinating and the ability to share information back and\nforth, which I think prevents some of the issues that you are\ndescribing.\nSenator Hawley. Very good. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman Johnson. Mr. Morawetz, let me ask you, you said in\nOSHA you have the ability, labor has the ability to input into\nOSHA's process, into their inspections?\nMr. Morawetz. Yes.\nChairman Johnson. What other Federal agencies does labor\nhave the input right?\nMr. Morawetz. In an OSHA inspection?\nChairman Johnson. Well, what about EPA? What about the\nDepartment of Transportation?\nMr. Morawetz. I do not have direct experience with EPA. So\nmy experience is NIOSH, OSHA, and Chemical Safety Board, and\nbasically there are joint meetings. There are separate\nconversations. We have access to information, letters, etc.,\nand we discuss the questions and see what--in particular, not\nso much me, but I would say the rank-and-file members who know\nmore information about processes and dangers, they get involved\nin it.\nChairman Johnson. Most union contracts lay out a process\nfor workers to come forward and lodge certain safety concerns\nor other types of problems, correct? Most formal labor\nagreements? That would be a true statement?\nMr. Morawetz. I do not have really direct experience\nexactly what particular contracts say about bringing health and\nsafety concerns. I know contracts often have a health and\nsafety committee, so there is a process set up.\nChairman Johnson. I know what I have experienced coming\nfrom the private sector to the public sector. Whistleblower\nretaliation is far more prevalent--I do not know how many\norders of magnitude more prevalent--within government than it\never was in the private sector, because in the private sector\nyou can get sued out of existence if you use and abuse your\nemployees that way. Do you have a different experience?\nMr. Morawetz. I could not compare private and public. Most\nof our main job is not involved with retaliation, so, really,\nit is hard for me to----\nChairman Johnson. My understanding is that workers have a\ngreat deal of protection when it comes to whistleblowing on\ntheir employers, whether it is a labor issue, whether it is a\nsafety issue. Just go right down the line. Just get an\nattorney, and you will find out how many rights you have in the\nprivate sector as a whistleblower against an employer.\nAgain, I am not seeing a great need to offer additional\nwhistleblower protection within something like CFATS, which\nshould be a narrowly focused piece of legislation about keeping\ndangerous chemicals out of the hands of terrorists.\nMr. Morawetz. Generally from my experience, talking to\nrepresentatives, the vice president of the union, they really\nfeel that because it is not so much public sector but because\nthey have a union contract in that structure, that it is more\nlikely that there will not be that kind of situation. In non-\nunion facilities, we feel that that intimidation is much real\nand can happen more readily. And my personal experience and\ndifferent ways that I have heard from people, I think the fear\non the job is a very real factor.\nChairman Johnson. Mr. Wright, real quick, because I am not\nfollowing the Class 2, 3, and 4, really describe what you are\ntalking about here. Are all the liquids exempted from CFATS\nexcept for gasoline and diesel fuel? Or are they all under it\nexcept for--describe what you are talking about.\nMr. Wright. Yes, Senator. I am sorry. That is sort of\ncomplicated. Only 4's are included as COIs. However--and that\nwas the specific rule that DHS put into the regulation. But\nthen away from Appendix A, they put a couple of little\nparagraphs in that brought gasoline in, diesel fuel, kerosene,\neven though it was not a 4, but a 3 or a 2.\nChairman Johnson. This is as clear as mud right now. I am\nsorry. What liquids were included to be covered under CFATS in\nthe original law?\nMr. Wright. Well, things like--I mean, we are talking about\nflammables. I mean, it would be----\nChairman Johnson. OK, flammable liquids.\nMr. Wright. Yes.\nChairman Johnson. That is what you are dealing--again,\ntalking about your industry. So which ones were included under\nthe law?\nMr. Wright. It would be chemicals like propane, for\nexample, that need to be kept under pressure, that are\ngenuinely highly flammable, that might explode. Basically the\nthing that we are trying to prevent here is for terrorists to\nbe able to use something as a weapon that, in the case of\nflammables, that might explode and cause damage outside the\nfence. With gasoline, it will burn but it will not explode. I\ncall it the ``A Team effect.'' You watch these television\nshows, and they bump up against a car and the car explodes.\nChairman Johnson. So liquids that were not only flammable\nbut explodable were included in the law?\nMr. Wright. That is correct.\nChairman Johnson. And then by regulation----\nMr. Wright. Well, it was included in the regulation.\nChairman Johnson. So included in the regulation.\nMr. Wright. Under Title A--or under Appendix A. But then\nthey just added gasoline in and kerosene and the other\nflammables.\nChairman Johnson. So they added liquids that are flammable\nbut not explosive.\nMr. Wright. Correct.\nChairman Johnson. Are they regulating them now?\nMr. Wright. They are not regulating them now under a\nregulatory hold.\nChairman Johnson. And you are asking to put something in\nthis piece of legislation to prevent them from adding that at a\nlater date, to make the distinction between a liquid that is\nflammable and non-explosive versus a liquid that is flammable\nand explosive?\nMr. Wright. That is basically the case.\nChairman Johnson. Is that the----\nMr. Wright. But right now, Senator, they are not\nregulating, but the regulation still exists. It is just on a\nregulatory hold.\nChairman Johnson. I am trying to get clarity.\nMr. Harrell, tell me, is that an accurate description of\nwhat we are talking about here with flammable liquids? You are\nincluding under CFATS and regulating under CFATS flammable and\nexplosive liquids but not strictly flammable, although you are\nreserving the option to do so?\nMr. Harrell. Yes, absolutely. So what he is describing is,\nin fact, accurate. There are a number of chemicals that are\noriginally part of Appendix A that we have since essentially\nminimized. And so now as we move forward, we are willing and\nopen to have this conversation of removing these chemicals from\nAppendix A. But that will require rulemaking.\nChairman Johnson. Or law.\nMr. Harrell. Correct.\nChairman Johnson. We could do that as part of this\nreauthorization, make it very explicit so it is not necessarily\nup to one regulator after the next going, ``OK. No, we changed\nour mind.''\nMr. Harrell. And I think that is----\nChairman Johnson. Wouldn't it be better to kind of lay out\nexactly what CFATS is all about? Why are we doing this? What is\nthe purpose of CFATS? Anti-terrorism. And what chemicals are we\ntrying to protect from what?\nMr. Harrell. I think we agree with that.\nChairman Johnson. Is there a generalized statement you can\nmake in terms of what CFATS is supposed to be dealing with in\nterms of chemicals, an overall mission statement?\nMr. Harrell. So, the overall mission statement would be the\nDepartment's role in risk reduction, right? So removing or\nmitigating the risk of high-risk chemicals for chemical\nfacilities across the country.\nChairman Johnson. Now define high-risk chemicals. Wouldn't\nthat be the next step? So now define a high-risk chemical.\nMr. Harrell. Right. So that potentially could do\nsignificant harm, cause a number of deaths, and have giant\nexplosions throughout the country, that we would otherwise feel\nuncomfortable with as a country, as a Nation; that and the\nstealing of those chemicals that could be used potentially\nagainst soft targets or otherwise.\nChairman Johnson. Do you have that definition anywhere\nwithin regulation, whatever a high-risk chemical is?\nMr. Harrell. We do, and I have not committed it to memory,\nbut I am sure we have it.\nChairman Johnson. OK, great. I would like to see what that\ndefinition is.\nAny of you folks aware of what that definition is of a\nhigh-risk chemical?\n[Witnesses shaking heads.]\nYou have obviously looked at this. Do you understand what\nthe mission is of the CFATS regulation? Are they following that\nmission?\nMr. Anderson. Yes, sir, absolutely. When we speak of high-\nrisk chemicals, we are talking about chemicals in X quantity\npast a certain threshold could inflict mass danger based on a\ngeographic distance of concern. And what we have looked at\nrecently is how the methodology has changed, how CFATS has\nbecome more mature and has a better understanding for where\nthere might be higher consequences or lower consequences. And\nthere was a peer-reviewed study by Sandia National Labs where\nthey got into that and made some changes to how they define\nrisk.\nChairman Johnson. Again, Appendix A was developed under the\nregulatory regime, and the industry had the opportunity to\ncomment on that? Did DHS do a pretty good job of responding to\ncomments and lay out that list where it made sense? Go ahead,\nMr. O'Brien. By the way, I am not here to litigate your\nparticular case.\nMr. O'Brien. No, nor am I saying--but from our experience,\nwe know that ATF was only engaged very late in the process. So\nI was just going to offer that perspective.\nChairman Johnson. Duplicative regulation is different than\nwhat I am talking about right now. Right now I am trying to\ntalk about how CFATS defined its mission, how it came up with\nAppendix A, what the definition of those risky chemicals are,\nand whether that Appendix A makes sense, and does it need\nfurther refinement? Or does the definition need further\nrefinement?\nMr. Wright, you had----\nMr. Wright. Yes, thank you, Senator. I just wanted to point\nout that when we were included, we went back to DHS in 2009\nwith white papers, evidence, and said, look, this is not a\nchemical of mass effect. We can have a fire but we are not\ngoing to have an explosion. And they basically as a result of\nthat quit regulating us, but they would never change the\nunderlying regulation. And that is why we are asking the Senate\nto exercise some oversight and say, OK, 10 years is long\nenough, let us make the regulation meet the reality--I mean the\npolicy meet the reality.\nChairman Johnson. Mr. Harrell, real quick, do you kind of\nagree--you are just in the position now. Do you agree with that\ndistinction between something that is flammable, but then you\nhave a ton of it could cause real damage, versus something that\nis flammable and explosive in terms of a risky chemical.\nMr. Harrell. Indeed, yes, so there is a difference between\nthe two. I think DHS is absolutely committed to having the\nconversation back and forth with this Committee to do what\nmakes sense and to remove or add things if we had to, to\nAppendix A through rulemaking.\nChairman Johnson. And to me, again, the whole purpose of\nreauthorization is to provide certainty, and if we can kind of\ndo that--gasoline has been around a while. It is not like this\nis a new issue. I think we should bring certainty to this. If\nyou are going to regulate it, regulate it. If not, you are not.\nI would tend to agree, kind of the explosive definition.\nMr. Fridley, you had a comment?\nMr. Fridley. Yes, the only thing I would want to make sure\nis we are very careful with what we are going to change as far\nas Appendix A, whether we are going to take away from or add\nto, percentages, poundage, it could be anything, because any\nminor change could have significant consequences to my\nindustry.\nChairman Johnson. OK. By the way, I agree. This is all\nabout bringing certainty.\nMr. Fridley. Yes, absolutely.\nChairman Johnson. If we have an Appendix A that can be\nchangeable depending on Administration or the administrator or\nregulator, I would say it does not bring a great deal of\ncertainty.\nNow, if we develop new chemicals, we learn something new\nabout something, but we know what gasoline does. If it is not\ngoing to be regulated, it should not be on the list. We\nprobably ought to take that out, I would think, legislatively.\nAgain, you guys hop in here. Otherwise, I will just keep\ngoing.\nSenator Peters. Let me----\nChairman Johnson. Just hop in. I want this free-flowing.\nSenator Peters. I should have hopped in on some of the\nwhistleblower information. I want to get back to you, Mr.\nMorawetz. The Chairman was asking you about union protections\nfor folks who are whistleblowers. It is true if you are in a\nunion, you usually have a lot of additional protections, but I\nunderstand a lot of the companies in this industry are not\nunionized. Is that correct?\nMr. Morawetz. That is correct.\nSenator Peters. So they would not have those kinds of\nprotections----\nMr. Morawetz. That is correct.\nSenator Peters [continuing]. That you have in a union, so\nthat is why we are looking at this broadly as protections to\nmake sure we are creating a work environment where when people\nsee things that are not right, they know they will not----\nChairman Johnson. But there are plenty of protections\nwithin law.\nSenator Peters. Well, yes, but you must have a process that\nmakes it a lot easier than saying, well, you are going to get\nfired, you must hire a lawyer, you are going to be out of work\nfor a few years. You are going to have to litigate the case. I\nmean, that is not really reasonable for folks. That is still\ngoing to create an environment that is not conducive to folks\nwho are seeing things, particularly workers who are on the\nfront lines and are actually engaged in this activity.\nChairman Johnson. Not to interrupt, but I am going to\ninterrupt. You have the exact same thing with the law in CFATS.\nAgain, what I am saying is there is already whistleblower\nprotection in law. Do we need another layer of whistleblower\nprotection in law within a specific program? I am happy to look\nat that.\nSenator Peters. We will talk about it. We have an actual\nprocess where the person continues to stay in the job,\ncontinues to work, does not have to----\nChairman Johnson. And that exists in law. We will figure\nout where that is and work that out.\nSenator Peters. Yes, we had a GAO report titled,\n``Improvements Needed for DHS Chemical Facility Whistleblower\nReport Process.'' There is a long title. And included in the\nDHS response, which was dated back in 2016, the DHS, Mr.\nHarrell, was going to move forward with some of that. Were such\nwhistleblower retaliation rules ever issued as a result of that\nGAO report, to your knowledge?\nMr. Harrell. So DHS has developed a documented process and\nprocedure to address and investigate whistleblower retaliation\nreports, and we can share this process with this Committee.\nHowever, DHS will need to complete rulemaking to fully\nimplement the whistleblower retaliation provision.\nWe value whistleblower provisions and any program that\ninvestigates any retaliation claims. However--and this is\nreally to Senator Johnson's point. CFATS is focused on anti-\nterrorism, facility security, and risk reduction, so this is\noutside of our subject matter expertise.\nSo we would like to work with Congress to develop a program\nthat meets the needs of industry, facility employees, and, of\ncourse, the Department.\nSenator Peters. Mr. Harrell, the President's Fiscal Year\n(FY) 2020 budget includes about $18 million in cuts to CFATS.\nIf the cut were implemented, how would that impact your\nprogram?\nMr. Harrell. So any budget cut, whether you are in the\nprivate sector or you are in the Federal Government, will\ncertainly impact operations. So my job is really to minimize\nthose impacts and assure that we do not diminish national\nsecurity or allow foreseeable risks to materialize. So CISA\nwill continue to approve facility security plans and conduct\ninspections, although probably at a somewhat reduced rate.\nThe good news is, though, we have streamlined many of our\nprocesses and inspections over the years, and we have matured.\nWe have improved training and implemented measures to ensure\nthe consistency across the country.\nSo, ultimately, at the end of the day, though, we would\nneed to curtail some of our inspector training, some of our\ntravel, and some of our outreach as some of the low-hanging\nfruit there of how we would curtail.\nSenator Peters. So $18 million is low-hanging fruit?\nMr. Harrell. No. We will continue the mission. We will\ncontinue to execute. It will just be somewhat of a slower\nprocess and a bit reduced other than normal operations.\nSenator Peters. Has the Department's focus on the Southern\nBorder impacted any of the CFATS program in any way?\nMr. Harrell. It has had zero impact.\nSenator Peters. Zero impact. A few weeks ago, a notice went\nout to all CISA employees soliciting volunteers to go to the\nSouthern Border. Did any of your personnel volunteer to be\ndeployed down to the Southern Border?\nMr. Harrell. They did, yes. So the Cybersecurity and\nInfrastructure Security Agency had a number of employees\nvolunteer, some of which came from the Infrastructure Security\nDivision, my division, and so there are some down there now.\nSenator Peters. How many in total?\nMr. Harrell. I do not have the total number offhand, but we\nhave a few down there. But in terms of impact, in terms of that\noperational impact, not doing inspections or slowing the\nprocess down of approving site security plans, there has been\nnone of that.\nSenator Peters. OK. During the February 27 House hearing on\nCFATS, Director David Wulf mentioned that thousands of\nfacilities have lowered their tier or have tiered out and are\nno longer considered high risk. I think we should all consider\nthat probably a good thing that that happened. It seems to me\nthat there are fewer facilities that are high risk.\nSo my question for you, Mr. Harrell, is: Has DHS done\nanything to inform facilities still covered by CFATS of lessons\nthat were learned from those facilities that now have a lower\ntier or tiered out of the program?\nMr. Harrell. So we pride ourselves on doing a lot of\noutreach. We are very transparent with some of the things that\nwe have done well over the years. And so in terms of going\naround the country and engaging with facilities and engaging\nwith trade associations, we are talking about these industry\nbest practices and some of these physical security mitigation\nmeasures that industry has implement over the years.\nSo do I have a document to point to? No, not necessarily.\nBut there are conversations that are happening on almost a\ndaily basis about what good security looks like, and I think we\nhave been able to convey that to the industry at large.\nSenator Peters. So you are having informal conversations,\nbut it does not sound like there is any systemic way of\nactually compiling data to look at facilities that are at\nreduced risk and then provide some of that data to other\nfacilities?\nMr. Harrell. In terms of data, I think this is probably an\nopportunity for improvement for us.\nSenator Peters. Is that something you will consider going\nforward? Is that something we need to be engaged in here?\nMr. Harrell. No, indeed. As a matter of fact, it is ongoing\nas we speak now. As we move forward, I think it is incumbent\nupon us as a mature program to push out these industry best\npractices to what reduces risk for not only the regulated\ncommunity but also the non-regulated community as well. The\n30,000 facilities that are out there that we do not necessarily\ntouch now, they may not be high risk, but they are not no risk.\nAnd so there is an opportunity to engage them as to what good\nsecurity looks like and provide that road map.\nSenator Peters. A good security format is that we want to\nreduce the security risk, so it is good to get folks into lower\ntiers. So that should be a focus of your efforts. You would\nagree with that?\nMr. Harrell. Indeed.\nSenator Peters. That is a good thing.\nMr. Harrell. Yes.\nSenator Peters. We need to step up those efforts.\nMr. Harrell. Yes.\nSenator Peters. Great. Thank you.\nMr. Harrell. Thank you.\nChairman Johnson. Senator Carper.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CARPER\nSenator Carper. Thanks. Sorry to arrive late, and I know\nsome other of our colleagues will arrive eventually.\nSenator Tom Coburn and I, I think we were Chair and Ranking\nMember of this Committee when we worked on CFATS\nreauthorization. Actually, it might have been authorization. I\nthink it was earlier. It was not actually authorized, but I\nthink it was maybe included in an appropriations bill. But we\nworked on it, and we did a pretty good model of bipartisan\ncooperation, which we always like to do, but my recollection is\nthat we made a number of changes and improvements to the law in\norder to address, on the one hand, the backlog of inspections\nof the facilities across the country, and also ensure that DHS\nand also the industry being regulated had the kind of certainty\nthat they needed in order to make investments in securing\nchemical facilities.\nI would just ask, Mr. Anderson, you are representing GAO.\nIs that correct?\nMr. Anderson. Yes, sir.\nSenator Carper. And, Mr. Harrell, I understand you are here\nrepresenting DHS. Is that correct?\nMr. Harrell. Yes, sir.\nSenator Carper. I am going to ask both of you sort of the\nsame question. Nobody back 5 years ago thought the law was\nperfect, and the idea is to find out what works, do more of\nthat. And if it is not perfect, make it better. So we knew it\nwas not perfect, so the idea is to make it better, and my hope\nis that this conversation today will help us to do that.\nIn the spirit of if it is not perfect make it better, I\nunderstand that GAO has issued a number of recommendations to\nDHS regarding improvements to the program. Mr. Anderson, if you\ncould just talk a little bit about maybe some of those\nrecommendations, and then I am going to ask you, Mr. Harrell,\nif either you or maybe both of you could talk about how DHS has\nresponded to those recommendations. And, finally, is there more\nwork to be done? And my guess is the answer is probably yes.\nMr. Anderson, do you want to lead us off?\nMr. Anderson. Happy to lead off. We have issued 12\nrecommendations over the last 7 years. Ten have been\nimplemented, and they speak to identifying high-risk\nfacilities, better prioritizing them, and then reviewing and\napproving facility site security plans.\nThe two areas that we believe are outstanding and do demand\nattention, first is performance measurement. And as I said in\nmy opening remarks, this sounds bureaucratic, but it really\nspeaks to how the program should exist, how in that risk\nequation of threat, vulnerability, and consequence do we know\nthat these security measures that the CFATS program puts in\nplace are actually reducing vulnerability? A lot of the big\nfacilities, they have a security posture in place where they\nmight be high consequence and, therefore, get a real high risk\nrating. But they have already got those security measures in\nplace, so it is not the CFATS program that is reducing that\nthreat of a terrorist attack. It is some of the smaller ones in\nmany cases that maybe, would not have a perimeter fence or\nwould not have video surveillance but for the requirements of\nthe program.\nIn that situation, then perhaps if it is the CFATS program\ncoming in and recommending or requiring that security posture,\nthere has been a reduction in vulnerability. We feel at GAO\nthat that is where the program needs to improve. It is called\nan ``outcome measure.'' What is the outcome of that investment\nin the CFATS program?\nThe second area is with information sharing for first\nresponders, and that was from our most recent report as well,\nthat in many cases the Local Emergency Planning Committees\n(LEPCs), did not have the information or did not have access to\nthe information to know what kind of chemicals were present in\nan area when they were responding to an event.\nSenator Carper. Mr. Harrell.\nMr. Harrell. Thank you, Senator, for the question.\nSenator Carper. Do you agree with anything he said?\nMr. Harrell. We are very focused on metrics and\naccountability, and we have spent a lot of----\nSenator Carper. I am sorry. Very focused on metrics, did\nyou say?\nMr. Harrell. Metrics, yes. This program has over the last\nnumber of years really driven, I think, a lot of the physical\nsecurity protective measures within industry. And these\nmeasures are contributing to risk reduction. Well, now the\nquestion, the logical question, is: Prove it. Do not tell me\nabout it, but show me. Right?\nAnd so in going forward in coordination with the GAO\nreport, we are trying to move our metrics and our\nresponsibility toward proving the fact that we have done risk\nreduction. And so we think that comes through engaging with the\nfacility and talking about from the moment in which you started\nCFATS and you had just kind of a regular security program, to\nnow implementing the measures within CFATS, how has risk been\nreduced? What measures have you put in place that have\nquantitatively reduced risk?\nAnd so we are trying to take that data, compile it, and\nmeasure with it, and I think that is one of the new things that\nreally should be back to this Committee, is, again, expressing\nthe fact that we have done risk reduction.\nRight now we have measured that over the last number of\nyears we have had a number of facilities increase their\nsecurity measures by 55 percent, and we are certainly willing\nto kind of walk through that number with this Committee as to\nhow we have gotten to that. But we think it is important,\nmoving forward, that we measure this, and I think it is a sign\nof a mature program. That is what I am committed to doing.\nSenator Carper. Anybody else want to comment on this\nexchange and what was said or not said? Speak now or forever\nhold your peace.\nMr. Erny. Maybe I will just say just a few things.\nInformation availability, this is an issue that sort of spans\nacross multiple statutory authorities and regulatory agencies,\nand with involuntary programs, etc. In fact, DHS, Brian, I do\nnot think you mentioned anything about your Internet Protocol\n(IP) Gateway. A great tool that is available today where,\nfolks, members of the LEPCs and others can gain access to\ncritical information about sites, CFATS sites, and chemicals in\ntheir community.\nBut the thing that I want to stress with this is you have\nto balance the need for information and transparency and\nsecurity, and I think it is always kind of that tough line that\nwe are trying to reach as to what is the right balance here. So\nI would just caution everybody when we talk about making more\ninformation available to more people, the whole issue around\nneed to know is really important?\nSenator Carper. OK. Yes, Mister--is it Fridley?\nMr. Fridley. Yes, sir.\nSenator Carper. Hi, Mr. Fridley.\nMr. Fridley. Just a little piggyback on Bill's comment. The\noutreach, I think we do as good a job as we can, and obviously\nit has been getting better with the CFATS DHS inspectors' help.\nThey do a lot of the coordination for us. They know who are the\nplayers. We do really big live exercises with different\nagencies. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), we involve\nthe Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTF). We involve, you know,\nATF. We involved Transportation Security Administration\nofficers. We do not publicize this nor do they, but we offer up\nour facilities on a regular basis for them to come in to do\ntheir drills as well as our drills.\nSo there is a lot of coordination, I think, that goes out\nthat does not necessarily get communicated out. So we are\ndealing with the right people. It is just not publicized.\nSenator Carper. OK. Good. Anyone else?\nMr. Wright. Yes, thank you, Senator. I want to reiterate\nwhat Bill is saying. I think it is a balance, and there are\nlots of other statutes and agencies that deal with sharing of\nthis type of information. As Senator Johnson said in his\nopening, we need to keep CFATS focused on the terrorism issue.\nThere are lots of other statutes, lots of other agencies that\ncan do this. I know that my industry, we work very hard--and\nother industries----\nSenator Carper. What is your industry?\nMr. Wright. I work with the terminals, sir, the storage\nfacilities that you see at ports particularly. But we work very\nhard and it is in our interest to see that the local first\nresponders know what we have and know how to deal with it. So\nwe do that.\nBut in the CFATS context, the whole purpose of CFATS is to\nkeep information close to the people who are trained to deal\nwith it, the people who are committed to keeping it secret,\nbecause we go through this exercise, and that information about\ndangerous chemicals or vulnerabilities to facilities, we have\nsort of turned the thing on its head. And so, it is very\ncritical that we keep--and I think we have done a good job of\nthis, and I think certainly DHS has done a good job with this,\nis to keep the information to the number and kinds of people\nwith the right training who can deal with it.\nAnd so if there is a problem, maybe it is another statute,\nmaybe it is another agency that ought to be dealing with it.\nBut I feel that industry is doing a very good job because it is\nin the industry's interest.\nChairman Johnson. In other words, you want to keep your\nsecurity plans out of the hands of terrorists.\nMr. Wright. That is correct.\nChairman Johnson. Mr. Harrell, you wanted to comment on\nsomething?\nMr. Harrell. Yes. Thank you again for the question. So\ninformation sharing I think is absolutely critical to not only\nthe facility but also first responders, and I say this as a\nformer law enforcement officer. We need to strike that nice\nbalance between getting the information to first responders and\nthen also not providing that blueprint for attack. I think that\nis kind of what we all necessarily can agree on up here. But\nCFATS requires facilities currently to make contact with first\nresponders during the facility's security planning. This is\nfound under Risk-based Performance Standard No. 9.\nSo we have made concerted efforts over the last year as a\nresponse to the GAO audit to engage our Local Emergency\nPlanning Committees. As a matter of fact, in 2018 we engaged\n570, which is a pretty significant number. Over the last 5\nyears, we have actually engaged every single LEPC that is\nactive in the United States. So I think we are doing a very\ngood job of engaging those local first responders and providing\nthem the things that they need to know so that when things go\nbump in the night or something happens, they have and are armed\nwith the information to properly respond.\nChairman Johnson. I think it was Mr. Anderson's testimony\nthat said there was--you did take a look at use of the IP\nGateway.\nMr. Anderson. Yes.\nChairman Johnson. And the local responders had access to\nthat? I am highly concerned about having that information\navailable, but it is in a secured channel with a properly\nsecured gateway. Local responders should be looking at that.\nWhat is the disconnect here?\nMr. Anderson. Two data points that may be relevant to the\ndiscussion here. Thirteen of 15 LEPCs that we spoke with did\nnot have access to IP Gateway, so they did not know how to\nnavigate it. Put that on one side. Seven of 11 other LEPCs we\nspoke with did not realize they had CFATS-covered facilities in\ntheir jurisdiction. So part of this is communication, and part\nof this is education. But we did see some pretty big gaps in\nterms of information sharing with first responders as of August\n2018.\nChairman Johnson. I would think that would be pretty easy\nto take care of. You have how many total CFATS-regulated\ncompanies? How many thousand?\nMr. Anderson. High risk, 3,500. Total, 30,000.\nChairman Johnson. Those 3,500 that DHS just says you have\nto contact your local fire department and make them aware that\nyou are there and that here is your secure password into this\nIP Gateway. I would think that would be pretty simple. Again, a\nlittle lowly plastics manufacturer, our fire department knew\neverything about our operation. So what is happening with local\nlaw enforcement?\nMr. O'Brien. Senator Johnson, just to add our perspective\nfrom the explosives industry, by ATF law we have to engage the\nlocal fire and first responders. So every facility covered by\nCFATS that is an ATF-regulated facility already has to engage\nlocal law enforcement and first responders.\nChairman Johnson. I will kick it over to you, Mr. Harrell.\nDo you have an answer to why law enforcement did not even know\nabout the CFATS facilities or why not a one that were surveyed\nhad access to the IP Gateway.\nMr. Harrell. I think we are still very intent on engaging\nlocal law enforcement, LEPCs. This is an iterative process.\nThis is us going and pinging them, constantly talking about our\ntools. Some of them are overtaxed. Some of them are running\nfrom call to call and do not necessarily have the resources and\ndo not necessarily have the full situational awareness that we\noffer these things. I think it is incumbent upon us to engage\nearly and often to remind them that we have these tools, and,\noh, by the way, they are free. And so we are committed to that.\nChairman Johnson. OK. Again, my experience with, fire\ndepartments, they are waiting in between fire calls, and this\nis what they do in between that, is they visit different sites\nso they are prepared.\nMr. Harrell, you talked about operating systems. I am a\nlittle concerned about hearing you talk about operating\nsystems. Can you tell me what you are talking about, CFATS\nprogram looking at operating systems?\nMr. Harrell. Sure. The Risk-based Performance Standard No.\n8, which is cybersecurity, if you read the language today it is\na little bit antiquated. I think there is an opportunity for\nimprovement here to revisit that language, refresh it, and\nreally focus on today's cybersecurity threats when it comes to\nnot only corporate systems but also industrial control systems.\nAnd so I think we really need to understand the threat, and we\nhave seen this threat in terms of industrial control systems\nand, nation-state adversaries trying to exploit this overseas,\nand we do not want that to happen here.\nChairman Johnson. Cybersecurity is an incredibly complex\nand an unbelievably large issue here. The President's budget\ncalls for a reduction and basically calls for it because your\nright-sizing the industry for today's threat. First of all, do\nyou agree with that statement of the President's budget?\nMr. Harrell. Well, so CFATS resides in the Cybersecurity\nand Infrastructure Security Agency----\nChairman Johnson. I understand, so should cybersecurity and\nlooking at operational controls of chemical facilities, do you\nreally think that should be within the purview or within the\njurisdiction of the CFATS program?\nMr. Harrell. As it currently is written, and I would\ncontinue this today, that is, there are certain industry best\npractices, things that we should be doing to safeguard our\nsystems, having a phishing plan, understanding insider threats,\ndoing the basic cyber hygiene that every company should be\ndoing. And so, yes, the answer is yes. I think from a risk-\nbased performance standard we should continue to at a high\nlevel look at cybersecurity.\nChairman Johnson. OK. Anybody in industry want to comment\non that?\nMr. Fridley. We actually utilize a lot of the resources\nthat DHS provides us for our information technology (IT). I am\nnot an IT person, but I have put them in contact with our IT.\nChairman Johnson. That is DHS, that is CISA's\nresponsibility, not necessarily CFATS.\nMr. Fridley. But I am using the CFATS portal to be able to\nmake the right contacts. I just do not have the infinite\nknowledge of who is all who, so they definitely play a role in\nthat. But we actually work with a lot of things as far as\nlooking at pulling certain things off our business network that\nare not core to our business and putting them on separate\nnetworks, to kind of keep that delineation between the\ndifferent attacks that could happen.\nChairman Johnson. Using CFATS as your portal to get to the\nexperts at CISA in terms of plugging into National Institute of\nStandards and Technology (NIST) standards or whatever, that\ndoes not bother me. Where I get a little concerned is if all of\na sudden CFATS is going to set up its own little cybersecurity\ndirectorate to audit and consult with chemical facilities in\nterms of your operating systems and how to prevent cyber\nattacks. I am questioning that right now.\nMr. Fridley. We actually get inspected from our cyber\nstandpoint from, RBPS 8 that Brian was talking about, and we\nactually had the inspectors come and get with our IT folks to\nkind of go through and do that cleanse.\nChairman Johnson. Which inspectors?\nMr. Fridley. The CFATS inspectors.\nChairman Johnson. On cyber?\nMr. Fridley. Yes, sir.\nChairman Johnson. This is different from the roundtable we\nhad last year on cyber.\nMr. Fridley. We have a corporate approach for our cyber, so\nthey send their cyber experts to our facility, our\nheadquarters, and they did the whole inspection process with\nour director of cybersecurity.\nChairman Johnson. OK.\nSenator Peters. I will interject. I mean, it is clear, I\nthink, Mr. Harrell, you mentioned the attack on a plant now is\nnot going to be a truck driving through the gate. It is likely\nto be a cyber attack in some way and that is why cybersecurity\nis an important part of what you do. Is that correct?\nMr. Harrell. It is, yes, 100 percent.\nSenator Peters. And would all of you agree that we are\nthinking about with CFATS?\n[Witnesses nodding heads.]\nGreat. Thank you.\nMr. Harrell. If you do not mind, sir, one of the things I\nwould just add to that is, I would really refrain from looking\nat this through the silos of physical security, cybersecurity,\nand industrial controls. Today we are seeing blended attacks.\nWe are seeing that hybrid threat. And so it is incredibly\nimportant that we look at this from a convergence perspective\nto understand that what happens on the physical side can\ncertainly have a cyber implication. And what happens on the\ncyber side can have a physical implication.\nIP-based cameras, access control systems, they are all\nInternet-facing today, and we do not want that to be the enemy\navenue of approach on the physical security side to get into\nsome of the key cyber systems. So I think we need to have a\nfull understanding across the entire threat landscape.\nSenator Peters. Everyone agree with that? Any other\nopinions on that?\nMr. Erny. Maybe I will just add a couple of thoughts. I do\nnot disagree with that; for sure there needs to be a focus, a\ncyber-related focus when it comes to the CFATS program.\nHowever, it needs to be a focused approach to this, and I think\nfor the most part, my understanding listening to members, that\nDHS has done that. But there is a continuing concern of this\nthing expanding out. We are looking at things like ransomware\nand some of these other cyber-related issues that we see today.\nSome of this gets blended in with more of sort of what you\nwould consider to be sort of a traditional attack on a chemical\nfacility through a cyber means.\nI think the one way to look at it and the way we try to\ndefine it in our membership is: Can a cyber means be used to\ninstitute a physical release or a physical theft of chemicals\nof interest? And so I would just ask DHS that as long as you\nmaintain a focus on cyber as it applies to CFATS, I think that\nis appropriate.\nThe one last thing I will say about this issue is we have\nother agencies dipping their toes into cyber. We have the Coast\nGuard getting ready to release some cyber guidance through\ntheir Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circulars (NVIC)\nprocess. Customs and Border Protection just added a lot of\ncyber-related, and they are not all the same.\nAnd so one of the issues here with the companies is just\ngetting overwhelmed by all these different agencies----\nChairman Johnson. That is my concern.\nMr. Erny [continuing]. Different approaches around\ncybersecurity. That is a real concern.\nChairman Johnson. It is the concern I am expressing right\nnow. Listen, there is no doubt about it that cyber attacks,\nthat cybersecurity is a threat to every business particularly\nin this sphere. What you do not want is you do not want every\none of your alphabet soup agencies with a whole new cyber\nstandard and their cyber inspection team and that type of\nthing. I can certainly see every agency being a portal to a\nunified approach how we go about doing this. Now, the unified\napproach may be to an Industry Sector Advisory Committee (ISAC)\nwithin a particular industry where you try and get like-minded,\nsimilar types of industries working at the problems because\nthey have some similarities there, like the Financial Systemic\nAnalysis and Resilience Center (FSARC) or whatever. I have a\nreal concern when one program within a larger agency is taking\nthe whole cybersecurity issue on its own back and trying to\ndevelop the processes and the expertise and that type of thing,\ndo full audits and, here is the program, this is what you have\nto comply with; if you do not comply with it, here is your\nfine. That is where I start having some real concern. Mr.\nHarrell, if that makes sense to you.\nMr. Harrell. Actually, it does, and our commitment to you\nis that, we will reduce those redundancies amongst regulation.\nWe do not want that same scenario that you just described. And\nso as we go down that road, potentially, the onus is on us to\nensure that does not happen.\nChairman Johnson. And you may take that attitude. The\nfellow or gal that follows you may not. Again, I think Congress\nhas done a pretty poor job of actually writing law that directs\nthese agencies. We write these little frameworks to have the\nagencies go about and become their own little fiefdoms. So as\nwe reauthorize this thing, I am going to try and do as best as\npossible to keep CFATS within its little box doing its thing\nand hopefully doing it really well and doing it really\nefficiently and, rewarding the good actors here.\nSenator Peters. I will just say, Mr. Chairman, when you say\nkeep it in a box and silos, we have way too many silos right\nnow when it comes to this. And when you have cyber, we have to\nbe able to break down silos and make sure the communication is\nthere to really have a whole-of-society impact so that folks\nfrom DHS or Coast Guard or wherever are also assisting private\nindustry to safeguard assets, too. We have to come together. I\ndo not think this is just strictly a regulatory regime. It is\nalso a way to incorporate how we use some of the assets that we\nhave at the Federal Government to assist you in protecting your\nassets as well against the bad guys that are looking for the\nweakest link to get in. And if we do not do this in a\ncomprehensive way, we are not going to be successful. So that\nwill put my 2 cents in.\nChairman Johnson. I am not looking at silos in terms of\ninformation when we see a threat and, oh, we are just going to\nkeep that to ourselves. I am just talking about mission creep\nand having 16 ways on Sunday in terms of this is--no, you have\nto comply with cyber this way, no, you have to--again, you\nmentioned all the alphabet soups, and they are all giving you\nthe business, right? Because we all recognize this is a threat,\nwe cannot let this, I do not think, cyber to proliferate in\nterms of regulatory regimes. We have to try as best as possible\nunify this.\nOK. One thing, and I think this came across, and it is\nactually pretty pleasing to hear it in the last roundtable,\nthere does appear to be a pretty cooperative--and I think Mr.\nO'Brien may disagree with this, but, in general, there seems to\nbe a fair level of good cooperation between industry and DHS.\nThis seems to be one agency that, by and large, because Mr.\nO'Brien said opportunity to assist voluntarily. Is that pretty\naccurate?\nMr. Fridley. Yes, sir.\nChairman Johnson. I know you have your regulator sitting\nright next to you, but----\nMr. Fridley. He is one down. [Laughter.]\nChairman Johnson. One down. We kept it arm's length.\nMr. Wright. Senator, we think so. We think particularly\nafter the 2014 changes that we have had a very cooperative\nrelationship with DHS. We have been very pleased. But as this\nreauthorization process starts, we have the same concern that\nyou have.\nChairman Johnson. I know. You want clarity on that issue,\nand we will----\nMr. Wright. Exactly. On our narrow issue I do, but on the\nbroader issue, we just do not want to see mission creep here.\nWe want this program to remain focused on terrorism.\nChairman Johnson. OK. Anybody else want to comment?\nConfirm? Deny?\nMr. Fridley. Yes, I think that, obviously, at Brenntag we\nhave probably the most regulated facilities for the CFATS\nprogram in the country. So, we have a lot of conversations. Any\nquestions we have get answered. Any concerns we have, we may\nnot like the answer, but we get the answers back. They listen.\nIt is a team effort. It is one of the few, obviously, from the\nregulatory agencies that we have that relationship and actually\nthink we are being heard and valued.\nChairman Johnson. OK. Mr. O'Brien?\nMr. O'Brien. Thank you, Senator.\nChairman Johnson. Spill your guts. [Laughter.]\nMr. O'Brien. Actually, this may surprise you, but they have\nbeen amazingly receptive. The deficiency has been no\nrecognition of ATF in their mission and what they do. So that\nis the deficiency. But as an agency, I mean, I have to be fair\nand I have to be honest. They have been approachable. They have\ngiven answers. But there has been no justification for those\nanswers, and that is where we are really falling. Understand--\nwhy are we regulated for safety and security against terrorism\ntwice? And we cannot get those answers. But the people who come\nout have been nice, congenial.\nChairman Johnson. By the way, there is not a good answer\nfor it.\nMr. O'Brien. Might not be.\nChairman Johnson. Mr. Harrell, do you want to comment?\nMr. Harrell. Yes, we would love to. The intent really is to\nwork with all entities that are subject to compliance. This is\nnot a ``gotcha'' regulation. We pride ourselves on the outreach\nand the transparency and the willingness to help facilities\nreally across the board.\nThe program is designed to give facilities many chances to\ncome into compliance. Out of the 3,327 facilities that are\nregulated by CFATS, DHS has only taken five enforcement actions\non four facilities. One facility was actually fined twice. But\nthis represents less than 1 percent of the regulated\npopulation.\nSo, we are committed to--a rising tide lifts all boats. We\nwant to have the interaction back and forth. We are very\nflexible, and we want to have the conversation to where, at the\nend of the day, the facility becomes more secure. We are\ncommitted to that.\nChairman Johnson. So one of the things I am a big believer\nin--I was not always when running a small business, then I got\nbought by a bigger business, and I had to create one, when I\nreally found out the real value of developing a mission\nstatement. I asked staff, do we have a mission statement? Is it\nanywhere in law? And there really is not one for this. So I\nwould recommend as we reauthorize this stuff to develop a\nmission statement. If we need to clearly define some of these\nthings, we should do it. Let us take the opportunity right now,\nlet us lay out that mission statement. Let us try and get--\nbecause we have this cooperation and coordination. Let us get\nagreement within the industry this is what--everybody wants\nthis reauthorized. Fine. Under what mission statement? And if\nwe do a good job writing it--I am not talking about multiple\nparagraphs, multiple sentences. I am talking about something\npretty simple. The simpler, the better. Then if we need to look\nat some of these definitions of what a risky chemical is, a\nliquid that is flammable but explodable, and just try and get\nsome definition to bring everybody a little bit better clarity\nof what CFATS is all about, the regulators combined with the\nregulated, then I think we will have done a pretty good job as\nwe reauthorize this thing.\nSo let us bring clarity to this thing, let us bring\ncertainty to the business, while at the same time accomplishing\nwhat I consider is the primary goal here. Let us make sure we\nkeep chemicals out of the hands of terrorists and do not let\nthem fall into the wrong hands to be used for terrorist-type\nevents.\nAgain, I think it ought to be pretty simple to do these\nthings, so let us work together on that.\nI will give everybody an opportunity. We will start with\nMr. Morawetz, and if you have any comments that you cannot wait\nto get out?\nMr. Morawetz. Besides my written statement, I would just\nreiterate that we are a stakeholder like everybody else at this\ntable and this room. We think that we should be included in it.\nWithout that, I think you are losing a lot from it. In\nparticular, I agree about where the focus is, which is Appendix\nA, Chemicals, and that they are extremely hazardous substances.\nAnd we are only dealing with it in the realm of anti-terrorism,\nbut there is a lot that could be done on it.\nChairman Johnson. By the way, Mr. Morawetz. It is\ninteresting. When I was running a manufacturing plant, if I\nwanted to get answers, I did not go to management. I went to\npeople on the plant floor. So you are absolutely right. They\nare the ones that are actually implementing. Any smart\nmanagement, any smart regulator is going to get input from the\npeople that are actually doing the work on the shop floor. So\nwe are in complete agreement from that standpoint.\nMr. Morawetz. And my guess is most of the people at this\ntable involve their workforce.\nChairman Johnson. Mr. Wright.\nMr. Wright. Senator, just thank you for this opportunity.\nAs I say, we have a very specific issue, and we want Congress\nto exercise some oversight and to help give us some relief for\nwhat we consider to be a rather narrow problem. But beyond\nthat, we are very supportive of CFATS and very supportive of\nthe program, and we look forward to working with you as we get\ninto the reauthorization language. And thank you very much for\nyour comments today.\nChairman Johnson. Mr. Erny.\nMr. Erny. I would just say a few things. I like the focus\nand the attention that you are bringing to this issue. We stand\nready to help and support the Committee as needed. I think one\nof the more important things here is to make sure that we keep\nCFATS focused on anti-terrorism and chemical security, and I\nwould be very concerned with any wandering away into some other\nareas.\nAnyway, I look forward to working with your Committee.\nChairman Johnson. As a homework assignment, I would not be\nopposed to each of you writing up a no-more-than-two-sentence\nmission statement. I would be really interested in seeing\nsomething like that. If you have to go longer, I am just going\nto ignore it. No, I am just kidding. I think these things are\nbest when they are really focused. I have seen mission\nstatements that run on three pages. That is really not being\nsuccinct enough. Mr. O'Brien.\nMr. O'Brien. Thank you, Senator Johnson, for the\nopportunity to be here. A side note. My kids were thrilled that\nI actually was participating with a Senator. They had no idea\nthings like this happened in----\nChairman Johnson. Not that big a deal. [Laughter.]\nMr. O'Brien. I said, boy, when my kids think it is a big\ndeal, it must be a big deal. Daddy did something good.\nI appreciate the opportunity. It still confuses us why a\ngroup that is already regulated for safety and security against\nterrorism is falling under the CFATS program. It is the most\nobvious duplicative regulation we can see out there. When you\nlook around, we cannot find another one that is as obvious as\nthis. We still would love answers as to why we are continuing\nto be in this, because we have done our metrics. We do not see\nthe benefit for security that DHS is claiming. We do not know\nwhere they are getting those metrics from.\nSo the continued ask is please look at us as a regulated\ncommunity and look for that justification. If you are opening\nup the thing as to what ought to change? We are easy, double-\nregulation group.\nChairman Johnson. Well, as you are aware, I fixed that last\ntime, so you understand where I stand on that.\nMr. O'Brien. We appreciate your efforts, Senator.\nChairman Johnson. Mr. Fridley.\nMr. Fridley. Yes. With over 100 CFATS-regulated facilities,\nwe are looking to invest quite a bit of capital, and we are\njust looking for certainty on reauthorization. So we look\nforward to working with you, Ranking Member Peters, and both\nyour staffs on this regulation and get the reauthorization.\nChairman Johnson. I actually have a question for Mr.\nAnderson, because I think what you are asking for, a metric\nreduction vulnerability, I just think it is unanswerable and\nimmeasurable. So how do you do that? Or let us put it this way:\nvery difficult to.\nMr. Anderson. There are other analogs in Federal space, and\nI will point to the Coast Guard and to their MTSA and how they\nregulate and measure the effects of--I should say measure the\neffects of their efforts, for example, at port chemical\nfacilities. It is called the ``Maritime Security Risk Analysis\nModel (MSRAM),'' and to unpack that a little bit, what they\nwill do is they will go in and, based on that initial security\nvulnerability assessment, there will be a baseline of the\nsecurity posture. And then after additional measures are put in\nplace, even if it is somewhat back of the hand, say they have\ngone from a five in terms of vulnerability to a terrorist\nattack to a two, based on some perhaps subjective measure, but\nthere is usually alignment between some of those numerics and a\ngiven security posture. Then you are getting a better\nunderstanding for how much has vulnerability reduced as a\nfunction of these requirements. Otherwise, you and other\ndecisionmakers who are in a position to evaluate this program\ndo not have the information necessary to determine whether the\nbenefit is worth the cost.\nChairman Johnson. OK. You have answered my question. I\nunderstand what you are talking about. I think part of the\nproblem for DHS on that is if they have already brought people\nup to a standard--the good metrics have already been achieved,\nhopefully. Now what else are you going to measure? So, you are\nhere. Without further mission creep, without saying, ``well,\nbecause we have to improve our metrics now, OK, you met this\nstandard.'' It is like in my business, it is OK, you have the\none part per billion. Hey, how about two parts per trillion?\nBecause now we can measure it. Which, by the way, is exactly\nwhat is happening in industry as we get an ability to measure\nwith more precision. It has gone from parts per million to\nparts per billion. Now I am reading things like parts per\nbillion in terms of purity. Again, I am a little concerned\nabout a metric like that at this level at this point in time\nafter people have already been certified. How would they\nactually have an improved metric if you have already got people\nat a certification level?\nMr. Harrell, are you providing any scores on that? Is there\nany score right now in terms of facilities other than tier\nlevel?\nMr. Harrell. There is. As a matter of fact, we are focused\non from when you enter the program and your current State of\nsecurity program to where you finally come into compliance and\nyou have added some of these physical security protective\nmeasures in place. What is that score? What is that risk\nreduction? And we have been able to measure that, and we are\nhappy to supply----\nChairman Johnson. Isn't it just for GAO's purposes, just a\nmatter of accumulating all that data on 3,500 companies?\nMr. Harrell. I believe it is.\nMr. Anderson. I would say there is a little bit of the\ndevil is in the details. The information that we have gotten\nfrom DHS is on risk, writ large. We are talking about the\nvulnerability variable between threat plus vulnerability plus\nconsequence. So you could reduce risk by, reducing consequence.\nOr you could better measure risk or have a risk score based on\na high-consequence event. But it is really vulnerability that\nwe are after here. We are trying to reduce the vulnerability of\nfacilities to a terrorist attack. That needs to be measured.\nThere are analogs in Federal space. While it is difficult,\nother mature programs have gotten there, and I would be happy\nto unpack the MSRAM model for DHS.\nChairman Johnson. I would like to keep talking--let me\nthrow one out. How would you measure this one? After 9/11, I\nthink the most significant security measure we took is we\nhardened the cockpits. How do you put a score on that? I think\nit dramatically increased security in our airspace. But how\nwould you ever measure that? Other than we did it. This was\nobvious. Just kind of like meeting the standards of what CFATS\ncertification is, you have done it. So we will have this--we do\nneed to have this conversation because I am just not quite\ngetting measurement. I do want these agencies to concentrate on\nactually certifying and responding and cooperating with the\nagencies to make things safe as opposed to spending a lot of\ntime measuring the unanswerable. So you have to do a little\nmore convincing, at least to me.\nMr. Anderson. I am happy to, and I do have more to say, but\nI am thinking the conversation is pivoting away from this at\nthe moment.\nChairman Johnson. Well, we should probably do this in my\nconference room or whatever with staff. Because, I am\nintrigued. That is why I am asking the question. I am an\naccountant. I love data. I like to measure things. But\nsometimes, again----\nMr. Anderson. But it also underscores your point. It does\nunderscore that perhaps the program needs to change. If you\nhave gotten to this high baseline already for a given security\nposture, then maybe you argue at that point that the hard work\nhas been done. Now the program needs to shift from one of\nchecking internal controls.\nChairman Johnson. Mr. Harrell, do you have anything just\nburning----\nMr. Harrell. Just our commitment to evolving the program,\nnot only with you but this Committee. We recognize that the\nprogram should be focused on risk reduction and active\nintelligence. The threat has evolved, and so should we. And we\nare committed to this body, the industry, and, we want to be a\npartner in a long-term policy solution.\nChairman Johnson. OK. Well, let me underscore how important\nit is that you maintain the attitude you have right now with\nthe people you are regulating that you have been cooperative. I\nthink that is pretty rare in the Federal Government, so I am\nglad to be conducting the oversight over a program and agency\nthat has that type of seal of approval from your regulator,\nthose that you regulate. It is a real feather in the cap to all\nyour personnel, so thank them personally from me.\nMr. Harrell. Yes, sir, I will.\nChairman Johnson. Make sure you maintain it. That should be\na prime goal of the organization, is to maintain that level of\ncooperation that is in reality that you really are cooperating.\nOne suggestion for doing that is listening. Where you have\nduplication like ATF, support a reform that in a way does not\njeopardize national security, and helps reduce the regulatory\nburden. Those businesses that have International Organization\nfor Standardization (ISO) certification or, other regulatory\nagencies that are keeping you up to snuff, they have already\nmet your certification and potentially surpassed it, reward\nthem with less of a regulatory burden. I think that not only\nwould demonstrate that you have an attitude toward cooperation,\nbut in the end you will actually modify things based on the\nreality and you will continue to cooperate with the industries\nthat you regulate.\nAgain, hats off to you and everybody within the CFATS\nprogram for, first of all, creating that atmosphere where you\nreally do have people that appreciate the fact you have that\ncooperation and just lay that in as just an ongoing culture\nwithin your agency.\nMr. Harrell. Thank you.\nChairman Johnson. Anybody have any last thoughts based on\nthat?\n[No response.]\nSpeak now, or you have to do it in the conference room\nlater. [Laughter.]\nThis hearing record will remain open for 15 days until June\n19 at 5 p.m. for the submission of statements and questions for\nthe record.

CHUCK GRASSLEY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM\nIOWA, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON FINANCE\nThe Chairman. I welcome everybody to today's hearing on\nforeign threats to taxpayer-funded research. Normally I do not\nstart until Senator Wyden gets here, but he said we could go\nahead and he will be here shortly. Also, another reason for\nstarting on time is because we have some votes that are going\nto interfere with exactly how much of this committee's work I\ndo not know, so we want to keep it moving.\nTaxpayer-funded research has been integral in keeping\nAmerica's medical, defense, information technology, and many\nother products at the forefront of our world's market. Simply\nsaid, the United States is the best of the best when it comes\nto conducting cutting-edge medical research. Our scientists\npush the envelope to make crucial discoveries and better\nproducts, whether it is vaccines or medical treatments\ngenerally, and they all fall into the category of great\ndevelopment of the intellectual property.\nThese projects can produce important breakthroughs for\npatients and industry, for the United States, and the entire\nworld. We did not develop this reputation overnight. We earned\nit through the persistent hard work and dedication of\nresearchers across the country.\nI would like to call that a good old-fashioned American\nwork ethic. I thank them for their service to our country. I\nwant them to know that this committee's oversight is not\ndesigned to interfere with the pursuit of knowledge and the\nfree exchange of information by researchers. Rather, this\ncommittee's oversight is intended to strengthen the integrity\nof taxpayer-funded research, and especially to preserve our\nvaluable work product. Truly free collaboration and exchange of\ninformation is only possible when data and sources are credible\nand the research process can be trusted.\nThat trust is destroyed when foreign governments or other\nentities interfere in our research for their gain and to our\ndetriment. Accordingly, Congress, the executive branch, and\nresearch institutions must work together to properly balance\nthe robust development and exchange of ideas in the research\nfield with reasonable and proportionate common-sense efforts to\nprotect the integrity of the research.\nThat is why I have engaged in oversight efforts in this\nfield. Beginning in October of last year, I wrote to the\nNational Institutes of Health, the Department of Health and\nHuman Services, and the Health and Human Services Inspector\nGeneral about threats to taxpayer-funded research. Since then,\nI have also written to the National Science Foundation and the\nDepartment of Defense.\nToday we will focus on foreign threats to research funded\nby the National Institutes of Health, its granting process, and\ndownstream grantees. Those threats include spying, theft of\nintellectual property, the disclosure of confidential\ninformation, and other related efforts that undermine the\nintegrity of research. The National Institutes of Health spend\n$39 billion of taxpayer money each year on medical research.\nSo the American people have worked hard for that money, and\nthe people deserve to know how the government is working to\nprotect that research and the resulting intellectual property\nfrom foreign threats.\nWe know that China is by far the most prolific offender.\nHowever, they are not the only country acting against our\ninterests. In October 2018, while chairman of the Judiciary\nCommittee, I held a hearing on China's non-traditional\nespionage against the United States. During that hearing, I\nbroached the issue of China's focus on our research\ninstitutions and taxpayer-funded research. Today we can get\ninto more detail regarding the threats. It is without dispute\nthat China has focused its energy on leveraging our hard work\nfor their benefit, and of course to our detriment.\nOne example hits home for me. In 2011, Chinese nationals\ntried to steal genetically modified corn seeds from an Iowa\nfield. They tried to ship that seed back to China. Those seeds\nwere the product of years of research and development. The\nChinese Government says that they are, quote, ``picking flowers\nin foreign lands to make honey in China,'' end of quote. And of\ncourse we believe them.\nWhether we are talking about Confucius Institutes'\nspreading propaganda on college campuses, China's ``Talent\nPrograms'' that are being called ``brain gain'' programs, or\nChina planting spies in our industries, the Government of China\nis a serious problem. In 2013, Chinese nationals were charged\nwith conspiring to steal research funded by a multi-million-\ndollar NIH grant for the benefit of the Chinese Government and\na direct competitor of the American university where the\nresearch was conducted.\nIn an August 20, 2018, letter to NIH grantee institutions,\nNIH called attention to a series of threats posed by foreign\nentities to the integrity of U.S. biomedical research. In that\nletter, NIH warned that foreign actors have ``mounted\nsystematic programs to influence NIH researchers and peer\nreviewers,'' may have worked to divert intellectual property\nproduced by NIH-supported research to other countries, and may\nhave contributed resources to NIH-funded researchers in ways\nthat could impact the integrity of that research.\nIn January of this year, the HHS Inspector General notified\nme that NIH recently made 12 referrals in this area to the\nInspector General. Those referrals primarily involved principal\ninvestigators--essentially the prime researchers--on NIH grants\nconducting medical research at U.S. universities. Those\nresearchers allegedly failed to meet NIH requirements to\ndisclose foreign affiliations on their grant applications,\nwhich turns out to be a very serious problem. Researchers who\nare secretly supported by a foreign government while working in\nour research projects can be more susceptible to the influence\nand control of the foreign parent.\nWe must know who is financially supporting researchers to\nbetter understand whether they might be more dedicated to\nsecuring the interests of an adversary than to rigorous\nscientific and medical advancement. Our witnesses can speak to\nthose specific threats and the government's capability to\ndetect and deter them.\nToday we have witnesses from the National Institutes of\nHealth, the Health and Human Services Office of National\nSecurity, the Health and Human Services Inspector General, and\nthe Department of Homeland Security.\nNow you can see an empty chair at the table. The FBI was\ninvited by the committee, given that they are a critical aspect\nof counterintelligence in this field. The committee invited the\nFBI April 30th. That is 26 business days before the hearing\ndate.\nOn May 6th, the FBI said that it would be unable to\nparticipate in the hearing, but failed to explain why. My staff\nfollowed up via email and phone. On May 7th, the FBI reiterated\nthat they were not able to appear, but again failed to explain\nwhy. On May 16th, the FBI responded via email and said the\n``Counterintelligence Division respectfully declines the\nhearing invite,'' yet again failing to explain why.\nOn May 23rd, I wrote a letter to the FBI again inviting\ntheir attendance. On May 29th, the FBI responded in writing and\nstated that it ``does not have a witness available to attend\nthe hearing and the briefing.''\nAfter just about 1 month of communications between the FBI\nand my staff, the FBI failed at every turn to explain why the\nentire Counterintelligence Division did not have a single\nemployee available to attend today's hearings. That is\ninexcusable and, quite frankly, it is a shame because of their\nresponsibilities. What a wasted opportunity for the FBI to\nexplain to this committee and the American people what they are\ndoing to help these agencies detect and deter threats to our\nresearch. The American people deserve more than a stiff arm\nfrom the FBI. However, I appreciate the cooperation of expert\nwitnesses who are here today, and I look forward to a robust\nconversation.\nGenerally speaking, there are four main issues related to\ntaxpayer-funded research.\nFirst, the failure to disclose. Some researchers hired to\nwork on U.S. research projects have not disclosed that they\nhave received financial contributions from foreign countries.\nNumber two, espionage. Some researchers are spies, and\ntheir only purpose is to infiltrate taxpayer-funded research\nprojects to steal intellectual property and bring it to their\nhome country.\nThird is vetting. The Federal Government does not vet all\nresearchers hired by U.S. institutions to work on taxpayer-\nfunded research, and neither do the institutions.\nLastly, the issue of integrity. Some peer reviewers have\nshared confidential information from grant applications with\nforeign governments which would allow them to potentially skip\nresearch steps. Some have also attempted to influence funding\ndecisions, undermining the integrity of this taxpayer-funded\nresearch.\nThese threats to our research are ongoing, aggressive, and\nreal. The question is: does the government have the capability\nto detect threats, combat threats, and determine how to protect\nour research and any financial intellectual property created\nfrom that research?\nToday is an opportunity for our witnesses to engage in a\nfrank discussion about what that threat is and what we in\nCongress and the executive branch can do all together to solve\nthe problem.\nSo the two branches must be on the same page. So if you\nbelieve that there are legislative and policy solutions that\nwill assist you with your already difficult jobs, now is the\ntime to bring them forward. And I hope you can do that at this\nhearing.\nI look forward to a robust discussion today on these\nmatters. After this morning's hearing, the committee will then\nmove this afternoon to a classified briefing on the same\nsubject matter. I strongly encourage the witnesses to take\nadvantage of the highly classified environment to provide as\nmuch information to the committee as possible.\nWhen Ranking Member Wyden gets here, I will call on him,\nand now I will introduce the witnesses.\n[The prepared statement of Chairman Grassley appears in the\nappendix.]\nThe Chairman. I just called on you. Are you ready?\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RON WYDEN,\nA U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON\nSenator Wyden. I am. Mr. Chairman, you are ever gracious,\nand I thank you and always appreciate the chance to work\ntogether.\nJust a couple of points I would like to make as we begin\nthis morning's inquiry. Our country is more entrepreneurial,\nour economy is stronger, and our lives are better because the\nscientific community in America is able to attract so many of\nthe world's brightest minds. That is a strength to be\nprotected, a part of our national security that we must always\nbolster.\nForeign-born scientists put Americans on the moon. They\nworked for the Manhattan Project. Nearly a third of all\nAmerican Nobel Laureates were born outside the United States.\nIf you look back at 2016, that year six U.S.-based scientists\nwon Nobel Prizes. There were many born in other countries.\nIt goes without saying that individuals and governments\noutside the United States are always going to be out there\nlooking at chipping away at our lead. That is particularly true\nwhen it comes to scientific breakthroughs that lead to valuable\nIP and entrepreneurship. Academic institutions and other\nresearch organizations based in this country must understand\nthis, and must respond to those concerns just like Federal\nagencies and private companies do.\nBut let us be careful not to over-reach with barriers that\nturn away bright students, or cut off lines of communication\nwith scientists from other countries that can end up doing more\nharm than good. And targeting Americans who happen to be\ndescendants of recent immigrants in my view would just be a\nmajor mistake.\nDr. Verita Currie, a distinguished professor at Iowa State\nUniversity, put it this way, and I will quote: ``Without\nforeign-born researchers, the entire system of higher education\nin the United States would collapse in a minute.''\nThis morning we are going to hear from Dr. Joe Gray of our\nvery own Oregon Health and Science University. I had a chance\nto visit with Dr. Gray yesterday, and nobody knows better than\nhe how vitally important foreign-born researchers and\ninternational collaboration are to America and to American\ninstitutions. Our country would not be able to achieve some of\nthe scientific breakthroughs without them, period.\nSecond, all breakthroughs in medicine or technology are to\nbe cheered as long as they result in better lives for the\nAmerican people. And if our country suspects that American IP\nor technology is being stolen, is being ripped off from us, we\nhave the power to do something about it.\nFinally, while the committee examines the issues today, it\nis also important to take a step back to look at the broader\ncontext of our commitment to scientific research. When you take\ninflation into account, Federal investments in science and\nresearch have unfortunately been declining, and declining\nsteadily for decades.\nState investments in higher education have also dropped,\nwhich in a lot of instances can end up really almost starving\nresearch universities of the funds they need. The quickest way\nto turn the lights out in healthy research laboratories across\nAmerica, in my view, would be to actually enact into law the\nTrump administration's proposed cuts to the National Institutes\nof Health.\nA few months ago the President also signed an executive\norder threatening to cut off research funding for universities,\nin my view over an unwarranted panic dealing with speech on\ncampus. Fortunately, the order was toothless.\nSo when you take the broader view of threats to research in\nAmerica, it is clear that we have substantial dangers from\nwithin, and too often they stem from the administration taking\nanti-science positions.\nWith regard to foreign threats, what is true with private\nbusinesses and government agencies is true for research\ninstitutions. They can and must take responsible steps to\nprotect themselves. I intend to work with all of my colleagues\non both sides of the aisle to ensure that they have the tools\nto do so. But I also do not want to close the door or place\nundue burdens on foreign-born students and scientists who can\nmake life-changing discoveries because they work together with\nAmericans.\nMr. Chairman, I look forward to working with you and\nappreciate the chance to be here.\n[The prepared statement of Senator Wyden appears in the\nappendix.]\nThe Chairman. I am now going to introduce our witnesses. I\nwill introduce all four now. First, Captain Michael Schmoyer,\nAssistant Deputy Secretary for National Security at HHS.\nCaptain Schmoyer serves as the Secretary's Senior Intelligence\nOfficial and Federal Senior Intelligence Coordinator for HHS.\nThe Office of National Security functions as a Federal\nIntelligence Coordinating Office for the Department. As the\nFICO, the Office of National Security provides departmental\noversight to areas of intelligence, counterintelligence,\npersonnel security, and the safeguarding of classified\ninformation.\nDr. Lawrence Tabak is Principal Deputy Director of the\nNational Institutes of Health. Dr. Tabak was appointed\nPrincipal Deputy Director at NIH in 2010. Previously he served\nas Acting Principal Deputy Director at NIH between 2008 and\n2009.\nMr. Les Hollie is Chief of Investigative Operations at the\nDepartment of HHS, Office of Inspector General. He is the\nsenior-level executive responsible for coordinating OIG's\nnational initiative pertaining to research integrity. Under his\nleadership, the OI has recovered more than $5 billion through\ninvestigations.\nMr. Louis Rodi is Deputy Assistant Director of Homeland\nSecurity Investigations at the Department of Homeland Security.\nIn this capacity, Mr. Rodi is responsible for strategic\nplanning, national policy implementation, and the development\nand execution of operational initiatives. He oversees the\nDepartment's national security programs, including the national\nsecurity unit that partners with FBI's Joint Terrorism Task\nForce, the Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Unit, and the\nCounter Terrorism and Criminal Exploitation Unit. He also\noversees the student and exchange visitors program.\nSo we are going to start with Captain Schmoyer.\nSTATEMENT OF CAPTAIN MICHAEL SCHMOYER, Ph.D., ASSISTANT DEPUTY\nSECRETARY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY; AND DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF\nNATIONAL SECURITY, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES,\nWASHINGTON, DC\nDr. Schmoyer. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member\nWyden, and distinguished members of the committee.\nIt is an honor to appear before you today to discuss the\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Service's efforts to\naddress foreign threats. My testimony today will focus on the\nthreats foreign governments and foreign agents present to U.S.\nGovernment-funded medical research; the efforts undertaken by\nHHS to detect the threats and protect the integrity of medical\nresearch--an area that is critical for our Nation's ability to\nprovide health care and for bio-defense; and the role of HHS's\nOffice of National Security, or ONS, and its capabilities.\nMy name is Captain Michael Schmoyer, and I am the Assistant\nDeputy Secretary for National Security, and the Director of\nHHS's ONS. I report directly to the HHS Deputy Secretary and\nalso serve as the Secretary's Senior Intelligence Official on\nintelligence and counterintelligence issues.\nONS's responsibilities include integrating intelligence and\nsecurity information into HHS policy and operational decisions;\nassessing, anticipating, and warning of potential security\nthreats to HHS, and national security in general; and providing\npolicy guidance on and managing the implementation of the\nDepartment's national security intelligence and\ncounterintelligence programs.\nIn coordination with the Director of National Intelligence,\nONS is the Department's Federal intelligence coordination\noffice, and I serve as the Department's Federal Senior\nIntelligence Coordinator.\nI am also the designated senior official within the\nDepartment who is responsible for countering threats from\nforeign intelligence agencies. ONS has a critical mission that\nfocuses on protecting HHS's ability to conduct research that\nwill lead to the development of treatments, diagnostics, and\nvaccines to address public health needs, including the ever-\nevolving threat of newly emerging and re-emerging infectious\ndisease caused by pathogens that could be biological threats to\nthe homeland.\nWhile appreciating the value of scientific advancement, HHS\nhas an equal interest in maintaining the integrity of the\nDepartment's scientific enterprise. Similarly, HHS embraces the\ncontributions that foreign partnerships have made to expanding\nscientific knowledge that protects, promotes, and advances\npublic health and medical research pursuits worldwide.\nThrough work with our national security partners over the\npast 2 years, ONS became aware of threats to the grants process\nand intellectual property that is a cornerstone of the\nDepartment's core values and biomedical research integrity. ONS\nquickly worked with NIH, the OIG, the FBI, and the National\nCounterintelligence and Security Center to identify steps to\nmitigate these threats to U.S. biomedical research. We mitigate\nthreats in three fundamental ways.\nFirst, identifying foreign intelligence threats and sharing\nof threat information with our agencies, including NIH, the\nFBI, and the broader intelligence community. Second,\nsafeguarding HHS's sensitive information, relationships,\nproperty, and activities. And third, preventing and detecting\ninsider threats.\nONS takes full advantage of the resources and authorities\nthat we currently have to build interdisciplinary partnerships,\nboth internally and externally, to conduct assessments of HHS's\nsensitive information, property, and activities. We have found\nthese assessments are the cornerstone for all of our\ncorresponding security and counter-threat activities.\nONS also works closely with the Department of Justice and\nthe broader intelligence community to identify researchers who\nmay have engaged in problematic practices with foreign entities\nthat may have unduly influenced and capitalized on U.S.-\nconducted research. ONS has access to a variety of databases\nthat enable us to vet employees, as well as visitors to HHS\nfacilities, including NIH. These database results are linked to\nour national security partners to ensure the results we have\nare both reliable and valid.\nAdditionally, we have recently initiated new efforts within\nONS that will be dedicated to working with universities to\nempower their programs to address threats to research\nintegrity. We have been excited to work with NIH, FBI, OIG, and\nNCSC to see this new effort grow.\nONS will continue to ensure our national security-related\nefforts support successful relationships with foreign\nscientists in all countries, supporting the research enterprise\nwhile simultaneously protecting national security equities.\nIn closing, thank you for the opportunity to review the\nnational security role and work of ONS and our efforts to\naddress foreign threats to research.\n[The prepared statement of Dr. Schmoyer appears in the\nappendix.]\nThe Chairman. Dr. Tabak?\nSTATEMENT OF LAWRENCE A. TABAK, D.D.S., Ph.D., PRINCIPAL DEPUTY\nDIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, BETHESDA, MD\nDr. Tabak. Thank you, Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member\nWyden, and committee members.\nI am honored to be here today to represent the National\nInstitutes of Health as its Principal Deputy Director. As this\nis not a committee before which we frequently appear, I think\nit would be helpful to say a bit about the work we do to\nprovide some context for the hearing.\nNIH is the world's leading public funder of the global\nbiomedical research enterprise, supporting more than 300,000\nresearchers and staff across the Nation. Groundbreaking\nresearch funded by NIH conducted at institutions in each of\nyour home States has transformed the health of America. Every\ngeneration has benefited from the scientific advances and\nincreased life expectancy that NIH helps usher in.\nTo support the very best science, NIH pioneered the gold\nstandard for peer review of research grant applications. In\nfiscal year 2018, we asked more than 26,000 peer reviewers to\nassess the scientific merit of more than 80,000 applications\nthat were being considered for funding.\nUnfortunately it has become apparent that a small\nproportion of scientists have received foreign research support\nthat they did not properly disclose on their grant\napplications, have obligations to institutions other than those\nidentified in their grant applications, and have attempted to\nsubvert the peer review process to improve their own funding\nchances.\nIn all instances, these behaviors may lead to inappropriate\nfunding decisions and ultimately the diversion of proprietary\ninformation from American institutions. As of May 2019, we have\ncontacted 61 awarding institutions about specific concerns we\nhave related to this issue, and this process is ongoing.\nPartnering with research institution leadership is a key,\nas our awards are made to institutions, not to individuals. Our\nefforts have led to specific personnel being removed from\ngrants or even being terminated from their institutions. And\nincreasingly, institutions are adopting better monitoring and\nreporting systems.\nNIH staff has been explicitly trained to identify\nsuspicious activity of peer reviewers and of key personnel\nlisted in grant applications, and to report this to NIH\nresearch integrity officers. We regularly partner with\ncolleagues at the Department of Health and Human Services and\nother Federal agencies, such as the FBI, to exchange\ninformation on emerging threats. We also engage our stakeholder\ncommunity in a variety of forums, including the Advisory\nCommittee of the NIH Director, which next week will meet to\ncontinue the public discussion about best practices to prevent\nand detect untoward foreign influences in our system.\nThat stated, we remain conscious of how these actions could\naffect the morale of honest and dedicated foreign-born\nresearchers who are hard at work assisting and often leading\nthe advancement of scientific knowledge. Since 2000, 39 percent\nof U.S. Nobel Prizes in physics, chemistry, and medicine have\nbeen awarded to foreign-born scientists. U.S. scientists\nroutinely collaborate productively with investigators in\nforeign countries. Furthermore, because disease emerges from\nmany parts of the world, we must rely on productive research\ncollaborations with foreign entities to share information on\nseasonal and pre-pandemic influenza or emergent or re-emerging\ninfectious diseases such as SARS, MERS, Zeka, and Ebola.\nThe individuals violating laws and policies represent a\nsmall proportion of scientists in and with U.S. institutions.\nWe cannot afford to reject brilliant minds working honestly and\ncollaboratively to provide hope and healing to millions around\nthe world.\nIn closing, we at NIH are devoted to ensuring that American\ntaxpayers get the full benefit of their investment in NIH: the\nvery best science conducted in the most ethical way that leads\nto improvements in health for them and their families.\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions.\n[The prepared statement of Dr. Tabak appears in the\nappendix.]\nThe Chairman. Mr. Hollie?\nSTATEMENT OF LESLIE W. HOLLIE, CHIEF OF INVESTIGATIVE\nOPERATIONS, OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH\nAND HUMAN SERVICES, WASHINGTON, DC\nMr. Hollie. Good morning, Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member\nWyden, and distinguished members of the committee. I am Les\nHollie, Chief of Investigative Operations with the Department\nof Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General.\nI appreciate the opportunity to appear before you to\ndiscuss how OIG is working in conjunction with our HHS and law\nenforcement partners to protect taxpayer-funded medical\nresearch. Today I will cover how OIG enhances the Federal\nGovernment's ability to detect, deter, and take enforcement\naction to ensure integrity of\ntaxpayer-funded medical research against foreign threats.\nThe National Institutes of Health have recently referred to\nOIG for investigation 16 allegations of noncompliance with its\nterms and conditions for receiving a medical research grant.\nThe allegations primarily deal with the failure of principal\ninvestigators to disclose foreign government affiliations.\nThese referrals are still active. To avoid compromising ongoing\ninvestigations, I cannot provide further details at this time.\nHowever, I can cover how we generally handle grant fraud\nallegations.\nAlthough the foreign threat to research is a high-profile,\ncomplex issue, the cases under our purview all involve aspects\nof grant fraud, a subject which OIG has extensive experience\ninvestigating.\nHHS is the largest grant-making organization and third\nlargest contracting agency in the Federal Government. Given\nthis nexus, OIG has made oversight and enforcement of grant and\ngrant-\nrelated program integrity a priority. We take a two-pronged\napproach to preventing and acting against grant fraud.\nFirst, OIG works collaboratively to mitigate grant fraud\nthrough efforts to minimize vulnerabilities, including audits,\nevaluations, and proactive training.\nSecond, we investigate allegations of criminal misconduct\nand make appropriate referrals for criminal, civil, and\nadministrative action. OIG receives allegations of grant fraud\nor uncovers potential grant fraud in a variety of ways,\nincluding OIG hotline complaints, referrals from HHS operating\ndivisions, law enforcement partners, whistleblower disclosures,\nand proactive data analysis.\nUpon receiving an allegation pertaining to grant fraud\ninvolving NIH or another HHS operating division, OIG evaluates\nthe allegation and determines whether we will open an\ninvestigation, refer the matter to another agency with\nappropriate authorities, or, when appropriate, refer the matter\nback to the HHS operating division involved for administrative\nreview and potential action.\nWhen OIG identifies a violation of civil or criminal law\nduring an investigation, OIG presents the facts to the\nDepartment of Justice for consideration. To protect the\nintegrity of medical research, OIG coordinates with the HHS\nOffice of National Security and works together on matters with\nthe FBI and the Department of Homeland Security when\nappropriate.\nOIG also works collaboratively with stakeholders to\nincrease their ability to prevent and detect grant fraud\nthrough proactive training. OIG increases HHS employee,\ncontractor, and grantee awareness of how to identify and report\nallegations pertaining to grant fraud, including foreign\nthreats, through training and presentations.\nFor instance, OIG has provided numerous grant fraud\ntraining sessions at the NIH regional seminars and town hall\nmeetings. To educate grant recipient organizations, OIG has\npartnered with several academic entities to address best\npractices to ensure research integrity officers and compliance\nofficers are informed on the roles, responsibilities, and\nauthorities of OIG.\nOIG also conducts oversight of NIH through audits and\nevaluations. Utilizing the $5 million in fiscal year 2019\nappropriations we received for oversight of grant programs and\noperations of NIH, we have ongoing work looking into NIH's\ncybersecurity, pre-award processes, and peer review procedures\nand controls.\nIn conclusion, OIG is committed to working collaboratively\nto address foreign threats to taxpayer-funded medical research\nthrough preventive efforts to mitigate risk and minimize\nvulnerabilities in HHS programs and conduct enforcement actions\nwhenever necessary.\nThank you for your ongoing leadership in this area and for\naffording me the opportunity to discuss this important topic\nwith you.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Hollie appears in the\nappendix.]\nThe Chairman. Thank you as well. Now, Mr. Rodi?\nSTATEMENT OF LOUIS A. RODI III, DEPUTY ASSISTANT DIRECTOR,\nNATIONAL SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION, IMMIGRATION AND\nCUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY,\nWASHINGTON, DC\nMr. Rodi. Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Wyden, and\ndistinguished members of the committee, thank you for the\nopportunity to discuss the role U.S. Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) plays in\naddressing foreign threats to taxpayer-funded research.\nThe threat posed by nation-states illegally or subversively\nseeking to exploit legitimate educational research\nopportunities in the United States is evolving. HSI is well-\npositioned to mitigate this threat through the programs I will\nhighlight today, all of which provide a multi-layered level of\nsecurity aimed at protecting the homeland from illicit\ntransnational activities of its adversaries.\nEach year, thousands of foreign nationals seek visas to\ntravel to the United States to pursue educational degrees or\nconduct research, and thousands more are already present in the\nUnited States engaged in such activity. While openness in\ninternational collaboration in academia and research is\nimportant, it can also create an environment that U.S.\nadversaries exploit as a means to gain access to sensitive\ntechnology and information.\nThe largest number of ongoing HSI Counter-Proliferation\nInvestigations, or CPI, on controlled exports, including\nintangible exports, involve China, Iran, and Russia. From these\ninvestigations, and based on trend analysis, HSI knows that\nthese countries are actively working to illicitly or\nsubversively acquire and transfer\nexport-controlled military and dual-use technology and\ncommodities.\nExploitation of academia and U.S. research institutions is\njust one of the schemes these countries are employing to obtain\naccess to sensitive research in export-controlled information\nand technology and facilitate its transfer abroad. Foreign\nnationals from China, Iran, and Russia represent a sizeable\nportion of the overall non-immigrant student population\ncurrently in the United States. As of May 2019, there are over\n350,000 F-1 Chinese students, over 11,000 F-1 Iranians, and\nover 6,100 F-1 Russians in the United States, many of whom are\nenrolled in STEM-related programs.\nHSI has established a multi-dimensional approach to combat\nthese efforts. HSI's first line of effort is preventative and\nexecuted by the HSI-led Visa Security Program, or VSP, through\nwhich HSI and interagency partners screen, vet, and investigate\npotential applicants, including those applying for student or\nexchange visitor visas, prior to admission into the United\nStates. If sufficient derogatory information is uncovered\nrelating to the intentions of these applicants, HSI, working in\nconjunction with the Department of State, can recommend\nrefusals of visas on a number of grounds, including suspected\ninvolvement in the elicit procurement of controlled technology.\nHSI also has multiple programs to identify and protect\nagainst foreign entities already present in the United States.\nThe Student Exchange Visitor Program, SEVP, fulfills a\ncompliance-centric role and is responsible for monitoring\ncertified educational institutions and the nonimmigrant\nstudents they enroll.\nSEVP also regularly conducts compliance site visits to\nschools to ensure that the programs are functioning as reported\nin SEVIS, the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System.\nHSI actively identifies and initiates enforcement action on\nnonimmigrant visa overstay violators who pose a concern for\nnational security, border security, or public safety, and works\nclosely with SEVP and CPI to mitigate risks.\nHSI's Counterterrorism and Criminal Exploitation Unit,\nCTCEU, conducts outreach as well as in-depth analysis on\npotential school fraud violations, focusing attention on a\nnumber of indicators to include schools receiving Federal\nfunding for sensitive research. HSI has also initiated the\nDomestic Mantis Program, which identifies students who have\nchanged their field of study from a nonsensitive to a sensitive\narea and evaluates those individuals against risk-based\ntargeting criteria. If students or exchange visitors appear to\nbe involved in efforts to acquire and transfer sensitive\ninformation or technology obtained during the course of their\nresearch or academic pursuits, HSI's CPI program coordinates an\ninvestigative and enforcement response to those activities.\nHSI is designated as a primary law enforcement agency for\ninvestigating violations of the U.S. export laws. Many of these\nlaws are being circumvented by state actors who are making a\nconcerted effort to take advantage of academic openness in the\nname of fundamental research to acquire U.S. technology,\nprocesses, and other intellectual property. To mitigate this\nthreat, HSI's CPI program has recently taken proactive steps to\nincrease outreach to export control officers and other\nofficials within the academic community, particularly at\nuniversities or research institutions with large foreign\nstudent populations enrolled in STEM-related programs.\nThese outreach efforts, conducted in conjunction with SEVP\nand CTCEU, are designed to raise awareness of the potential\nproliferation risks posed by students and researchers to help\ninstitutions recognize potential instances of elicit\nprocurement, intellectual property theft, or other possible\nviolations of U.S. laws, and to provide a conduit to report any\nsuspicious activities detected by universities or research\ninstitutes.\nTogether these programs form the backbone of HSI's efforts\nto identify and mitigate the threats posed by foreign entities\nseeking to exploit legitimate academic and research\nopportunities within the United States. Enhancements and\nexpansion of these programs, combined with enhanced\nadministrative and criminal enforcement authorities, will only\nimprove HSI's ability to identify and thwart the efforts of\nforeign actors who pose national security or public safety\nconcerns to the United States.\nHSI looks forward to continuing to work with the committee\nregarding its HSI programs.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Rodi appears in the\nappendix.]\nThe Chairman. Thank you all very much.\nMy first three questions are to all of you, and I hope I\ncan get a one- or two-word answer from each. So the first one\nis kind of a ``yes'' or ``no.''\nIs the foreign threat to the integrity of taxpayer-funded\nresearch real, aggressive, and ongoing? Captain?\nDr. Schmoyer. Sir, thank you for your question. HHS Office\nof National Security and the Department in general is concerned\nabout any threats, whether they are foreign or domestic. We\nspend a very large amount of our resources addressing any of\nthose threats that would be coming in. And so we work very\nclosely with our counterparts across the table, as well as the\nintelligence community. We use their guidance and their\nintelligence that they provide us, and address our efforts in\nthat particular fashion.\nThe Chairman. You cannot separate foreign, whether foreign\nis a threat? Because you mixed it up with everything else. I am\nkind of getting at an answer. I want to know what you think\nabout foreign. Is it a threat to taxpayer-funded research,\nreal, aggressive, and ongoing?\nDr. Schmoyer. We do appreciate the intelligence that we\nreceive from the intelligence community, as well as our law\nenforcement partners, which does provide us these particular\ntypes of data that allow us to tailor our efforts to those\nthreats that are focused on specific behaviors in the\nDepartment. In a more sensitive environment, sir, I am more\nthan happy to go into specifics.\nThe Chairman. Thank you. We will do that. Dr. Tabak?\nDr. Tabak. So again, sir, I would concur with my colleague\nand, in a more sensitive environment, we can go into more\ndetail.\nThe Chairman. Okay; let us go to question number two. Based\non your experience, which country is the greatest threat to the\nintegrity of taxpayer-funded research?\nDr. Schmoyer. Thank you for your question, sir. Again, in a\nmore sensitive environment--thank you, sir.\nThe Chairman. Thank you. Let us go to a whole different\nsubject, then. According to the NIH, it operates the intramural\nprogram and the extramural program for research activities.\nWithin the intramural program--this is for Dr. Tabak--NIH\nemployees, contractors, affiliates who are U.S. citizens\nundergo background investigations. Further, prior to that\nbackground check, a special agency check is conducted requiring\nfingerprints to be cross-checked with the FBI criminal\ndatabase, including the terrorist watch list.\nAccording to NIH, in the extramural program, a grantee\ninstitution such as a university is responsible for any\nvetting, not your agency.\nSo the first question to you: NIH has said U.S. citizens in\nthe intramural program are subject to background checks. Do\nforeign nationals working in the NIH intramural program undergo\nthe same screening as U.S. citizens?\nDr. Tabak. Yes, sir, they do.\nThe Chairman. Okay. Also to you, with respect to the\nextramural program, more than 8 dollars out of 10 appropriated\nto the NIH go to this program. Does NIH conduct background\nchecks, including a review for counterintelligence purposes, on\nprincipal investigators prior to awarding a grantee institution\ntaxpayer money?\nDr. Tabak. No, sir, we do not, as they are employees of\ntheir home institutions.\nThe Chairman. Okay. According to HHS OIG, NIH has recently\nreferred for investigation 16 allegations of noncompliance\nrelated to medical research. The IG stated the allegations\nprimarily deal with the failure of principal researchers to\ndisclose foreign government affiliations.\nSo again to you, how is NIH discovering these cases for\nreferral? And is NIH doing its own review? Or are the research\ninstitutions fighting potential problems for your agency?\nDr. Tabak. We flag these in various ways. Our own staff\nuses algorithms to detect potential untoward behavior. We also\nreceive referrals from our colleagues at HHS and the FBI. And\nincreasingly universities, as they become more and more aware\nof the issue, are alerting us to potential issues as well.\nThe Chairman. Then finally for you, but you will have to do\nit in writing, because I do not think you are prepared to do\nthis now. Would you provide us in writing to the committee a\nspecific breakdown of how each referral originated, whether by\nNIH or a research institution?\nDr. Tabak. We would provide that for the record, but it\nwould have to go in concert with the IG. We have already made\nthose referrals, and they are ongoing investigations.\nThe Chairman. Okay; thank you.\nSenator Wyden?\nSenator Wyden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was just looking\nat my friend, Senator Cornyn. The two of us are on the\nIntelligence Committee, and so we have watched you all try to\nrespond to Chairman Grassley's questions, his always good\nquestions.\nLet me, if I could, kind of see if--because we are not\ngoing to be able to ask some important questions in a\nclassified session in a way that the American people are going\nto actually learn something about the important questions being\nraised here. So I am going to see if I can tease out some\nanswers to these issues that also are sensitive to what Senator\nCornyn and I know are classified matters of what are called\nsources and methods.\nAt page 3 of your testimony, Dr. Tabak--and you are at NIH,\na crown jewel for health-care research--you say: ``A few\nforeign governments have initiated systematic programs to in\neffect capitalize on research and unduly influence U.S.-based\nresearchers.''\nWhat is ``a few''? Are we talking about three? Are we\ntalking about seven? How many are we talking about? That is not\nsomething that compromises sources and methods or American\nsecurity.\nDr. Tabak. Again, sir, I think that is best discussed in a\nmore sensitive environment.\nSenator Wyden. Senator Cornyn and I deal with classified\nmaterials. I mean, giving a range of the number of countries is\nnot something that would damage American security. So three?\nSeven? Five? How many?\nDr. Tabak. Sir, again I think that is just something that\nwe should discuss in a more sensitive----\nSenator Wyden. I do not share your view. Then you say that\nthese foreign governments unduly influence U.S.-based\nresearchers. How do they do that?\nDr. Tabak. So this is done in a variety of ways, sir. They\nprovide financial remuneration to individuals. In some\ninstances these individuals have signed contracts which require\nthem to spend a certain percent of their time in a foreign\ngovernment, in a foreign country. They might set up a\nlaboratory in that situation.\nIn other instances, they expect that the individual will\nshare with that government grant applications, which obviously\nis a theft of intellectual capital. And in some instances,\nbecause they are interested in recruiting additional\nindividuals to this process, they will set up cabals, if you\nwill, in peer review to have sort of a quid pro quo.\nSenator Wyden. Okay. In the area of genomic research, you\nall did not agree with the HHS Inspector General's\nrecommendations to develop a new kind of security framework. I\ngather that you felt that existing procedures are adequate to\naddress the concerns that were raised by the Inspector General.\nIs that true? Do you by and large think that existing\nprocedures are adequate to address those issues that you just\ndescribed to me are problems?\nDr. Tabak. Sir, it is important to note that the OIG report\nwas on genomic data sharing specifically.\nSenator Wyden. Let's talk about that. Do you think the\nexisting procedures are adequate there?\nDr. Tabak. We continue to work on these to enhance them.\nThe main reason for our nonconcurrence on that report, sir, was\nthe specific indication that by sharing genomic data, human\ngenomic data, we were putting the Nation at risk. And frankly,\nsir, that was based on speculation that was unsubstantiated.\nAnd I will quote from the report directly, sir, on page 3 of\nthat report, and I quote: ``We have not performed audit work to\nverify the FBI's conclusions.''\nSenator Wyden. Okay. Let me ask you one other question, if\nI might, because again--and I do not want to be deliberately\nobstreperous, but the American people want answers in open\nsession to these kinds of issues in a way that does not\ncompromise, as Senator Cornyn and I know, sources and methods\nand classified information.\nTell us, if you would, how prevalent a problem you think\nthis is. In other words, you made that statement at page 3, a\nfew foreign governments have these systematic programs. You\noutlined some things which certainly strike me as wrong.\nBut I think, before I wrap up my first round--how serious a\nproblem is this? Tell us that in English so people have a sense\nof what we are dealing with here.\nDr. Tabak. So the numbers are relatively small, but the\nproblem is important. Thus far, as I indicated in my testimony,\nwe have been working with 61 institutions, and that number\nchanges. That number will undoubtedly increase as we learn\nmore.\nSenator Wyden. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nThe Chairman. Now, Senator Cornyn?\nSenator Cornyn. Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this\nhearing today. Among all the issues that we deal with here in\nWashington, DC, and particularly in Congress, this ranks right\nup there as one of the most urgent and important issues to our\neconomy and our national security. China's aggressive plan to\ndominate the United States economically, militarily, and\ntechnologically includes the willingness to use whatever means\nare necessary, legal or not, overt or covert, to achieve its\ngoals.\nAs the FBI has previously told us--and I agree with you,\nMr. Chairman, it is a shame that they are not here today, the\nFBI, because of course they are the primary counterintelligence\ninvestigation arm of the Federal Government. No longer are\nchallenges so much as they were in the cold war, spy versus\nspy. Now we have spy versus nontraditional collectors. And this\nis what Director Wray of the FBI said in February. He said the\nuse of nontraditional collectors, especially in the academic\nsetting, whether it is professors, scientists, students--we see\nit in almost every field office that the FBI has around the\ncountry. It is not just in major cities. It is in small ones as\nwell, and it is across basically every discipline. And I think\nthe level of naivete on the part of the academic sector about\nthis creates its own issues.\nAs a leader of a major research institution in my State\ntold me recently, he said, ``We are under attack.'' And I think\nafter today those of us in attendance will come to concur with\nthat statement.\nOur universities and other research institutions are under\nthreat by both human actors and by the cyber-threat. American\ninstitutes of higher education and the agencies that provide\nbillions of dollars in taxpayer dollars to conduct research\nevery year must work together to confront this very real\ndanger.\nAccording to my statistics here, the U.S. Government alone\nspends about $120 billion in research and development grants,\nthe private sector, another $500 billion. And if China or any\nadversary can simply steal it, obviously that is a huge threat\nnot only to us from a security standpoint but from an economic\nstandpoint. Because China is not--they are not unclear about\nwhat their goals are. Their goals are to dominate the United\nStates militarily and economically.\nWell, next week I am going to introduce a piece of\nlegislation that I would hope my colleagues would join me in\nworking on called the ``Secure Our Research Act.'' This will\nestablish an interagency working group to develop an agency-\nwide compliance framework to enhance cybersecurity protocols\nand protect federally funded research from foreign\ninterference, espionage, and exfiltration.\nI simply will not be able to vote in good conscience for\nany taxpayer dollars to be used for research at public\ninstitutions unless these institutions up their game\nsignificantly and can give us some confidence that those\ntaxpayer dollars are not only being well spent in research and\ndevelopment, but that that research information is not being\nstolen right under our nose.\nIt is high time we address this threat and find solutions\nto fix the vulnerabilities that exist today. U.S. colleges and\nuniversities, I agree with the ranking member, have long been a\nMecca for foreign nationals because of the high quality of the\neducation we provide, and the academic and cultural freedoms\nthat exist in our country.\nBut that same sort of open society and these institutions\nrepresent a vulnerability that we can protect against. I think\nwe can continue to be that Mecca for foreign students to study\nat our colleges and universities and, at the same time, protect\nthe taxpayer and the important scientific research that is\ngenerated from these institutions. Because we are in a global\ncompetition, whether we like it or not, and it is, to use the\nwords of the FBI Director, naive of any of us to think that it\ndoes not exist and that it is not an urgent matter that\ndeserves our attention.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nThe Chairman. Senator Cassidy?\nSenator Cassidy. Mr. Rodi, long before I was in politics, I\nremember reading about Russian, Soviet scientists coming here,\ngoing to our different resources, and they had been trained to\nmemorize, to notice detail. So industrial espionage is not new.\nI have read about French sitting behind our scientists on\nairplanes and looking over their shoulder to see the notes that\nthey are reading. So whether that is true or not, it makes a\ngreat story, doesn't it?\nSo this is not new. I am assuming that we have established\nprotocols: these folks are at high risk; these are not. The\ngrad student who is doing finance presumably has less access to\npatentable research than the one who is doing advanced carbon\ntechnology for weaponry sort of thing. Is that a fair\nstatement?\nMr. Rodi. Yes, sir.\nSenator Cassidy. So, as Senator Cornyn expresses his\nconcerns, I can imagine the university administrators being a\nlittle nervous. How do we isolate the subset of folks we need\nto be aware of, if we have this many hardworking, very\ntalented, bright students, but most of them in fields where\nreally you could steal it, but who cares, as opposed to the few\nwho are a concern? Do we have a mechanism that allows that\nuniversity administrator to begin to make a judgment as to whom\nthey should have under closer watch, and those whom you can\nkind of not spend your scarce resources on?\nMr. Rodi. Yes, sir. That is the whole purpose of our\noutreach program. Our Project Shield America, it is our\nCounter-Proliferation Investigation's outreach program. We have\na certain subset Project Shield America for Academia to meet\nwith academia and address these issues, to inform them of some\nof the threats and the concerns that are out there, what to\nlook for. What are the proliferation concerns of the United\nStates? What should they be looking for? What should they not\nbe sharing with foreign students, and the like? So, yes, we\nhave a very robust outreach program to address these issues.\nSenator Cassidy. Dr. Tabak, I am a physician. I am a liver\ndoctor, and I remember there was a pathologist I worked with, a\nvery talented young man, and this was years ago, 30 years ago,\nand he just took a job back in Hong Kong, or Taiwan, or maybe\nthe mainland, probably Hong Kong or Taiwan at the time, and he\nwas just a talented doc. He had done research, all clinically\noriented, and he just got a great job offer.\nNow in one sense I can see that could be seen as a threat,\nbecause he was very involved in research, but in reality it was\njust a great job offer. How do we differentiate that from\nsystematic espionage?\nDr. Tabak. Senator, that is a success story. Unless the\nindividual is not playing by the rules and tries to divert work\nthat was supported by the U.S. Government to a foreign----\nSenator Cassidy. Now let me ask, because some of that work\nis now in his neurons. And so wherever he goes, he is\ninfluenced by the fact that he has learned--at the time, PCR\nwas cutting-edge technology. So he is familiar with the\nimplications of PCR. We cannot erase his neurons. So again, how\ndo we differentiate that which is just organic and that which\nis espionage?\nDr. Tabak. So again, what you described in the former case\nis how science advances, building upon building. In the latter\ncase, people diverting things inappropriately for untoward\npurposes, that can be espionage.\nSenator Cassidy. Now, I accept that. So is the bright line\nhere, okay, I am going to put in a thumb drive and download a\nlot of material and try to sneak it across, or send it over on\nmy gmail account as opposed to my official account, is that the\nbright line versus, I just know this because I have been\nworking very hard in the lab in 18-hour days and now, wherever\nI go, I am going to bring that body of knowledge?\nDr. Tabak. How that knowledge is transferred can make a\ndifference, sir, yes.\nSenator Cassidy. So it can make a difference--no offense,\nbut a little bit of a wiggle word. I am actually looking for\nsome guidance for those university administrators.\nSo I learned it. It is in my brain. It may be in my notes,\nbecause I kept notes as I did experiments. That is okay.\nDownloading on my thumb drive and/or otherwise trying to\nelectronically communicate or bring huge stacks is not okay.\nDr. Tabak. As you know, sir, that information that is\ngathered while you are employed by the university supported by\nU.S. Government grants is the property of the university, not\nthe individual. So they would have to have that conversation as\nto what is being taken and not taken.\nSenator Cassidy. I get that. I can still imagine the--I\nmean, because classically the post-doc who is so bright might\nbe a Chinese national, but he might be employing Chinese\nnationals because you have a lot of bright kids over here who\nwork so hard. So I am trying to give some guidance to our\ninstitutions as to when they should say, ``Okay, we need to\nvigilant.'' Captain, did you have something to say to that? May\nI go over a little bit, Mr. Chairman? I am over my time. Can I\nhave a minute more?\nThe Chairman. Yes.\nSenator Cassidy. Okay, Captain.\nDr. Schmoyer. Yes, sir. I had mentioned in my remarks that\nwe are excited to be working with the National Institutes of\nHealth and a variety of our law enforcement partners on some\nefforts to address the work that we are doing with institutes\nof higher education.\nA specific element of that work, sir, is looking at these\nparticular factors that are out there, being able to look at\nwhat type of methodology that individuals are using, looking at\nlessons learned that we use with NIH as well as the other parts\nof our department to determine, when you are addressing these\ntypes of issues, these are the things to look for. Being able\nto train those institutes to be able to look at those\nparticular factors is critical for their success in being able\nto prevent them.\nSenator Cassidy. So we have guidelines that we can give the\nuniversity that they follow--or at least they are doing due\ndiligence?\nDr. Schmoyer. Yes, sir. We have these guidelines that we\nuse within the Department. We have these guidelines that we\nhave done in conjunction with the NCSC as well as FBI. Our goal\nover the next couple of months is to be able to continue those\nactivities to expand that educational process to our funded\npartners.\nSenator Cassidy. Thank you all.\nThe Chairman. Let's see. Senator Whitehouse, if you are\nready. You are not ready. [Laughter.]\nI have one question of Mr. Rodi. The focus of our hearing\ntoday is on the theft of our research and intellectual property\nby China and others. What other countries or governments are\nyou concerned about that are exploiting loopholes in our\nimmigration system to further that theft? And could you give\nsome specific examples of the exploitation?\nMr. Rodi. Yes, sir. Well the top three, as I have stated,\nare China, Iran, and Russia, but there are other countries of\nconcern as well. We look at the empirical data of the\ninvestigations that are being conducted by our counter-\nproliferation investigations unit. Other countries of concern\ninclude India and Pakistan. There are other countries as well.\nAnd I have some specific examples that I will give later\ntoday in the classified setting, but just off the top of my\nhead, a really good example that I like to highlight is someone\nwho is coming here from Iran to study civil engineering. And as\nwe delve deeper into what the person is here actually studying,\nwe learn that they are here to study about concrete, and the\neffects of concrete, and the uses of concrete. Well, we all\nknow that Iran is building tunnels to hide their nuclear\nprogram, their nuclear missile launching pads, their entire\nnuclear program. So when we are looking into an Iranian student\nwho is here to learn applied techniques of concrete, that is of\nconcern to me and to my agency, the fact that they are using\nthat technology to build these bunkers. And there are other\nexamples as well.\nThe Iranian students who come here to study welding. And\nthen as we dig deeper into their theses and their\ndissertations, what type of welding are they actually looking\nat? And you look at, well, they are looking at learning how to\nweld titanium, titanium for air frames. Well, we gave the\nIranians their air force back in the 1970s, and those planes\nare falling apart now because they cannot get spare parts. But\nthey are coming here to learn how to fix those planes by\nlearning welding techniques to salvage the planes that they do\nhave.\nThe Chairman. Senator Whitehouse?\nSenator Whitehouse. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\nProbably this is a question more for Homeland Security, but\nI will take an answer from anyone, and that is: have you seen\nany efforts to try to obscure the true identity of a foreign\ncountry or interest in this effort to expropriate American\nscientific research or talent to a foreign country, along the\nlines of shell corporations, or any devices for masking real\nidentities? Or is it just, students come here, study things, go\nhome?\nMr. Rodi. I do not have any specific examples to address\nthat specific question. We are focused mainly on students, what\nthey are here to study, and what we can do to address that\nthreat.\nSenator Whitehouse. So it is basically, students come here,\nstudy, go home? That is the plot that you are looking for?\nMr. Rodi. Yes, sir.\nSenator Whitehouse. Okay. If anybody else has anything to\nadd, you are welcome to. If not, I would just like to make it a\nquestion for the record, if you could check with your staffs\nand see if, in your experience in dealing with this concern,\nwhether or not you have seen any efforts to try to mask or\nconceal identities in any way, or whether it really is just as\nsimple as student comes, student studies, student goes home.\nOkay?\nThank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nThe Chairman. Okay. Thank you. Senator Carper?\nSenator Carper. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Welcome one and all.\nAs you know, there is a lot going on on Capitol Hill today. We\nare glad you could visit with us and spend at least a short\ntime with us.\nEarly in my life I was a naval flight officer, 5 years\nactive duty, three tours in the Vietnam War, and top secret\nclearances, and I understand the need to protect that which is\nsensitive. And it sounds like we have been asking some\nquestions and you are unable to discuss the answers to some of\nthose questions in a setting like this. We understand that. I\nunderstand we may have the opportunity to meet some of you in a\nclassified setting in the SCIF later today, and hopefully we\ncan more fully question you on some of these issues.\nIn the meantime, I want to steer away from things we should\nnot be talking about in an open setting and see what we can\ntalk about in this open setting that would be informative to\nour committee and informative to the people we represent across\nthis Nation.\nI will start with Mr. Hollie. Hi, Mr. Hollie. Where are you\nfrom?\nMr. Hollie. Originally from Texas.\nSenator Carper. Okay. I used to be stationed at Corpus\nChristi Naval Air Station. It is nice to see you.\nMr. Hollie, you note in the cases that your office has\nlooked into, they all involve grant fraud. And I just want to\nknow, are there certain things that you would recommend that\nthe NIH and other grant-making agencies look for to spot\ninstances where a foreign actor might be trying to take\nadvantage of a Federal research grant program? And are there\nbest practices in grant management that you would direct\nagencies to turn to to get some assistance and guidance? A two-\npart question, please.\nMr. Hollie. Thank you for your question, sir.\nSenator Carper. You are welcome. Mr. Chairman, do you know\nwhat I love? I love hearings where all the witnesses say\n``thank you for your question.'' [Laughter.]\nAnd do you know what I say when they say that? ``You're\nwelcome.''\nMr. Hollie. Speaking not on topic today, but with regards\nto grant fraud as a general topic, we see the foreign influence\nas a subset of our general grant fraud portfolio, those best\npractices. And we are currently engaged with NIH and have been\nover a number of years, as I expressed in oral testimony. With\nregards to when we can speak about closed case investigations\ncoming back to the operating divisions and speaking on the\nvulnerabilities that were discussed, or examined, or observed\nin the investigation process, we think that is a very important\nprocess of closing the loop and educating not only the awarding\nagency but the sub-grantees as well, about things that we have\nseen in an investigation after it has been concluded that we\ncould speak on. The educational process, having a proactive\ntraining program in place when we are conducting outreach at\nthe various seminars around the country for not only NIH but\nother operating divisions within the HHS portfolio, is very,\nvery important.\nAnother area is being there actually to have the grantees\nand the grant management officials ask, ``What can we do best?\nWhat are we doing, or what should we be doing?'' I think it is\nvery important to be accessible to those individuals, and that\nhas been something that has been very robust within the IG\ncommunity, because, in law enforcement generally speaking, not\nonly within HHS and OIG as law enforcement arms, there is a\nlevel of anxiety with regards to individuals reaching out to\nlaw enforcement and speaking openly and freely. And we believe\nin the principles of, you know--we do think of those areas, and\nreducing those anxieties, so those engagements give us the\nopportunity to be accessible.\nWe have one-on-one sessions with individuals----\nSenator Carper. I am going to ask you to hold it right\nthere. That is good. That is great. Let me just ask the others.\nI am not going to ask you to say ``yes'' or ``no,'' but do any\nof you agree with anything that he has just said? Raise your\nhand if you do.\n[Hands are raised.]\nSenator Carper. All right, let the record show that\neverybody except Mr. Rodie agreed. Is there anybody who agrees\nwith everything that he has just said? Raise your hand.\n[Hand raised.]\nSenator Carper. Let the record show that one witness has\nraised two hands. [Laughter.]\nOkay, fair enough. Here is my second question. My second\nquestion is for the retired Navy Captain, Dr. Tabak, and Mr.\nHollie.\nWhat role does poor information security and failure to\nprotect sensitive information produced through Federal research\nplay here? Is there more that NIH and grant recipients need to\ndo to protect their work? Is there more that the Congress can\ndo to empower you to protect the work that is being done? So,\nCaptain?\nDr. Schmoyer. Thank you, sir. A couple of things. Number\none, we are very grateful for the resources that we have for\nour small office to be able to address a very large need within\nthe Department, as well as the overall Federal Government.\nWhen we look at this particular challenge, we are making\nfantastic strides as far as being able to balance both security\nas well as science. And the work that we have been doing in\nconjunction with NIH as well as the other elements of the\nDepartment could not be done unless that balance was there.\nI think as we continue to go forward, we would continue to\nalso be interested to speak with you, as well as your staff, to\nbe able to provide technical assistance as you are looking at\npotential legislation or other areas and how they might affect\nany organization like the Department of Health and Human\nServices and our mission to be able to preserve national\nsecurity efforts.\nSenator Carper. I know, Mr. Chairman, I am over time. Can\nwe ask these other two witnesses to just briefly respond to my\nquestion, please?\nThe Chairman. Yes.\nSenator Carper. Thanks. All right, Dr. Tabak, same\nquestion.\nDr. Tabak. So we work very closely with our colleagues at\nHHS. The oversight that Mr. Hollie spoke to makes us better,\npoints out things that we can enhance and improve.\nIn turn, we reach out to our grantee organizations to make\nsure that what they are doing at the local level is as robust\nas possible. So it is a partnership, sir.\nSenator Carper. Good. Thank you. Very briefly, Mr. Hollie,\nsame question, please.\nMr. Hollie. Yes, sir. We are currently engaged in work in\nAudit and Evaluation Division to look at internal controls at\nthe NIH. I would like to get back with the committee when that\nwork is mature and completed to speak on it with a level of\nspecificity.\nSenator Carper. Good. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator\nPortman, who is not able to be here with us today, he and I are\nthe senior Republican and senior Democrat on the Senate\nPermanent Committee on Investigations, and he and I both sent a\nletter to Secretary Azar on May 17th for information on foreign\nefforts to exploit NIH-funded research. We have asked to have a\nresponse by, I think July 7th. It looks like it is going to be\ndelayed. When we get to July 7th, what I want to ask is--this\nis for the DHS people, Health and Human Services people--I am\ngoing to ask, if we do not have an answer to the letter by July\n7th, I want, for him and for me, I want you to give us a date\nby which we will have a response to our question. Thank you,\nMr. Chairman, for your generosity.\nThe Chairman. I was told Senator Daines is coming, and if\nhe comes in, we will go to him. In the meantime, Mr. Hollie,\nwhere do the 16 referrals from NIH currently stand? Were any\ninvestigations opened or matters referred to other agencies\nsuch as the FBI? And you should be able to answer to at least\nwhat agencies they were referred to.\nMr. Hollie. Mr. Chairman, I refer you back to my oral\ntestimony. We have the 16 referrals. They are currently in our\nportfolio. I cannot make any comments beyond that.\nThe Chairman. Okay.\nSenator Wyden. Mr. Chairman, before we go to Senator\nDaines, could I just ask unanimous consent to put a statement\nfrom the Association of American Universities into the record?\nThe Chairman. Yes, without objection.\n[The statement appears in the appendix on page 74.]\nThe Chairman. Okay. Senator Daines?\nSenator Daines. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member\nWyden. Chairman Grassley, I want to thank you for holding this\nhearing. I want to thank the witnesses for coming before this\ncommittee to help us address threats to taxpayer-funded\nresearch.\nAs someone who personally spent over 5 years living and\nworking in China--we were expats in Guangzhou; I was working\nfor Proctor & Gamble. In fact, I had two children born in Hong\nKong during that time. I have led multiple codels to visit\nChina and its neighbors over the past 4 years. I have seen the\nrapid rise of the Chinese economy and seen the progress they\nhave made.\nWhen I first went to China in 1991, it was a $500-billion\neconomy. Today, depending on whose numbers you believe, it is\nsomewhere probably north of $13 trillion in GDP. Unfortunately,\na lot of the progress that has been made has been made through\nillegal acquisition of intellectual property from United States\ncompanies. We need to ensure this valuable information is not\njust protected for DoD, but for other critical areas including\nbiotech and health services.\nOver the past 5 years, the State of Montana has received\nnearly $300 million worth of grants from the Department of\nHealth and Human Services. It is critical that we ensure that\nthe valuable work being performed by Montanans is directly\nbenefiting the United States and not China.\nDr. Tabak, as the title of this hearing suggests, there are\nreal concerns that China is seeking to steal research funded by\nAmerican taxpayers. And with the improvement that China has\nproposed to its intellectual property system for new medicines,\na part of ``Made in China 2025,'' the country could be in a\nstrong position to commercialize that research.\nWhat do we need to do to ensure that American researchers,\nAmerican inventors, remain competitive and that intellectual\nproperty is protected?\nDr. Tabak. It starts with making people aware of the\nproblem. Our grantee institutions are increasingly partnering\nwith us to ensure that their faculty, the researchers that\nreceive our grants, are appropriately indicating all levels of\nsupport, regardless of where it is from--all commitments to\ninstitutions if they are outside of the one that they work at--\nand are serious about maintaining the integrity of the peer\nreview process.\nAnd if institutions ensure those three things, that will go\na long way in protecting the NIH equities that you are speaking\nto.\nSenator Daines. So, Dr. Tabak, a follow-up question. China\nappears to have taken some important steps to open up its\npharmaceutical markets by reforming its industry to better\nalign with international drug standards and reducing some\ntariffs on imported drugs. However, when you look at the ``Made\nin China 2025,'' it is pretty clear that China's goal is not to\nbuild an open market, but to build its own domestic industry.\nWhat actions are being taken to ensure that China is not\nreverse-engineering these technologies and, frankly, stealing\nintellectual property?\nDr. Tabak. Well again, sir, it is the diligence that we all\nhave to have to ensure that that which is supported by U.S.\ntaxpayer money not be bled off into foreign countries. That\nwhich is in the open market, obviously, can be reverse-\nengineered. You are quite right. But the nefarious,\ninappropriate behavior, those are things that we have to detect\nand stop at the earliest possible intervention.\nSenator Daines. Yes. I have a question for you, Captain,\nhere next, but I am a chemical engineer myself. I may be the\nonly one in Congress, actually. Most are smarter than to run\nfor Congress than anyone here. China is graduating eight times\nmore STEM grads right now than we are here in the United\nStates. They are building an innovation ecosystem that is very,\nvery powerful. And I think the rate of the acceleration in\ntheir innovation ecosystem is something that we are\nunderestimating, in my opinion, here in the United States. I\nthink of it as a competitive threat short-term and long-term\nhere in the U.S.\nI want to shift to Captain Schmoyer. The Chinese Government\nis active in gaining access to health-care and genomic data on\nU.S. persons, which not only allows them to drive new\ndiscoveries by analyzing large data sets but also creates risk\nof blackmail and potential exploitation.\nWhat steps is your department taking to ensure the\nprotection of Americans' health records from the Chinese\nGovernment?\nDr. Schmoyer. Sir, we looked at that mission in a couple of\ndifferent ways. Number one, we are a very active partner in the\nCFIUS process. And so HHS over the last year has had several\ndozen CFIUS cases that we have been involved in that have been\nlooking at foreign acquisitions in general to be able to\ndetermine whether or not there is a potential risk to national\nsecurity. It is a huge area of involvement that our office has\nin our portfolio.\nSecondly, looking at the overall importance, as I think the\npanel had mentioned earlier on, of education. Being able to let\npeople know that there needs to be that balance again between\nscience, research and development, and security. Being able to\nwork with the NIH faculty members, as well as the rest of the\nparts of the Department, to be able to educate their subject\nmatter experts on the need to be aware of how those challenges\ncreated by the work they may be doing, while it seems\ninnocuous, maybe very benign, can actually potentially threaten\nnational security.\nSo that education is really the second part.\nAnd then the third part, sir, is our interagency\ncollaboration with the intelligence community, as well as\nFederal law enforcement, to be able to determine whether or not\nthere are potential risks in those areas to our department and\nthe overall biomedical research field.\nSenator Wyden. Senator Daines, I feel badly. We are just in\nthe middle of a vote, and I want to get Senator Cantwell in----\nSenator Daines. Yes, thank you.\nSenator Wyden. Senator Cantwell?\nSenator Cantwell. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for\nthis important hearing. What I would like to focus on--\nobviously we have a lot of research institutions in the State\nof Washington--is how the Federal agencies are working with\nthose local counterparts on threat assessment. I am not sure\nthat we are painting a broad enough picture if we are not\nsharing actual threat assessment information with them.\nSo is the White House Office of Science and Technology, or\nsome other body, coordinating this policy area? And what can we\ndo to make sure there is a comprehensive approach to that,\nparticularly when it is Federal research and development? So,\nanybody on the panel. Yes, go ahead.\nDr. Schmoyer. Ma'am, we do work very closely with the\nNational Security Council on those particular matters, looking\nat the overall impact as far as the broader Nation. In\naddition, we work very closely with our Federal law enforcement\npartners. Their regional offices are engaging, for example,\nwith institutes of higher education and corporate partners that\nare in those areas.\nA third important partner for us is the work that we do\nwith Homeland Security. And so we are very delighted that we\nactually have a liaison that sits over in Mr. Rodi's area, so\nwe can make sure that the information that they are getting is\ngetting sent to the Department as well.\nSenator Cantwell. Yes?\nDr. Tabak. If I may add, the NIH Director in August 2018\nsent out a ``Dear Colleague'' letter to every one of our\ngrantee institutions to alert them to this issue. And we have\nbeen working very closely with the professional organizations,\nAPLU and AAMC and so forth, to ensure that their membership is\nincreasingly aware. And again, in partnership with my\ncolleagues here, we are doing more and more outreach to\nuniversity communities to make sure that they understand these\nissues.\nSenator Cantwell. Since we are involved in this on a broad\nscale with cybersecurity issues, one of the things that we\nconstantly face is ever-changing landscape and tactics that\npeople are using. So I am more interested in what is the--\ninstead of the ``Dear Colleague'' letter, what is the ongoing\ninfrastructure for threat assessment? That is what I would like\nto know. And if we have one, that is good to know. If we do not\nhave one, what can we do to create one?\nDr. Schmoyer. Ma'am, a couple of quick things. Number one\nwould be mentioning--I had earlier--the developing program in\nconjunction with NIH as well as our OIG partners, looking at\nworking with institutes of higher education, especially those\nthat are specifically funded by NIH, is a huge part of that.\nSecondly, in the afternoon briefing I will be able to\nprovide you specific details on what we are doing and how we\nare doing it.\nSenator Cantwell. Okay; so you are the ongoing coordinating\nentity?\nDr. Schmoyer. So we work with a variety of different\npartners. The primary one at the larger level is the National\nSecurity Council. At other levels, the National\nCounterintelligence and Security Center in conjunction with the\nFBI is a coordinating part. And then when it comes to NIH-\nfunded partners, we are the coordinating element in that body.\nSenator Cantwell. So, Senator Wyden and our colleagues\nhere, for the utility sector there are organizations that play\nthis role in coordinating with everybody, so I would hope that\nwe would figure out some formal way to make sure that these\ninstitutions are working on this collaboratively with us. But I\nthink we have to give them some ongoing information. In the\nutility sector, NERC plays that role. And so they continue to\nmonitor and feed that information. Because a lot of our\nutilities are hacked on a daily basis by state actors. So we\njust have to up our game here, and so I appreciate working with\nall of you on how we do that to communicate to the local\nentities about what is happening.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nSenator Wyden. Thank you, Senator Cantwell and colleagues.\nI very much share Senator Cantwell's view. I am kind of calling\nsome audibles here because we have some votes.\nSenator Cornyn is going to ask some things briefly, and\nthen I am going to see if I can start the next process with the\nchairman coming back. Senator Cornyn?\nSenator Cornyn. Dr. Tabak, is there a gold standard by\nwhich an institution, a research institution, can be certified\nby either a professional association or by the Federal\nGovernment to have met certain minimum standards to protect the\nintegrity of their data and their research?\nDr. Tabak. Part of the terms and conditions for all of our\nawards--there are standards that every institution needs to\nmeet and attest to. And if they fail to meet those standards,\nthen they are put under a more careful watch.\nSenator Cornyn. Because it strikes me that once the cat is\nout of the bag, it is pretty hard to get it back in. I am\nfamiliar with--and this is my last point. The Defense Security\nService issues recognitions--for example they had a ceremony\nfor Texas A&M that got a Defense Security Service Award for\nExcellence in Counterintelligence, which is the highest honor\ngiven by the DoD to defense contractors who demonstrate\nextraordinary results in enhancing national security.\nWhat I am looking for is, is there some standard Congress\ncould set or we could recognize so everybody would know sort of\nhow they need to up their game in order to keep this\ninformation safe? That is my last question.\nDr. Schmoyer. Yes, we would work with you on that, sir.\nSenator Cornyn. That is a great answer.\nSenator Wyden. Senator Cornyn quits while he is ahead.\nWhat we are going to do now is, we will excuse all of you\ngentlemen. Thank you, and I believe we are going to see you a\nbit later. So we will excuse you at this time.\nI would like to have Dr. Joe W. Gray come forward. He is an\nOregonian. We are delighted to have him from the Oregon Health\nSciences Center. And I want to just describe what will happen\nnow. There are only a couple of minutes left in the vote.\nDr. Gray is a distinguished professor and chair of the\nDepartment of Biomedical Engineering, director of the Center\nfor Spatial Systems Biomedicine, associate director for\nbiophysical oncology at the Knight Cancer Institute at OHSU,\nand he is also a principal investigator on some important\nprojects at the NCI Center for Cancer Systems Biology. He works\nat the NIH Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular\nSignature Center, the NCI Human Tumor Atlas Network Research\nCenter, and is co-director of the Serial Measurement of\nMolecular and Architectural Responses to Therapy.\nThat is a mouthful, but in plain English, Dr. Gray is a\nvery distinguished scientist, and he is from my home State. We\nare delighted to have him.\nI am going to be juggling not just the vote, but also I\nhave a meeting coming up. Chairman Grassley will be coming\nback. And I would just like for the record, Dr. Gray--apropos\nof what we talked about--I am going to give you some questions\nin writing. I hope you will also talk with Chairman Grassley\nabout the points behind these questions, because I think you\nmade an important case with respect to the essential value of\nforeign researchers to the enterprises you are involved with.\nI think you have made a critical point with respect to the\nrole of foreign researchers in developing U.S. patents and\nintellectual property, and have also had important comments\nabout the very damaging consequences of the Trump NIH budget\ncuts.\nSo I am going to ask you to respond to those questions in\nwriting for all issues that you and I have talked about. I hope\nyou will discuss them with the chairman when he comes back, and\nwe will make your remarks part of the record in their entirety.\nI am going to run and vote, and Chairman Grassley will be\ncoming right back after the vote. So, thank you for your\npatience. I am sorry that it is bedlam, even by traditional\nSenate bedlam standards, and we will stand in a brief break at\nthis time until the chairman comes back. We will have those\nquestions for the record, and I hope you will highlight those\nimportant points with the chairman as well. We will be taking a\nquick break. The chairman will be back in just a couple of\nminutes.\n[The questions appear in the appendix.]\nThe Chairman. Before you give your testimony, I want to\napologize. For people like you who travel as far as you did to\ndo this, and then to get in an environment where we have four\nvotes, and I am probably going to be the only one to hear you\nand the only one to ask questions, it is very rude of us. But I\ndo not know what we can do about it, because we do not run the\nSenate floor, we just run this committee.\nYou have been introduced by Senator Wyden, so would you\nproceed with your testimony, please, and then I will have some\nquestions. And I imagine I am the only one who is going to ask\nyou any questions, but you may get questions in writing from\nsome of us.\nSTATEMENT OF JOE W. GRAY, Ph.D., GORDON MOORE CHAIR OF\nBIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING; AND ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR FOR BIOPHYSICAL\nONCOLOGY, KNIGHT CANCER INSTITUTE, OREGON HEALTH AND SCIENCE\nUNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OR\nDr. Gray. Senator Grassley, I appreciate the invitation\nfrom you and Senator Wyden and the other members for the\nopportunity to present my views as an academic scientist on the\nforeign threats to taxpayer-funded research.\nMy formal training is in engineering and physics, but I\nhave spent the last 40 years of my research career doing\nbiomedical research, basically working to improve the detection\nand treatment of cancers and other diseases. I began my career\nat the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where I held a\ntop secret clearance. I then moved to positions at the\nUniversity of California San Francisco, Lawrence Berkeley\nNational Laboratory, and now Oregon Health and Sciences\nUniversity. And I participated in several large international\nresearch programs, including the Human Genome and the Cancer\nGenome Atlas projects.\nDuring the course of my career, I have co-authored almost\n500 papers, and I am co-inventor on 80 U.S. patents. It is\nimportant to note that foreign nationals made key contributions\nto many of these, including inventions that were successfully\ncommercialized by U.S. companies.\nAs a consequence of my employment at the Lawrence Livermore\nNational Lab, I am well aware of the need to protect\ninformation that is of strategic importance to the United\nStates. I am also aware of the constraints that strict control\nof information imposes on scientific exchange, innovation, and\nbiomedical translation.\nDuring my time at Livermore, the entry and movement of\nforeign nationals within the laboratory was strictly\ncontrolled, as were my trips to foreign meetings and my\nexchanges with individuals there. I certainly consider my time\nat Livermore to have been scientifically productive. Indeed,\nseveral inventions that have been successfully commercialized\nby U.S. companies were initiated at Livermore, so innovation\ncan and does occur in controlled environments. However, the\nfull development and exploitation of these inventions required\nnational and international interactions that would have been\ndifficult in the constrained Livermore environment. Moreover,\nthe cost in money, time, and efficiency of research in that\ncontrolled environment was extraordinarily high. My move from\nLivermore to the University of California-San Francisco was\nmotivated in part by my desire to escape those constraints.\nInnovation drives scientific and economic growth, and I am\na strong proponent of the idea put forth by Steven Johnson in\nhis book ``Where Good Ideas Come From'' that innovation results\nfrom planned and unplanned interactions between individuals,\nand that the level of innovation increases with the number and\ndiversity of those interactions. Foreign nationals bring\ndifferent educational backgrounds, new skill sets, new ways of\nthinking, and access to new resources and technologies. Their\nparticipation in U.S. research programs increases intellectual\ndiversity and, in so doing, increases innovation. We run the\nrisk of stifling innovation whenever we impose constraints.\nSometimes that is necessary, but I think it needs to be kept to\nan absolute minimum.\nScientists in the U.S. today face many challenges:\nuncertain funding, burdensome requirements for reporting,\nincreasing workplace regulations, and keeping up with the\ndaunting flow of new ideas and data that are being generated\nworldwide. We are successfully dealing with these challenges,\nbut just barely. If additional requirements are put into place\nthat regulate interactions with foreign nationals, the natural\ntendency of many scientists will be to avoid the interactions.\nThis may significantly diminish innovation within the United\nStates.\nMining the unprecedented amount of rich data that are now\nbeing generated worldwide is especially challenging. It is\nimpossible to anticipate at this point how these data might be\nmost effectively used for societal and economic benefit. We\nrely heavily on the international community for help in that.\nIt is equally impossible to anticipate how they might be\nmisused. The controls on data sharing that are now in place do\nprotect against many forms of misuse, and I believe that\nfurther efforts to control access to these data will not have a\nmeasurable impact on their misuse but might have a significant\nnegative impact on their effective use.\nInstead of imposing constraint on interactions, which would\nbe very expensive to implement, I think that we should make it\neasier to protect our intellectual property, accelerate its\ntransfer to the U.S. private sector, and aggressively protect\nthe intellectual property that we do generate using existing\nlegal and political means.\nThe best and brightest scientists in the world come to the\nU.S. to study and work because of our free and open system. I\nbelieve that adding constraints will not effectively deter\nnefarious activities but will diminish innovation, slow the\ndevelopment of solutions to important societal problems, and\nslow U.S. economic growth.\nI think it is very important not to let the transgressions\nof the few, which are real, inhibit the successes of the many.\nThank you.\n[The prepared statement of Dr. Gray appears in the\nappendix.]\nThe Chairman. Thank you, and I will have three questions.\nAnd then I assume that, with four votes, nobody else is going\nto come back to ask questions.\nWe wrote a letter on August 20, 2018, to NIH grantee\ninstitutions. NIH called attention to a series of threats posed\nby foreign entities to the integrity of our biomedical\nresearch. In that letter, NIH warned that foreign actors have,\nquote, ``mounted systematic programs to influence NIH\nresearchers and peer reviewers,'' end of quote, but may have\nalso worked to divert intellectual property produced by NIH-\nsupported research to other countries and may have contributed\nresources to NIH-funded researchers in ways that could impact\nthe integrity.\nSo with that background, Dr. Gray, given the strong\nevidence presented by the first panel that foreign governments\nand foreign actors have succeeded in efforts to improperly\ninfluence researchers and taxpayer-funded research, would you\nagree that we need more robust vetting procedures and\nprocesses?\nDr. Gray. I certainly acknowledge that there have been\nmisuses of data and intellectual property. And I do agree that\nthere needs to be vigorous enforcement of laws that punish\nindividuals and countries that participate in that.\nThe issue of whether or not we should impose additional\nvetting is a difficult one, because the process of doing this\nvetting in essence stigmatizes the whole community that is\nbeing vetted. And so in doing that, it decreases their\nenthusiasm for actually coming to the United States to work\nwith us to advance our scientific ideas.\nIn essence, what I am worried about is that it will\ndiminish our own ability in the United States to innovate. And\nthat is a problem. The United States comprises 5 percent of the\npopulation of the world, and we draw the best minds from all of\nthe world. And what we do not want to do is to diminish our\nbrain gain by making it unattractive for those individuals to\ncome to the United States and work with us to solve our\nsocietal problems and to help us form the companies that are\nreally, quite frankly, driving the U.S. economy today.\nThe Chairman. My second question may be a little easier for\nyou to answer, and I know the sincerity of your answer. I guess\nyou know where I am coming from. I believe that there needs to\nbe more vetting.\nThe second question is: have you personally experienced any\nof those foreign-government efforts?\nDr. Gray. So I have not personally experienced any efforts\non the part of a foreign government, to my knowledge, to\nillegally acquire any information that I have been in the\nprocess of generating. That said, we go out of our way to make\ngenomic and other comparable data available to the world.\nAnd the reason for that is that we are in the very early\nstages of even beginning to understand how to interpret those\ndata. And it takes the minds of many, many people to come up\nwith the best ways of wringing the knowledge that one can get\nout of that data, and there are a lot of international efforts\nin which we participate, actually, that deliberately make the\ndata available and ask the scientific community to help us\nsolve vexing problems.\nAnd one of the things that becomes clear from those efforts\nis that the wisdom of the crowd is smarter than the wisdom of\nany individual. And so having more minds think about these\ncomplex data sets is actually advantageous to us in trying to\nsolve the problems that we generated the data to solve in the\nfirst place.\nThe Chairman. The last question. If you found that one of\nyour researchers on a taxpayer-funded project failed to\ndisclose foreign financial contributions, what would you do?\nDr. Gray. I think that one of the things that is not clear\ntoday, to me at least, is the extent to which information needs\nto be disclosed. The rules on that are changing, and have\nchanged over the last while, and so I think at this point in\ntime the answer would be, I would counsel them on how to do a\nbetter job of disclosing the information.\nIf I thought that the information was being disclosed for\nsome nefarious activity, I think that that would be grounds for\ntermination. But for the most part, people are often not clear\nabout the exact rules about what needs to be disclosed, about\nthe extent to which it needs to be disclosed. And so, until\nthat gets clarified, then I think that we are going to be\nunable to probably comply with what you would like to see\ndisclosed.\nThe Chairman. Okay. I thank you for your testimony and for\ncoming a long distance, and thank you for your research and\nwhat you are doing.\nThe hearing is adjourned.\nDr. Gray. Thank you for the opportunity.\nThe Chairman. You bet.\n[Whereupon, at 11:35, a.m., the hearing was concluded.]\nA P P E N D I X\nAdditional Material Submitted for the Record\n----------\nPrepared Statement of Hon. Chuck Grassley,\na U.S. Senator From Iowa\nGood morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to the Finance\nCommittee's hearing on foreign threats to taxpayer-funded research.\nTaxpayer-funded research has been integral in keeping American medical,\ndefense, information technology, and many other products at the\nforefront of the world's market.\nSimply said, the United States is the best of the best when it\ncomes to conducting cutting edge medical research. Our scientists push\nthe envelope to make crucial discoveries and better products, whether\nit be vaccines, or other medical treatments and intellectual property.\nThese projects can produce important breakthroughs for patients and\nindustry--for the United States and the world.\nWe didn't develop this reputation overnight. We earned it, through\nthe persistent hard work and dedication of researchers across the\ncountry. I'd like to call that a good old-fashioned American work\nethic.\nI thank them for their service to our country and want them to know\nthat this committee's oversight isn't designed to interfere with the\npursuit of knowledge and the free exchange of information in the\nresearch field. Rather, this committee's oversight is intended to\nstrengthen the integrity of taxpayer-funded research and to preserve\nour valuable work product.\nTruly free collaboration and exchange of information is only\npossible when data and sources are credible and the research process\ncan be trusted. That trust is destroyed when foreign governments and\nother entities interfere in our research for their gain and to our\ndetriment. Accordingly, Congress, the executive branch, and research\ninstitutions, must work together to properly balance the robust\ndevelopment and exchange of ideas in the research field with reasonable\nand proportionate common-sense efforts to protect the integrity of the\nresearch.\nThat's why I've engaged in oversight efforts in this field.\nBeginning in October of last year, I wrote to the National Institutes\nof Health, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Health\nand Human Services Inspector General about threats to taxpayer-funded\nresearch. Since then, I've also written to the National Science\nFoundation and the Department of Defense.\nToday, we will focus on foreign threats to research funded by the\nNational Institutes of Health, its granting process, and downstream\ngrantees. Those threats include spying, theft of intellectual property,\ndisclosure of confidential information, and other related efforts that\nundermine the integrity of research.\nThe NIH spends $39 billion of taxpayer money each year on medical\nresearch. The American people worked hard for that money. And the\npeople deserve to know how the government is working to protect that\nresearch and the resulting intellectual property from foreign threats.\nWe know that China is by far the most prolific offender; however\nthey aren't the only country acting against our interests. In October\n2018, while chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I held a hearing on\nChina's non-traditional espionage against the United States. During\nthat hearing, I broached the issue of China's focus on our research\ninstitutions and taxpayer-funded research. Today, we can get into more\ndetail regarding those threats.\nIt's without dispute that China has focused its energy on\nleveraging our hard work for their benefit--and to our detriment. One\nexample hits home for me. In 2011, Chinese nationals tried to steal\ngenetically modified corn seeds from Iowa. They tried to ship them back\nto China. Those seeds were the product of years of research and\ndevelopment. The Chinese Government says they're ``picking flowers in\nforeign lands to make honey in China.'' I believe them.\nWhether we're talking about Confucius Institutes spreading\npropaganda on college campuses, China's ``Talent Programs'' that have\nbeen called ``brain gain'' programs, or China planting spies in our\nindustry, the government of China is a serious problem. In 2013,\nChinese nationals were charged with conspiring to steal research funded\nby a multi-million dollar NIH grant for the benefit of a Chinese\ngovernmental entity and a direct competitor of the American university\nwhere the research was conducted.\nIn an August 20, 2018, letter to NIH grantee institutions, NIH\ncalled attention to a series of threats posed by foreign entities to\nthe integrity of U.S. biomedical research. In that letter, NIH warned\nthat foreign actors have ``mounted systematic programs to influence NIH\nresearchers and peer reviewers,'' may have worked to divert\nintellectual property produced by NIH-supported research to other\ncountries, and may have contributed resources to NIH-funded researchers\nin ways which could impact the integrity of the research.\nIn January of this year, the HHS Inspector General notified me that\nNIH recently made 12 referrals in this area to the Inspector General.\nThose referrals primarily involved principal investigators--essentially\nthe primary researchers--on NIH grants conducting medical research at\nU.S. universities. Those researchers allegedly failed to meet NIH\nrequirements to disclose foreign affiliations on their grant\napplications. That's a serious problem.\nResearchers who are secretly supported by a foreign government\nwhile working on U.S. research projects can be more susceptible to the\ninfluence and control of the foreign parent. We must know who is\nfinancially supporting researchers to better understand whether they\nmight be more dedicated to securing the interests of an adversary than\nto rigorous scientific and medical advancement.\nOur witnesses can speak to those specific threats and the\ngovernment's capabilities to detect and deter them. Today, we have\nwitnesses from the National Institutes of Health, the Health and Human\nServices Office of National Security, the Health and Human Services\nInspector General, and the Department of Homeland Security.\nThe FBI was invited by the committee, given that they are a\ncritical aspect to counterintelligence efforts in this field. The\ncommittee invited them on April 30th. That's 26 business days before\nthe hearing date. On May 6th, the FBI said it would be ``unable to\nparticipate'' in the hearing but failed to explain why. My staff\nfollowed up via email and phone. On May 7th, the FBI reiterated that\nthey would not be able to appear but again failed to explain why. On\nMay 16th, the FBI responded via email and said the\n``Counterintelligence Division respectfully declines the hearing\ninvite,'' yet again failing to explain why. On May 23rd, I wrote a\nletter to the FBI again inviting their attendance. On May 29th, the FBI\nresponded in writing and stated that it ``does not have a witness\navailable to attend the hearing and briefing.''\nAfter just about 1 month of communications between the FBI and my\nstaff, the FBI failed at every turn to explain why the entire\nCounterintelligence Division did not have a single employee available\nto attend today's hearing. That's inexcusable, and it's a shame. What a\nwasted opportunity for them to explain to this committee and the\nAmerican people what they're doing to help these agencies detect and\ndeter threats to our research.\nThe American people deserve more than a stiff-arm from the FBI.\nHowever, I appreciate the cooperation of the expert witnesses who are\nhere today and I look forward to a robust conversation.\nGenerally speaking, there are four main issues relating to\ntaxpayer-funded research that we will touch on:\n1.  Failure to Disclose: Some researchers hired to work on U.S.\nresearch projects haven't disclosed that they've received\nfinancial contributions from foreign countries.\n2.  Espionage: Some researchers are spies, and their only\npurpose is to infiltrate taxpayer-funded research projects to\nsteal intellectual property and bring it to their home country.\n3.  Vetting: The Federal Government doesn't vet all researchers\nhired by U.S. institutions to work on taxpayer-funded research,\nand neither do the institutions.\n4.  Integrity: Some peer reviewers have shared confidential\ninformation from grant applications with foreign governments,\nwhich would allow them to potentially skip research steps. Some\nhave also attempted to influence funding decisions, undermining\nthe integrity of taxpayer-funded research.\nThese threats to our research are ongoing, aggressive, and real.\nThe question is, does the government have the capabilities to detect\nthese threats, combat them, and deter them to protect our research and\nany intellectual property created from it?\nToday is an opportunity for the witnesses to engage in a frank\ndiscussion about what that threat is and what we in Congress and the\nexecutive branch can do together to solve the problem. Congress and the\nexecutive branch must be on the same page. So, if you believe there are\nlegislative and policy solutions that will assist you with your already\ndifficult jobs, now is the time to bring them forward.\nI look forward to a robust discussion today on these matters. After\nthis morning's hearing, the committee will move this afternoon to a\nclassified briefing on the same subject matter. I strongly encourage\nthe witnesses to take advantage of the highly classified environment to\nprovide as much information to the committee as possible.\n______\nPrepared Statement of Joe W. Gray, Ph.D., Gordon Moore Chair of\nBiomedical Engineering; and Associate Director for Biophysical\nOncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University\nSenator Grassley and members of the committee, thank you for the\nopportunity to present my views on aspects of foreign threats to\ntaxpayer-funded research. I am the Gordon Moore chair of biomedical\nengineering and associate director for biophysical oncology in the\nKnight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health and Science University. My\nformal training is in engineering and physics, but I have spent my\nresearch career of more than 40 years in biomedical research,\ndeveloping and deploying advanced measurement technologies to elucidate\nthe mechanisms that are important in the development and treatment of\ncancer and other diseases.\nI have participated in aspects of several large-scale international\nresearch programs such as the Human Genome Sequencing Project, the NIH\nCancer Genome Atlas project, NCI Cancer Systems Biology projects, and\nthe NCI Cancer Moonshot program. All of these projects have benefited\nfrom the work of foreign nationals and from robust international data\nexchange. During the course of my career, I have published nearly 500\npapers, and I am a co-inventor on 80 U.S. patents. Importantly, foreign\nnationals made key contributions to many of these. In fact, scientists\nfrom Finland, Canada, Japan, and Russia were co-inventors on some the\nmost important including several that were successfully commercialized\nby U.S. companies.\nI began my career at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\nwhere I held a top-secret security clearance. I then moved to faculty\nand research positions at the University of California San Francisco,\nthe Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and now Oregon Health and\nScience University.\nAs a consequence of my employment at the Lawrence Livermore\nNational Laboratory, I am well aware of the need to protect information\nthat is of strategic importance to the United States. I am also aware\nof the constraints that the strict control of information imposes on\nscientific exchange, innovation and translation to improved patient\noutcomes. During my time at Livermore, the entry and movement of\nforeign nationals within the laboratory was strictly controlled as were\nmy trips to meetings in foreign countries. The administrative and\nfinancial cost of these monitoring efforts was substantial.\nI certainly consider my time at Livermore to have been\nscientifically productive. Indeed, several of my most significant\ninventions that have been successfully commercialized by U.S. companies\nwere initiated at Livermore. So, innovation can and does occur in\ncontrolled environments.\nHowever, the full development and exploitation of these inventions\nrequired national and international interactions that would have been\ndifficult in the constrained Livermore environment. It was also clear\nthat the cost in money, time and efficiency of doing research in this\ncontrolled environment was extraordinarily high. In fact, my move from\nLivermore to the University of California San Francisco was motivated\nin part by my desire to achieve relief from these controls.\nI am a strong proponent of the idea put forth by Steven Johnson in\nhis book, ``Where Good Ideas Come From,'' that innovation results from\nthe integration of ideas and facts that arise through planned and\nunplanned interactions with other individuals. I also support his\ncontention that the level of innovation increases with the number and\ndiversity of those interactions. We run the risk of stifling innovation\nwhenever we constrain interactions. Sometimes that is necessary but it\nshould be kept to an absolute minimum.\nIt has been my experience that the way people approach problems is\ncolored strongly by their past experiences and by the nature of their\neducation. It is also my experience that individuals educated in other\ncountries bring different ways of thinking and different facts.\nFurther, these individuals undergo extensive vetting to ensure a high\nlevel of education and potential. Thus, I believe that innovative\nsolutions to the complex problems we are trying to solve throughout the\nbiomedical community today will occur most rapidly through the free and\nopen exchange of information and ideas, including with a broad range of\nforeign nationals.\nI believe that scientific innovation is one of the cornerstones of\neconomic growth in the United States. I also believe that regulatory\nconstraints that interfere with the free exchange of information and\nideas will substantially decrease our level of innovation and therefore\nour economic and scientific competitiveness.\nScientists in the United States today face many challenges. These\ninclude uncertain funding, burdensome requirements for reporting,\nincreasing workplace regulations and keeping up with the daunting flow\nof new ideas and data that are being generated worldwide. We are still\nsuccessfully dealing with these challenges but just barely. Should\nadditional requirements be put in place that regulate interactions with\nforeign nationals, the natural tendency of many scientists will be to\navoid the interactions. I believe that this will significantly diminish\ninnovation within the United States.\nIt is also important to know that many remarkable measurement tools\nnow being developed around the world are providing an unprecedented\namount of rich information about normal and diseased tissues,\ninformation that can be mined to yield new insights into disease\nprevention, detection and treatment. It is impossible to anticipate at\nthis point how these data might be most effectively interpreted. It is\nequally impossible to anticipate how these data might be misused. The\ncontrols on data sharing that are now in place do protect against most\nforms of data misuse and I believe that efforts to further control\naccess to these data will not have a measurable impact on data misuse\nbut will have a significant negative impact on innovation.\nIn sum, I believe that the economic strength of the United States\ndepends on innovation and on the speedy implementation and\ncommercialization of innovative ideas. I believe that the controls that\nare already in place provide a workable balance between protecting data\nand intellectual property and allowing the free exchange of data and\ninformation needed for effective innovation. I believe that additional\nefforts to control interactions with foreign nationals will decrease\ninnovation and, in so doing, will diminish the economic power of the\nUnited States and will have little impact on foreign misappropriation\nand misuse of information and ideas. Most innovative ideas and data\nwill in any case eventually become available through the published\nliterature and in published patents and so will be available for\nmisuse. Instead of imposing constraints on innovation, which would be\nvery expensive to implement, I advocate for adding supports to make it\neasier to protect the intellectual property that is generated with\ntaxpayer dollars. I also recommend supporting the rapid and efficient\ntransfer of information from academia to the private sector as well as\nbetween researchers worldwide so that maximum benefit can occur from\nthe massive new technological advances and the big data being\ngenerated.\nThere are many barriers now in place to the kinds of technology\ntransfer that will enable us to rapidly exploit academic innovations. I\nbelieve that our efforts would be best spent in reducing these\nbarriers. This includes providing support for intellectual property\ndevelopment and substantially increasing support for early-phase\nbusiness developments. In the end, economic success will come from\nrapid innovation and development, and aggressive protection of\nintellectual property using existing legal and political tools. The\nmisappropriation of data and ideas is serious but should be dealt with\nthrough already existing legal and political means and not by placing\nconstraints on the free information and idea exchange on which the U.S.\ncompetitive advantage depends.\nI believe the best and most intelligent scientists in the world\ncome to the United States to study and work because of our free and\nopen system. Additional constraints will not effectively deter\nnefarious activities but will diminish innovation and U.S. economic\ngrowth. It is very important to not let the transgressions of a few\ninhibit the successes of the many.\n______\nQuestions Submitted for the Record to Joe W. Gray, Ph.D.\nQuestions Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden\nQuestion. Essential Value of Foreign Researchers: Dr. Alicia\nCarriquiry, president's chair in statistics and distinguished professor\nat Iowa State University, has stated that ``without foreign-born\nresearchers, the entire system of higher education in the United States\nwould collapse in a minute.'' Do you agree with Dr. Carriquiry's\nassessment of the importance of foreign-born researchers for U.S.\nmedical science and our system of higher education?\nAnswer. I do agree with Dr. Carriquiry's assessment. The importance\nof foreign-born researchers to the United States scientific and health-\ncare enterprise cannot be overstated. Since World War II, the United\nStates has been the most popular destination for science and\nengineering students who choose to study abroad. Many of these\nindividuals stay in the United States and make their lives here,\ncontributing in profound ways both to society and to the U.S. economy.\nThis openness to immigration has helped make the U.S. a world leader in\nscience and technology. However, short-sighted domestic policy\nthreatens both our research and development system and our economy.\nForeign-born entrepreneurs helped start one-fourth of all new U.S.\nengineering and technology businesses between 1995 and 2005, including\nGoogle and eBay. As I stated in my testimony, the best and most\nintelligent scientists in the world come to the U.S. today to study and\nwork because of our free and open system. Importantly, we keep the best\nand most impactful here after they complete their training. They serve\nas a key part of the U.S. ``innovation engine'' that drives our\neconomy. In my view, additional constraints will not effectively deter\nnefarious activities but will diminish innovation and U.S. economic\ngrowth.\nQuestion. Role of Foreign Researchers in Developing U.S. Patents/\nIntellectual Property: The most recent data from the U.S. Patent and\nTrademark Office shows that more than 50 percent of patents granted are\nheld by foreigners--either as the primary inventor or co-inventor. Your\nown work is described in more than 80 patents. To what extent would\nthat work and those patents have been possible without the aid of\nforeign researchers and what discoveries might have remained unearthed\nin the absence of those researchers?\nAnswer. Foreign researchers were co-inventors and key innovators on\napproximately half of my issued U.S. patents. The foreign researchers\nwere key to our being first and to the issuance of U.S. patents that\nwere subsequently licensed to U.S. companies. Had we not been first, it\nis likely that the discoveries would have been made by researchers in\nother countries and led to their commercial development there. The key\ncontribution of foreign researchers is also apparent in many of the\nhigh-impact scientific research programs I have had the opportunity to\ncontribute to in my career. These include the Human Genome Sequencing\nProject, the National Institutes of Health's Cancer Genome Atlas\nproject, the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Systems Biology\nprojects, and the Cancer Moonshot program. The innovations taking place\nin these important programs are advancing our ability to understand and\nmitigate the impact of many aspects of human disease. This is important\nto the well-being of U.S. citizens and citizens of the world. The\nsolutions are, of course, enabled by commercial developments and these\nwill be made by companies that learn about them first and that have the\nskilled leaders and workers to execute on development. This now happens\nin the U.S. because the discoveries are made here and because we have\nthe skilled workers for development. Foreign scientists and\ntechnologists in U.S. laboratories and companies are essential to these\nactivities.\nQuestion. Other Threats to U.S. Research: Foreign students are\nbecoming a more and more important source of tuition for U.S. colleges\nand universities due to State and Federal funding cuts. A recent study\nby the Association of International Educators noted that over a million\nforeign students attended U.S. colleges and universities in the 2017-\n2018 academic year and contributed an estimated $39 billion to the U.S.\neconomy. On the other hand, President Trump's fiscal year 2020 budget\nrequest would cut NIH funding by nearly $5 billion compared to fiscal\nyear 2019 funding levels. Given that the bulk of OHSU's research awards\ncome from NIH, what kind of an effect would decreased NIH funding have\non the scientific output of your laboratory, your university and U.S.\nuniversities overall?\nAnswer. Approximately half of the research in my research program\ncomes from the NIH. This research is directed primarily at developing\nmore durable and tolerable treatments for metastatic cancers. The work\nis quite promising and takes advantage of the remarkable amount of new\ndata being generated around the world. However, converting data into\nknowledge and biomedical insight requires a lot of ``thinking time.''\nI, like most scientists in the U.S. today, spend far too much time\nwriting grant proposals, preparing progress reports for successful\ngrants, worrying about job security and complying with an increasing\nnumber of regulatory requirements instead of thinking about science so\nwe can make progress. Young U.S.-born scientists see this and are\nshying away from science as a consequence. Decreasing the NIH budget\nwill continue this trend so that discoveries that we could be making\nwill be discovered first in other countries by foreign researchers who\nare better supported.\nThis is being played out at OHSU and in universities across the\ncountry. OHSU, Oregon's only academic medical center, relies heavily on\nNIH funding to carry out life-saving research. In 2018, OHSU scientists\nreceived more than $245 million in NIH funding, across 486 awards.\nWhile Congress has increased NIH funding in recent years, total funding\nas a share of GDP is still 12 percent below that of 2003. Far from\ncutting NIH funding, it is critical that we increase support for basic\nand translational research, which in turn drives economic growth in\ncommunities across the country. NIH funding supported nearly 380,000\njobs and $65 billion in economic activity in 2016 alone.\nWhile it is tempting to focus on the direct value to foreign\nstudents and U.S. research, I believe that it is more important to\nfocus on the larger value that these students make to the U.S. economy.\nMany of the best and brightest of these students stay in the U.S. and\ncontribute to academic medicine and to the development of biotechnology\nand pharmaceutical industries--the combined market value of which is\napproaching $1 trillion.\nQuestion. Administrative Burden: You mentioned the administrative\nburden additional regulatory constraints could have on innovation in\nyour lab. We know that, according to the National Science Foundation,\ntop researchers in the United States spend 50 percent of their time\nwriting grants. Yet, in 2016, only 17 percent of NIH grant applications\nwere approved. Can you give examples of current administrative burdens\nyou face and please explain the amount of time you and researchers in\nyour lab spend on paperwork (grants, etc.), as well as the additional\ncosts you anticipate should the Federal Government impose additional\nconstraints--like vetting requirements--on your research?\nAnswer. My research is heavily oriented toward ``translation.''\nThat is, elucidation of aspects of biology and technology that we need\nto improve cancer care. This is fundamentally a team science effort and\nrequires organization of and participation in local, national, and\ninternational meetings that are needed to move projects forward. The\ninteractions that occur during these meetings are both planned and\nspontaneous with all participants contributing new ideas as they occur.\nMany good ideas occur spontaneously during the course of discussions\nand so are impossible to anticipate. The ideas are innovative only in\nthe context of the discussion and so are impossible to vet. It seems\nthe only way to ensure that individuals do not receive information\ndeemed sensitive would be to exclude them from meetings where sensitive\ntopics would be discussed. This would then require a detailed\nassessment of topics that might be sensitive. I expect compiling such a\nlist would be enormously time consuming and would require a detailed\nassessment of future U.S. economic strategy. This is certainly not\nsomething that universities have the resources to undertake. If such a\nlist were compiled by a collection of Federal agencies, it would have\nto be updated continuously and the information communicated to all\nuniversities and other research institutions so that risk assessment\ncould be made. This would be an enormous and ongoing risk education\nprocess. Any time spent learning about risk would be time not spent\nthinking.\nIn direct answer to the question, I estimate conservatively that I\nalready spend 75 percent of my time on aspects of science\nadministration. That time includes preparing grant proposals; preparing\nprogress reports for grants that are successful; clinical trials\nreporting; complying with FDA guidelines; seeking support from industry\nand philanthropy to supplement, extend, or commercialize our research\nfindings; participating or coordinating phone calls and face-to-face\nmeetings; and organizing data and managing data sharing rules so it can\nbe analyzed by ourselves and by the international community. Adding\ncontinual risk assessment to the set of tasks I now do would bring my\nscientific program to a halt. The only practical way around that would\nbe to exclude foreign researchers from the laboratory which I believe\nwould eliminate access to some of the best minds in the world, reduce\naccess to important data and destroy our ability to compete with the\nbest and brightest in the world.\n______\nQuestion Submitted by Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse\nQuestion. The competition for global scientific talent is growing.\nDoes the United States risk falling behind other countries if our visa\nrules and processes diminish our ability to recruit the best and\nbrightest global talent?\nAnswer. The United States absolutely risks falling behind other\nnations. In order to maintain its competitive edge, the U.S. must do\nmore to attract international talent, not less. Policy measures that\ndiscourage foreign researchers from fully contributing to our\nscientific endeavors will reduce American competiveness. The economic\nstrength of the United States depends on innovation and on the speedy\nimplementation and commercialization of innovative ideas. The controls\nthat are already in place provide a workable balance between protecting\ndata and intellectual property and allowing the free exchange of data\nand information. Additional efforts to control interactions with\nforeign nationals will decrease innovation and, in so doing, will\ndiminish the economic power of the U.S., while having little impact on\nforeign misappropriation and misuse of information and ideas. The best\nway to make the U.S. more competitive economically is to increase the\ninnovation engine through increased NIH funding, to make funds\navailable to support protection of intellectual property and to\nencourage early phase startup companies in the U.S. so that discoveries\nare translated rapidly and successfully. The small loss to nefarious\nactivities will be far outweighed by the resulting economic gain.\nI will close with an analogy: people speed when they drive. We\ndon't solve that problem by putting governors on cars. We enact laws to\npunish those who speed.\n______\nPrepared Statement of Leslie W. Hollie, Chief of Investigative\nOperations, Office of Inspector General, Department of Health and Human\nServices\nGood morning, Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Wyden, and\ndistinguished members of the committee. I am Leslie W. Hollie, Chief of\nInvestigative Operations with the Department of Health and Human\nServices (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG). I appreciate the\nopportunity to appear before you to discuss how HHS-OIG is diligently\nworking, in conjunction with our HHS and law enforcement partners,\nprotect taxpayer-funded medical research.\nOIG is charged with overseeing all HHS programs and operations. We\ncombat fraud, waste, and abuse in those programs; promote their\nefficiency, economy, and effectiveness; and protect the beneficiaries\nthey serve. To accomplish this, OIG employs tools such as data\nanalysis, audits, evaluations, and investigations. We are a\nmultidisciplinary organization comprised of investigators, auditors,\nevaluators, analysts, clinicians, and attorneys. We depend on our\nstrong public and private partnerships to ensure coordinated\nenforcement success.\nThe Office of Investigations is the law enforcement component of\nOIG that investigates fraud and abuse against HHS programs. Our special\nagents have full law enforcement authority and effect a broad range of\nactions, including the execution of search warrants and arrests. We use\ntraditional as well as state-of-the art investigative techniques and\ninnovative data analysis to fulfill our mission.\nintroduction\nToday, I will cover how OIG enhances the Federal Government's\nability to detect, deter, and take enforcement action to ensure the\nintegrity of taxpayer-funded medical research against foreign threats.\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) has recently referred to\nOIG for investigation 16 \\1\\ allegations of noncompliance with its\nterms and conditions for receiving a medical research grant. The\nallegations primarily deal with the failure of principal investigators\nto disclose foreign government affiliations. Because these referrals\nare all still active, to avoid compromising ongoing investigations, I\ncannot provide further details at this time. However, I can cover how\nwe generally handle grant fraud allegations related to taxpayer-funded\nmedical research.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ This number includes four additional referrals from NIH since\nour January 31, 2019 letter of response to Chairman Grassley's January\n17, 2019 letter on the topic in which we reported having a dozen such\ncomplaints on hand.\nAlthough foreign theft of taxpayer-funded medical research is a\nhigh-profile, complex issue, the cases under our purview all involve\naspects of grant fraud--something which OIG has extensive experience\ninvestigating. HHS is the largest grant-making organization and third-\nlargest contracting agency in the Federal Government. It is also the\nsecond-largest payer under the Small Business Innovation Research\n(SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. Given\nthis nexus, OIG has made oversight and enforcement of grant fraud and\nrelated grant program integrity a priority.\nproactive grant fraud education, with enforcement when needed\nWe take a two-pronged approach to preventing and acting against\ngrant fraud. First, OIG works collaboratively to educate key\nstakeholders--including HHS operating divisions and Grant Recipient\nOrganizations--on ways to detect and prevent grant fraud through\nproactive training. Second, we take action, when needed, against grant\nfraud by investigating allegations of criminal misconduct and making\nappropriate referrals for criminal, civil, or administrative action.\nOIG receives allegations of grant fraud or uncovers potential fraud\nin a variety of ways, including OIG hotline complaints, referrals from\nHHS operating divisions and law enforcement partners, whistleblower\ndisclosures, and proactive data analysis. In addition to our standard\nhotline, we also provide a ``grant and contract portal'' especially for\nHHS employees to refer grant and contract matters to OIG.\nUpon receiving an allegation pertaining to grant fraud involving\nNIH or other HHS operating division, OIG evaluates the allegation and\ndetermines whether we will open an investigation; refer the matter to\nanother agency with appropriate authorities; or, when appropriate,\nrefer the matter back to the HHS operating division involved for\nadministrative review and potential action.\nWhen evaluating referrals involving allegations of foreign threats\nto taxpayer-funded medical research, OIG is sensitive to the fact that\nacademic and professional reputations could easily be damaged by\nerroneous allegations. All complaints are treated with confidentiality\nand discretion and we only proceed with investigations when sufficient\nfactual information supports such investigative activity. When OIG\nidentifies a violation of civil or criminal law during an\ninvestigation, OIG presents the facts to the Department of Justice\n(DOJ) for prosecutorial consideration.\nTo protect the integrity of medical research, OIG coordinates with\nthe HHS Office of National Security (ONS). In some instances, OIG works\non matters with the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI's) Joint\nTerrorism Task Forces and National Cyber Investigative Joint Task\nForce, the Department of Homeland Security, and components at FBI\nHeadquarters and local field offices. When appropriate, we work\ntogether with NIH and ONS to develop follow-up approaches and\nmitigation strategies for such cases.\nTo illustrate the types of grant fraud investigations OIG conducts,\nI will offer two summaries of recently resolved research integrity\ninvestigative cases.\nA doctor who worked in a laboratory at Iowa State University,\nwhich received research grants for an experimental HIV/AIDS\nvaccine, falsified scientific data to make it appear an\nexperimental HIV/AIDS vaccine neutralized, or controlled, the\nHIV/AIDS virus in rabbits, and contaminated rabbit blood\nsamples with human antibodies to make it appear the rabbits\nproduced neutralizing antibodies against the HIV/AIDS virus.\nThe data from these actions were used in a grant application\nand progress reports to NIH. The doctor was sentenced to 57\nmonths in Federal prison, 3 years of supervised release, and\n$7.2 million restitution.\nAnother doctor founded two companies, GenPhar and Vaxima, to\nperform research and produce a vaccine for diseases such as\nEbola, Marburg Virus, and Dengue Virus. GenPhar and Vaxima\nobtained Federal grant money (including NIH SBIR funds) for\nbiodefense research and vaccine development, but actually used\nthe funds for other purposes, including construction of a\ncommercial office building and to pay lobbyists and others who\nwere seeking to secure more Federal funding on the doctor's\nbehalf. The doctor was sentenced to 70 months in Federal prison\nand ordered to pay over $3 million in restitution.\nAs mentioned earlier, OIG's approach to preventing and enforcing\ngrant fraud includes working collaboratively with stakeholders to\nincrease their ability to detect and prevent grant fraud through\nproactive training. OIG works with representatives of the intelligence\ncommunity and HHS's Office of Research Integrity (ORI) to promote\nawareness of research misconduct and helps with efforts to improve\nprotections. For instance, before I received the invitation to testify\nhere today, I was scheduled to deliver a joint presentation along with\nan ORI colleague entitled ``When Research Misconduct Involves Potential\nCriminal Behavior: New Collaboration Strengthens Protection of U.S.\nBiomedical Research Funding.'' In addition to such joint training\nefforts, ORI notifies OIG when conduct that might be criminal activity\narises in the course of a research misconduct investigation. OIG's work\nis independent of ORI's, and ORI must refer all credible allegations of\ncriminal conduct they uncover to OIG. In short, OIG's enhanced\ncollaboration with ORI adds a layer of scrutiny to ensure that both ORI\nand OIG can take appropriate actions to protect U.S. biomedical\nresearch investments.\nOIG increases HHS employee, contractor, and grantee awareness of\nhow to identify and report allegations pertaining to grant fraud as\nwell as foreign threats to taxpayer-funded medical research through\ntraining and presentations. For instance, OIG has provided numerous\ngrant fraud training sessions at NIH Regional Seminars and NIH SBIR and\nSTTR Town Hall meetings.\nTo educate grant recipient organizations, OIG has partnered with\nseveral academic entities to address best practices to ensure Research\nIntegrity Officers and Compliance Officers are informed on the roles,\nresponsibilities, and authorities of OIG. We tailor our efforts for\neach grant recipient organization to address what best practices are\nmost helpful to serve its unique needs.\nrisk mitigation through minimizing vulnerabilities\nOIG conducts oversight of NIH through audits and evaluations, some\nof which relate to protecting the integrity of NIH-funded research. In\nfiscal year 2019, OIG received $5 million in appropriations for\noversight of grant programs and operations of NIH, including NIH\nefforts to ensure the integrity of its grant application evaluation and\nselection processes.\\2\\ We have evaluations underway to assess NIH's\nvetting and oversight of its peer reviewers, including its efforts to\nprevent or identify inappropriate disclosure of information by peer\nreviewers, and an evaluation of how NIH monitors the financial\nconflicts of interest (including foreign financial interests) reported\nby grantee institutions. In addition, we are examining NIH's adherence\nto its policies for evaluating and selecting grant applications.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\2\\ The Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services,\nand Education Appropriations Act, 2019 and Continuing Appropriations\nAct, 2019 (Public Law No. 115-245). As required by this law, OIG\nsubmitted a comprehensive NIH oversight plan to the Committee on\nAppropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate; the\nSenate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions; and the\nHouse Committee on Energy and Commerce.\nOIG is also initiating audits that will assess NIH's Institutes and\nCenters to review their (1) pre-award process for assessing risk of\npotential recipients of Federal funds; (2) policies, procedures, and\ncontrols in place for ensuring that both foreign and domestic grantees\ndisclose all relevant affiliations, sources of support, and financial\ninterests, including intellectual property interests; (3) internal\ncontrols for identifying and addressing potentially duplicative grant\nfunding and overlap; (4) testing of select cybersecurity controls\nwithin the NIH Electronic Health Records system; and (5) controls to\nensure that NIH has an accurate inventory of hardware, software, and\nInternet Protocol resources.\nconclusion\nOIG is committed to working collaboratively to address foreign\nthreats to taxpayer-funded medical research through preventive efforts\nto mitigate risk and minimize vulnerabilities in HHS programs and\nconducting enforcement actions whenever necessary. In cooperation with\nour HHS and law enforcement partners, OIG will continue to leverage our\ngrant fraud investigative work and capabilities to maximize our efforts\nin this area as authorities, resources, and funding allow.\nThank you for your ongoing leadership in this area and for\naffording me the opportunity to discuss this important topic with you.\n______\nQuestions Submitted for the Record to Leslie W. Hollie\nQuestions Submitted by Hon. Chuck Grassley\nQuestion. According to the Health and Human Services Inspector\nGeneral, NIH has recently referred for investigation a 16 allegations\nof noncompliance related to medical research. The Inspector General\nstated the allegations primarily deal with the failure of principal\nresearchers to disclose foreign government affiliations.\nWhere do those referrals from NIH currently stand? Were any\ninvestigations opened or matters referred to other agencies, such as\nthe FBI? If so, how many and to what agency?\nAnswer. The referrals that OIG received from the National\nInstitutes of Health (NIH) have all become open and active\ninvestigations. Therefore, we cannot provide further details at this\ntime.\nQuestion. According to NIH, it operates both the intramural program\nand the extramural program for research activities. Within the\nintramural program, NIH's employees, contractors, and affiliates who\nare U.S. citizens undergo background investigations. Further, prior to\nthat background check, a Special Agency Check is conducted requiring\nfingerprints to be cross-checked with FBI criminal databases including\nterrorist watch lists. According to NIH, a grantee institution in the\nextramural program, such as a university or other research institution,\nis responsible for any vetting, not NIH.\nMore than $8 out of $10 appropriated to NIH goes to the extramural\nprogram. At the committee hearing, I asked Dr. Tabak whether NIH\nconducts background checks, including a review for counter-intel\npurposes, on Principal Investigators prior to awarding a grantee\ninstitution taxpayer money. He answered, ``No sir, we do not, as they\nare employees of their home institution.''\nIf principal investigators were subject to the same background\ncheck as NIH employees, and were also subject to a review for\ncounterintelligence purposes, how would those checks help strengthen\ngrant integrity?\nAnswer. OIG has found that background checks can be an important\ntool for program integrity in certain contexts, such as for high-risk\nproviders in Medicare. We have not assessed the costs and benefits of\nrequiring background checks for NIH principal investigators. Given the\nnumber of principal investigators funded by NIH, conducting background\nchecks for all of them would likely present logistical and resource\nchallenges. In general, OIG supports using risk-based approaches to\nmaximizing the impact of program integrity investments.\nQuestion. If principal investigators were subject to the same\nbackground check as NIH employees, and were also subject to a review\nfor counterintelligence purposes, would those checks improve the\ngovernment's security posture? If so, how? If not, why not?\nAnswer. OIG defers to the Department of Health and Human Services'\n(HHS's) Office of National Security because the question being asked\nfalls under their purview.\nQuestion. What additional changes would improve the integrity of\nthe grant system and taxpayer funded research? For example, should any\nchanges be made to government grant forms?\nAnswer. OIG conducts oversight of NIH through audits and\nevaluations, some of which relate to protecting the integrity of NIH-\nfunded research. In fiscal year 2019, OIG received $5 million in\nappropriations for oversight of grant programs and operations of NIH,\nincluding NIH efforts to ensure the integrity of its grant application\nevaluation and selection processes. We have evaluations underway to\nassess NIH's vetting and oversight of its peer reviewers, including its\nefforts to prevent or identify inappropriate disclosure of information\nby peer reviewers, and an evaluation of how NIH monitors the financial\nconflicts of interest (including foreign financial interests) reported\nby grantee institutions. In addition, we are examining NIH's adherence\nto its policies for evaluating and selecting grant applications.\nOIG is also initiating audits that will assess NIH's Institutes and\nCenters to review their (1) pre-award process for assessing risk of\npotential recipients of Federal funds; (2) policies, procedures, and\ncontrols in place for ensuring that both foreign and domestic grantees\ndisclose all relevant affiliations, sources of support, and financial\ninterests, including intellectual property interests; (3) internal\ncontrols for identifying and addressing potentially duplicative grant\nfunding and overlap; (4) testing of select cybersecurity controls\nwithin the NIH Electronic Health Records system; and (5) controls to\nensure that NIH has an accurate inventory of hardware, software, and\nInternet protocol resources.\nOIG would be happy to brief you on this body of work as these\nreports are completed.\nIn February 2019, OIG released a report, Opportunities Exist for\nthe National Institutes of Health to Strengthen Controls in Place to\nPermit and Monitor Access to Its Sensitive Data. Several of our\nrecommendations address improvements that NIH could make to bolster the\nintegrity of taxpayer-funded research.\nRegarding government grant forms, we would encourage NIH to require\nprincipal investigators and project directors to sign forms with\nattestations and to require information about ``other income'' from\nthese individuals at an appropriate point in the process. OIG would be\nhappy to consult with NIH or provide further technical assistance to\nCongress on this issue.\nQuestion. What foreign governments pose the greatest threats to\nintellectual property created by taxpayer-funded research at American\nuniversities? How are they working to exploit our academic institutions\nto steal critical IP? Can you share any specific examples of that\nexploitation?\nAnswer. HHS-OIG defers to the Federal Bureau of Investigations'\n(FBI's) Counterintelligence Division, because the question being asked\nis one that falls within the scope of their jurisdiction.\nQuestion. Have foreign nationals, acting surreptitiously on behalf\nof foreign governments, penetrated critical U.S. industries, including\nbut not limited to health-care and pharmaceutical research,\ninfrastructure, financial services, defense, robotics and advanced chip\nprocessing? If yes, please explain what changes, including legislative\nchanges, are needed to stop or slow these incursions.\nAnswer. HHS-OIG defers to HHS's Office of National Security and to\nFBI's Counterintelligence Division, because the question being asked\nfalls under their purview.\n______\nQuestions Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden\nQuestion. How Prevalent Is the Problem: In a January 31, 2019\nletter to Chairman Grassley, HHS Inspector General Daniel Levinson\nresponded to several questions the chairman raised about foreign\nthreats to taxpayer funded medical research. Among the IG's responses:\nin the past 5 years, OIG conducted one investigation of failure to\ndisclose foreign government funding and did not conduct any\ninvestigations involving researchers who were allegedly foreign\ngovernment agents; in the past 5 years, OIG conducted one investigation\nof alleged theft of intellectual property created by taxpayer-funded\nresearch; and in the past 5 years, OIG made two referrals for possible\nprosecution for failure to disclose receipt of foreign government\nfunding.\nIn your testimony, you say that OIG is now investigating 16\nallegations of non-compliance by grantees. Has there been a dramatic\nincrease in the number of violations of these types of activities since\nthe IG wrote his response to Chairman Grassley on January 31st? If not,\ndoes the OIG have reason to believe that these types of activities are\nmuch more widespread than the handful of these incidents that were\nreported to Chairman Grassley in the IG's letter? If so, what are the\nreasons for this increase?\nAnswer. In our January 31st letter to Chairman Grassley, we\nexplained that we had recently received 12 referrals from NIH that\nprimarily involve principal investigators on NIH grants conducting\nmedical research at U.S. universities who allegedly have failed to\ndisclose foreign affiliations on their grant applications. Since that\ntime, we have received another 4 such referrals from NIH, bringing the\ntotal to 16 allegations, which OIG is now investigating. Over the past\n6 months, we have seen a very small increase in OIG hotline complaints\nreceived primarily involving allegations of principal investigators on\nNIH grants conducting medical research at U.S. universities who\nallegedly have failed to disclose foreign affiliations on their grant\napplications. We attribute this very small increase to both NIH's\nramped-up efforts to address such allegations over the past year as\nwell as greater awareness of the issue among other stakeholders due to\nboth increasing and widespread media reports and the Senate Finance\nCommittee's oversight efforts.\nQuestion. Policy on Mixed Government and Non-Government Witnesses\non Panels: Your agency told the Finance Committee that its witness\nwould not participate on a panel at this hearing that included both\ngovernment and non-government witnesses, claiming there is a\nlongstanding OMB policy prohibiting this. However, there are numerous\nexamples where your agency has allowed witnesses to testify on ``mixed\npanels.'' Over the past 10 years, Federal Government witnesses,\nincluding those from your agency, have testified before the Finance\nCommittee on panels with non-government witnesses more than 40 times.\nThis has also been the case with other Senate committees. In April\n2019, an NIH witness testified on a panel with non-government witnesses\nbefore the Senate Aging Committee. An NIH witness also testified on a\npanel with non-government witnesses before this same committee in July\n2017. In March 2018, the Secretary of DHS herself testified on a panel\nwith non-government witnesses before the Senate Select Committee on\nIntelligence. Why were these witnesses permitted to testify before\nother Senate Committees on mixed panels, but your witness was not\npermitted to do so at the Finance Committee's June 5th hearing? If\nwaivers were granted for witnesses to testify on mixed panels at other\ncommittee hearings, why were those waivers granted for the other\nhearings but not the June 5th hearing? Please provide copies of (1) the\nOMB policy that allegedly prevents government witnesses from testifying\non panels with non-government witnesses; (2) any waivers granted for\nthe recent Aging and Intelligence hearings where government witnesses\nfrom NIH and DHS respectively testified with non-government witnesses;\nand (3) any request submitted to OMB for your witness to testify at the\nJune 5th hearing and the OMB response along with an explanation why a\nwaiver was not granted for the June 5th Finance Committee hearing?\nAnswer. This discussion was between HHS's Office of the Assistant\nSecretary for Legislation and the committee. Therefore, HHS-OIG defers\nto the Department.\nQuestion. Source of Foreign Threats: During the hearing, Senator\nWyden asked Dr. Tabak and the first panel of government witnesses to\nidentify the general number, or a range, of countries that currently\nconstituted the source of the foreign threat. Dr. Tabak responded that\nhe could not do so in an unclassified setting and would do so in the\nclassified briefing. Would you please provide a separate, classified\nresponse that identifies the specific countries that you believe\ncurrently present a threat to U.S. research and describe the nature of\nthat threat?\nAnswer. HHS-OIG defers to HHS's Office of National Security and\nFBI's Counterintelligence Division, because the question being asked\nfalls under their purview.\n______\nQuestion Submitted by Hon. John Thune\nQuestion. Mr. Hollie, as you know, the HHS Office of Inspector\nGeneral recently released a report stating that NIH did not concur with\nthe inspector general's recommendation to develop a security framework,\nconduct a risk assessment, and implement additional controls for\nsensitive data in the context of NIH Genomic Data. In your view, why\ndid NIH not concur with this recommendation? In your view, does NIH\nhave valid reasons for rejecting your office's recommendation?\nAnswer. NIH's written response to our report indicated that they\nbelieved additional internal controls were not necessary based on our\nfindings. We explained to NIH that, consistent with Federal\nregulations, NIH should document its acceptance of the risks we\npresented. Further, the NIH Advisory Committee to the Director, issued\na report, ACD Working Group for Foreign Influences on Research\nIntegrity (December 2018). This report identifies similar risk and\nincludes recommendations that are consistent with our recommended\nactions. We are hopeful that NIH will adopt its internal Working Group\nrecommendations, which will likely address the findings in our report.\nWe are still waiting for the OIG Clearance Document response from NIH.\nThat document will provide any action that NIH has taken to address the\nrecommendations in the report and provide the basis for OIG to\ndetermine whether a recommendation is close or is unimplemented.\n______\nQuestion Submitted by Hon. Todd Young\nfive eyes intelligence alliance\nQuestion. The Five Eyes is widely regarded as the world's most\nsignificant intelligence alliance. The origins of it can be traced back\nto the context of the Second World War and by its necessity of sharing\nvital information mainly between Britain and the United States so both\ncountries could enhance the allied war effort. ``Five Eyes'' was\nformally founded in the aftermath of the Second World War, through the\nmultilateral agreement, known as the UKUSA Agreement, on 5 March 1946.\nInitially, compromising only the UK and the United States, it\nexpanded to also include Canada in 1948 and Australia and New Zealand\nin 1956. Thereby, the ``Five Eyes'' term was created from the lengthy\n``Australia/Canada/New Zealand/United Kingdom/United States Eyes Only''\nclassification level that included the ``eyes'' that could have access\nto high-profile papers and information. For more than 70 years this\nalliance of like-minded allies has served our intelligence community\nwell.\nJust like sharing access to sensitive intelligence information,\nshould we think similarly about opening up certain programs or research\nareas to certain students or professors depending on their home\ncountry?\nIs there a model here for academia that is worth following?\nShould we be limiting what countries we conduct sensitive research\nand development with?\nAnswer. HHS-OIG defers to HHS's Office of National Security, NIH,\nand FBI's Counterintelligence Division, because the questions being\nasked all fall within the scope of their respective jurisdictions and\nare beyond the purview of HHS-OIG.\n______\nPrepared Statement of Louis A. Rodi III, Deputy Assistant Director,\nNational Security Investigations Division, Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement, Department of Homeland Security\nintroduction\nChairman Grassley, Ranking Member Wyden, and distinguished members\nof the committee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss the role\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security\nInvestigations (HSI) plays in addressing foreign threats to taxpayer-\nfunded research. The threat posed by nation-states illegally and/or\nsubversively seeking to exploit legitimate educational and research\nopportunities in the United States is evolving. ICE HSI plays a pivotal\nrole in identifying the avenues, methods, and strategies that foreign\nnationals use to attack our research institutions. State actors\nroutinely engage in or facilitate the procurement of U.S. technology\nand theft of intellectual property, sometimes in violation of Federal\nlaws and regulations. Combatting these activities is at the forefront\nof HSI's priorities, with multiple divisions and mission sets within\nthe agency collaborating to identify and uncover foreign actors and\nnetworks exploiting U.S. academic and research institutions and to\nstrategically disrupt their operations.\nHSI is the principal investigative arm of the U.S. Department of\nHomeland Security, responsible for investigating a wide range of\ndomestic and international activities arising from the illegal movement\nof people and goods into, within, and out of the United States. As part\nof its mission, HSI oversees a diverse portfolio of investigative and\nadministrative programs that safeguard the United States against\nnational security and public safety threats, and against the violation\nof customs and immigration laws of the United States. As part of\ntoday's testimony, I would like to highlight some of the initiatives\nHSI has implemented and is seeking to further enhance.\ncurrent state of play/nature of the threat\nThe United States is home to thousands of universities and\ncolleges, many of which are among the most advanced institutions in the\nworld for higher education and scientific, technological, and medical\nresearch. As a result, each year thousands of foreign nationals seek to\nobtain nonimmigrant visas to enable them to travel to the United States\nto pursue educational degrees or research at these institutions.\nThousands more are already present in the United States attending U.S.\ncolleges and universities or conducting advanced research in a\nmultitude of fields.\nAs of May 2019, there are just over 1.13 million nonimmigrant\nstudents present in the United States. This includes 1,129,816 active\nF-1 students and 9,755 active M-1 students. There are 558,784 F-1\nstudents who are studying or engaged in research in science,\ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-related fields.\nWhile openness and international collaboration in academia and\nresearch are important aspects of facilitating significant enhancements\nin science and technology, they also can create an environment that\nU.S. adversaries exploit as a means to gain access to sensitive\ntechnology and information, some of which is controlled for export, and\ntransferred to foreign entities. The largest number of ongoing HSI\nCounter Proliferation Investigations (CPI) cases on controlled exports,\nincluding intangible exports (i.e., the transmission of technical data\nfrom the United States, or transfer to foreign nationals within the\nUnited States) involves China, Iran, and Russia. From these\ninvestigations and based on trend analysis, HSI knows that these\ncountries are actively implementing a multitude of schemes to illicitly\nor subversively acquire and transfer export-controlled military and\ndual use technology and commodities, and are employing myriad schemes\nto circumvent U.S. export control laws.\nExploitation of academia and U.S. research institutions is just one\nof the schemes these countries are employing to obtain access to\nsensitive research and export-\ncontrolled information and technology, and to facilitate its transfer\nabroad. These countries are attempting to obtain this information, in\nmany instances in an illegal or subversive manner, in order to advance\ntheir own military capabilities or economic goals, many times in\ncontravention to the national security of the United States.\nForeign nationals from China, Iran, and Russia represent a sizeable\nportion of the overall nonimmigrant student population currently in the\nUnited States. As of May 2019, there are 357,863 F-1 Chinese students\nin the United States with 181,980 such students enrolled in STEM-\nrelated academic programs at U.S. institutions. There are also 11,323\nF-1 Iranian students and 6,196 F-1 Russian students, with the\nrespective STEM student breakdown of 9,057 for Iran and 2,008 for\nRussia.\nhsi efforts to identify and mitigate the threat\nHSI has established a multi-dimensional approach to safeguarding\nthe homeland against transnational threats of this nature. HSI's first\nline of effort is preventative, and aims to identify and disrupt the\nability of known or suspected national security or public safety\nthreats from obtaining nonimmigrant visas to lawfully travel to, and\nobtain entry into, the United States. A core component of this effort\nis the HSI-led Visa Security Program (VSP). Through the VSP, HSI\nanalysts and special agents work in conjunction with U.S. interagency\nand foreign government partners to maximize the opportunity to screen,\nvet, and investigate potential threats prior to the U.S. Department of\nState (DOS) making a visa determination and well before the applicant\npresents for admission to the United States. This includes those\napplying for student or exchange visitor visas. If sufficient\nderogatory information is uncovered relating to the intentions of visa\napplicants, HSI--working in conjunction with DOS--can recommend\nrefusing visas on a number of grounds, including for suspected\ninvolvement in the illicit procurement or attempted procurement of\ncontrolled technology.\nIn addition to these preventative measures, HSI also implements\nmultiple programs to identify and protect against foreign entities\nalready in the United States who may seek to exploit legitimate\nacademic and research opportunities for the ultimate benefit of\nadversarial state actors. The Student and Exchange Visitor Program\n(SEVP) fulfills a compliance-centric role, and is responsible for\nmonitoring certified educational institutions and the nonimmigrant\nstudents they enroll. The Counterterrorism and Criminal Exploitation\nUnit (CTCEU) coordinates investigative and enforcement actions in cases\nin which nonimmigrant visa holders, including students and exchange\nvisitors, overstay their visas or violate the terms of their visas and\nare suspected of posing a concern to U.S. national security or public\nsafety. If students or exchange visitors appear to be involved in\nefforts to acquire and transfer sensitive information or technology\nobtained during the course of their research or academic pursuits,\nHSI's CPI plays a role in coordinating an investigative and enforcement\nresponse to those activities.\nTogether, these programs form the backbone of HSI's efforts to\nidentify and mitigate the threats posed by foreign entities seeking to\nexploit legitimate academic and research opportunities within the\nUnited States. Each of these programs is described in more detail\nbelow.\nHSI Visa Security Program:\nThe HSI VSP leverages resources in the United States and abroad to\nscreen and vet non-immigrant visa applicants, identify and prevent the\ntravel of those who constitute potential national security or public\nsafety concerns, and launch investigations into transnational criminal-\nand terrorist-affiliated networks operating around the globe. The VSP\nwas formed in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks, authorized by\nsection 428 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and implemented by a\n2003 Memorandum of Understanding between the Secretaries of State and\nHomeland Security.\nCurrently, HSI VSP operations are conducted at 36 visa-issuing\nposts in 27 countries. In FY 2018, VSP screened 2,196,708 visa\napplications, made 1,251 nominations or enhancements to the terrorist\nwatchlist, and recommended the refusal of 9,007 visa applications.\nAdditionally, deployed special agents conducted 5,101 interviews and\ninitiated 348 investigations in support of VSP operations. One key\nfacet of VSP operations is the overseas assignment of HSI Special\nAgents to diplomatic posts worldwide. Embedded within American\nEmbassies and Consulates, these agents work alongside DOS Consular\nAffairs personnel, other partner agencies at post, and appropriate host\ncountry officials to identify and investigate terrorists, criminals, or\nother individuals who pose a threat to the United States.\nA second critical component to VSP is the Pre-Adjudicated Threat\nRecognition Intelligence Operations Team (PATRIOT), administered by HSI\nInternational Operations (IO) in collaboration with U.S. Customs and\nBorder Protection (CBP), which conducts centralized screening and\nvetting in the National Capital Region (NCR) in support of VSP\noperations. PATRIOT enables the automated screening of visa application\ninformation against DHS holdings, as well as holdings of other U.S.\nagencies, at the earliest point in the visa process, well in advance of\nthe visa applicant's interview and visa adjudication. Derogatory\ninformation discovered during automated screening process is manually\nvetted by PATRIOT personnel utilizing law enforcement techniques, open\nsource information, and classified systems. PATRIOT analysts then\nprovide HSI Special Agents assigned to VSP posts with relevant\ninformation to use during interviews of visa applicants or other\ninvestigative activities conducted abroad prior to visa adjudication.\nFollowing the analysis of all known derogatory information, HSI Special\nAgents at VSP posts provide a unified DHS recommendation to DOS on visa\neligibility.\nIn addition to the PATRIOT process, VSP personnel also participate\nin other U.S. government screening and vetting efforts focused on\nprotecting the homeland from diverse national security and public\nsafety threats. Generally, these processes entail collaboration between\nHSI, DOS, and other partner agencies involved in screening and vetting.\nThis includes conducting intensive reviews of visa applications from\nvisa-issuing posts worldwide that are considered high risk for the\napplicant's potential involvement in the unlawful procurement,\ntransfer, or export of sensitive military or dual-use U.S. information\nand technology. At times, these applications may involve individuals\nseeking to exploit the U.S. educational system by enrolling in graduate\nlevel studies or engaging in research, teaching, or exchange programs\nas a way to acquire and transfer sensitive, export-controlled\ntechnology or information on behalf of adversaries or organizations\nthat pose a national security risk to the United States. In some\ninstances, a more intensive screening and vetting of a visa application\nis prompted by risk factors indicative of a visa applicant's potential\ninvolvement in activities related to the unlawful procurement,\ntransfer, or export of sensitive U.S.-origin military or dual-use goods\nor technology on behalf of foreign adversaries or criminal\norganizations. After such reviews, VSP personnel then provide consular\nofficers advice and background information to properly adjudicate\nimmigrant and nonimmigrant visa applications of security or foreign\npolicy interest.\nWhether through the PATRIOT process or other screening and vetting\nefforts in which the VSP is engaged, the VSP ultimately provides\nrecommendations for visa issuance or refusal to DOS based on\ninformation uncovered during the review, vetting, and investigative\nprocess. In all cases where the VSP team recommends the refusal of a\nvisa, the VSP coordinates in advance with CBP's National Targeting\nCenter-Passenger (NTC-P) regarding the applicant's admissibility or\ninadmissibility, per the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). This\nensures that DHS presents a single, uniform position on visa\neligibility and admissibility to DOS.\nThe combination of the international and domestic dimensions of VSP\nequips HSI with a unique capability to investigate suspicious\ntravelers, enhance existing information, and identify previously\nunknown threats, rather than simply denying visas and potential travel\nof these applicants. These efforts allow VSP to operate as a\ncounterterrorism tool that mitigates threats posed by transnational\nterrorist and criminal networks. Utilizing information obtained through\nthe visa application process, the VSP enhances the national security\nand border security of the United States by identifying national\nsecurity or public safety concerns at the earliest part of the visa\nlifecycle and preventing their travel to and admission into the United\nStates.\nHSI Student and Exchange Visitor Program:\nForeign nationals who receive nonimmigrant visas to pursue\neducational, vocational, or research programs in the United States will\ninteract with the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). As of\nMay 2019, there are 1,139,571 nonimmigrant students attending 6,410\nSEVP-certified schools.\nSEVP uses the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System\n(SEVIS) to monitor F and M students and the schools that enroll them\nwhile in the United States. SEVIS also contains the information for the\nExchange Visitor program (J-visas), which is administered by DOS. SEVIS\ncontains information such as a student's name, physical and mailing\naddresses, date of birth, phone number, email address, academic major,\nand employment information (if applicable). SEVIS information is\nupdated by Designated School Officials (DSOs), but the system will\nauto-terminate a student's record if the student fails to enroll or\nreport to school, meaning the student must depart the United States or\nhe or she may be put into removal proceedings.\nSEVP is also responsible for the school certification process. The\ncertification process is rigorous and continual. To obtain initial\ncertification, schools must submit required evidence and applications,\nundergo site visits, and recommend DSOs. These school officials must be\nU.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents and must affirm their\nknowledge and intent to comply with all Federal regulations. The\nschools are furthermore subject to biennial recertification,\nunannounced site visits and out-of-cycle reviews at any time. Schools\nthat do not comply with the regulations may be withdrawn and,\nsubsequently, ineligible to enroll nonimmigrant students until\nsuccessfully re-petitioning for approval and meeting all certification\nstandards.\nBeyond the certification process, SEVP uses SEVIS data to engage in\nrisk management and has enhanced its risk management framework by\ndeveloping a compliance dashboard to identify schools with risk\nindicators. SEVP employs this risk analysis tool to identify schools\nthat may have violated SEVP regulations when conducting recertification\nreviews, adjudicating school updates, and determining whether to\ninitiate out-of-cycle reviews. SEVP regularly conducts compliance site\nvisits to schools to ensure that approved programs are functioning as\nreported in SEVIS. In addition, SEVP continuously vets leads reported\nby the public concerning both schools and students, acting decisively\nto protect public safety and the integrity of the immigration system.\nWhile many of SEVP's processes and programs have proven to be\neffective, HSI strives to improve and enhance these programs. For\nexample, SEVP has mitigated previously identified national security\ngaps and system vulnerabilities within SEVIS and is using an adaptive\nmaintenance approach to continuously add enhancements to the system.\nThese enhancements have improved data integrity and the stability of\nthe system. SEVP is currently working towards transforming SEVIS into a\nperson-centric database. In March 2018, SEVP launched the SEVP Portal\nfor students participating in Optional Practical Training (OPT) related\nto STEM degrees. The Portal allows nonimmigrant students to directly\nupload their required SEVIS information, including their employer's\nname and address, as well as other key information for monitoring\npurposes. The portal interfaces with SEVIS and shares information but\ndoes not give students direct access to SEVIS. The Portal has been a\nsuccess with more than 166,402 registered portal users (i.e., 74.7\npercent of the students eligible for Portal Accounts). The portal will\nbe expanded to all F and M students, resulting in SEVIS data that is\nmore accurate, captures changes in a student's information quicker and\nensures students are accountable for the data inputted.\nAdditionally, SEVP started conducting criminal background checks on\nproposed DSOs in May 2017, due to the fact that these individuals have\naccess to a secure government database and a role in reporting\ninformation in that database. HSI is actively working to expand this\nprocess and incorporate such vetting as part of its regular review of\napproved schools and DSOs, both to safeguard against potential\nvulnerabilities and to ensure the integrity of the information in\nSEVIS. SEVP's current programs, ongoing enhancements, and proposed\nexpansion will further secure our Nation from those wishing to exploit\nthe Nation's education system. For more information about the privacy\nrisks that HSI takes on while operating SEVP and the subsequent\nmitigations, please view the SEVIS privacy impact assessment (PIA) and\nsubsequent updates available at mitigations, please view the SEVIS\nprivacy impact assessment (PIA) and subsequent updates available at\nmitigations, please view the SEVIS privacy impact assessment (PIA) and\nsubsequent updates available at\nHSI Counterterrorism and Criminal Exploitation Unit:\nHSI's CTCEU actively identifies and initiates enforcement action on\nnonimmigrant visa overstay violators, and works closely with SEVP and\nCPI to ensure leads and other information related to potential status\nviolators are referred to HSI field offices for appropriate action.\nWithin the agency, CTCEU focuses on overstay violators who pose a\nnational security, border security, or public safety concern. This\nincludes individuals who entered the United States as nonimmigrant\nstudents or exchange visitors. CTCEU leverages special agents,\nanalysts, information systems, and interagency partnerships to\ndetermine viable national security related overstay leads to pursue.\nIn an average year, CTCEU analyzes over one million potential\nstatus violator records, incorporating data from various government\nsystems, such as SEVIS and CBP's Arrival and Departure Information\nSystem (ADIS). CTCEU conducts both batch and manual vetting against\ngovernment databases, public indices, and open source information. The\nvetting helps determine whether an individual who overstayed has\ndeparted the United States, adjusted to a lawful status, has a pending\nimmigration benefit application, or would be appropriate for an\nenforcement action.\nCTCEU proactively develops cases for investigation, monitors the\nlatest threat reports, and addresses emergent issues. This practice is\ndesigned to detect and identify individuals and schools exhibiting\nspecific risk factors; it is formulated based on intelligence\nreporting, travel patterns, and in-depth criminal research and\nanalysis. It has contributed to the counterterrorism mission by\ninitiating and supporting high-priority national security initiatives,\nbased on specific intelligence. CTCEU considers several fraud\nindicators when reviewing schools, such as a high volume of students\nengaged in OPT or Curriculum Practical Training (CPT), low completion\nrates, over-enrolled schools with student populations exceeding\nindicated I-17 amount, schools receiving Federal funding for sensitive\nresearch, or schools exhibiting various other fraud indicators. CTCEU\nalso reviews SEVP Analysis Operation Center (SAOC) Tip Logs and HSI Tip\nLine information to further enhance or corroborate information received\non schools or school officials.\nLeadTrac is the database owned by CTCEU and is used to vet and\nmanage leads pertaining to visitors in the United States who are\nsuspected of overstaying their period of admission or otherwise\nviolating the terms of their admission, as well as organizations\nsuspected of immigration violations. LeadTrac's structure supports a\nsubject-centered data model, ensuring multiple leads about a single\nsubject are linked within the system. For more information about the\nprivacy risks that HSI CTCEU takes on while operating LeadTrac and the\nsubsequent mitigations, please view the LeadTrac PIA available at\nwww.dhs.gov/privacy.\nIn FY 2018, CTCEU reviewed 1,429,395 leads regarding potential\noverstays. Numerous leads were closed through an automated screening\nprocess, most commonly due to subsequent departure from the United\nStates. A total of 8,968 leads were sent to HSI field offices for\ninvestigation. Of these, 2,212 were pending further investigation,\n2,795 were closed for being in compliance (pending immigration benefit\napplication, granted asylum, approved adjustment of status application,\nor departed the United States) and the remaining leads were returned to\nCTCEU for continuous vetting and further investigation. In FY 2018\nalone, HSI made 1,808 arrests pursuant to visa violator leads. In FY\n2019 through March 31, 2019, CTCEU has reviewed 765,543 leads regarding\npotential overstays and sent 4,940 leads to HSI field offices for\nfurther investigation. HSI has made 1,025 arrests pursuant to visa\nviolator leads in FY 2019.\nCTCEU refers leads that do not meet HSI criteria for further\ninvestigation to ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) National\nCriminal Analysis and Targeting Center (NCATC) which works in close\ncoordination with CTCEU for further vetting. If necessary, the lead is\nforwarded to the respective ERO field office for enforcement action.\nKey Initiatives on Overstay Enforcement\nOutreach is an important component of CTCEU's operations. HSI\nspecial agents have been conducting outreach visits to SEVP-certified\ninstitutions as part of HSI's Project Campus Sentinel (PCS) program.\nThis outreach program, which was established in 2011, aims to build a\nmutual partnership between local HSI special agents and SEVP-certified\ninstitutions by collaboratively preventing the criminal exploitation of\nSEVP through direct and open communication. It furthermore creates an\navenue for improved direct communication between DSOs and local HSI\nspecial agents. In recent years, this outreach program has been\nexpanded to include SEVP field representatives and campus public safety\nentities. This partnership provides all stakeholders the opportunity to\nopenly exchange information, improve cooperation, and bolster the\nsafety and security of students, faculty, and institutions. Since\ninception, HSI special agents have conducted over 4,000 PCS outreaches.\nOther key initiatives in HSI's overstay enforcement efforts include\nthe Domestic Mantis and Visa Lifecycle programs. The Domestic Mantis\nand Visa Lifecycle programs help identify nonimmigrant students who\nhave access to sensitive technology, better capture the overarching\nvisa lifecycle, provide another layer of security for the Nation, and\nserve as innovative investigative tools to support the enforcement of\nU.S. immigration laws.\nCTCEU developed the Domestic Mantis Program in response to a\nGovernment Accountability Office (GAO) assessment that identified a\npotential vulnerability with nonimmigrant students who enter the United\nStates to study in a non-sensitive field of study and subsequently\ntransfer to a sensitive field of study. These individuals could pose a\nsubstantial risk related to the diversion of sensitive technology,\nmaterials, or information.\nThe Domestic Mantis Program aims to enhance national security by\npreventing the export of goods, technology, or sensitive information\nthrough activities such as graduate-level studies, teaching, research,\ntraining, or employment. The program works by identifying students that\nhave changed their field of study to a sensitive area and evaluates\nthose individuals against risk-based targeting criteria. To accomplish\nthis, CTCEU manually extracts and reviews SEVIS data pertaining to\nstudents from countries that have an elevated risk of proliferation\nactivity. The potential leads are analyzed using a comprehensive\nvetting process, including a review against intelligence community\nholdings for additional derogatory information, open source\ninformation, and academic journals. These Domestic Mantis checks are\nperformed twice a year to identify new students who enroll at varying\ntimes within the school year.\nVisa Lifecycle Program\nThe Visa Lifecycle Program tracks nonimmigrant visitors from the\ntime they file visa applications to the time they depart from the\nUnited States, become overstays, or otherwise fail to comply with their\nterms of admission (i.e., become ``out-of-\nstatus''). This program allows HSI to continuously vet and identify\nderogatory information on nonimmigrant visitors for the validity of the\nvisa. In instances where violators are identified, appropriate\nenforcement actions are initiated.\nThe Visa Lifecycle Program focuses on nonimmigrants seeking\nbusiness/tourist (i.e., B1/B2) or student/exchange (i.e., F, J, and M)\nvisas from five DOS visa issuing posts. These posts were selected to\ncomplement existing HSI screening efforts in response to recent global\nacts of terrorism perpetrated in those countries. Working in\ncoordination with HSI's VSP, CTCEU receives information on these visa\napplicants pulled from PATRIOT and the DOS Consular Consolidated\nDatabase (CCD). CTCEU ingests this data into its lead management system\nand continuously vets these nonimmigrant visa holders using an\nautomated open source vetting platform in conjunction with intelligence\ncommunity holdings.\nHSI Counter Proliferation Investigations Program:\nCases involving the attempted acquisition and transfer of\nsensitive, export-\ncontrolled commodities, technology, or information fall within the\npurview of the HSI CPI program. HSI is designated as the primary law\nenforcement agency for investigating violations of U.S. export laws\nrelated to military items, controlled dual-use goods, and sanctioned/\nembargoed countries. HSI, through its CPI program, has statutory\nauthority to investigate violations of U.S. export control laws , and\nis uniquely equipped--as the only agency enforce with border search\nauthority, undercover authority, forfeiture authority, and an extensive\ninternational footprint--to combat the trafficking of weapons and\ntechnology, to include chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear\nmaterials, and other items required to produce weapons of mass\ndestruction (WMD).\nHSI's CPI mission is directly aligned with U.S. national security\nand defense strategies, as they pertain to protecting the American war\nfighter and the homeland from having sensitive U.S.-origin military and\nWMD technology fall into the hands of U.S. adversaries; securing the\nU.S. border from firearms being smuggled to transnational criminal\norganizations; disrupting the supply chains of illicit procurement\nnetworks by preventing terrorist groups and hostile nations from\nacquiring U.S. military hardware, firearms, sensitive technical data,\ndual-use technology, and materials used to develop weapons of mass\ndestruction; protecting U.S. industry from sensitive intangible\ntechnology transfers; and keeping U.S. industry's intellectual\nproperty, as well as ground breaking research and development, from\nbeing exploited by U.S. adversaries.\nHSI, and its predecessor agency, the U.S. Customs Service, has been\nexercising its export enforcement authority for over 100 years.\nAlthough other Federal law enforcement, regulatory, intelligence, and\nmilitary agencies are involved in the overall U.S. export control\nefforts, HSI is empowered with full statutory authority to investigate\nviolations of all U.S. export control laws, such as the Arms Export\nControl Act (AECA) and International Traffic in Arms Regulations\n(ITAR); the Export Controls Act of 2018 (ECRA) and the Export\nAdministration Regulations (EAR); the International Emergency Economic\nPowers Act (IEEPA); and Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA). From 2012 to\n2018, HSI CPI investigations have resulted in over 17,000 cases\ninitiated, 4,006 arrests, and 8,288 seizures.\nU.S. export control laws are comprehensive and include restrictions\non tangible exports (i.e., the actual shipment of items from the U.S.),\nintangible exports (i.e., the transmission of technical data from the\nUnited States, or transfer to foreign nationals within the United\nStates), re-exports and transshipments (i.e., exports from one foreign\ncountry to another), and controls on services and other business\nactivities (i.e., training, brokering, and financing services). Because\nof the complexity of U.S. export control laws and the multiple\nlicensing agencies involved, HSI CPI special agents conduct outreach\nvisits and provide presentations to private industry and academic\ninstitutions. This program, known as Project Shield America (PSA), is\ndesigned to increase public awareness of export control laws and\nregulations, and to equip private industry and the academic community\nwith the knowledge needed to aid in recognition, detection, and\nresolution of attempted illegal acquisitions of sensitive, export-\ncontrolled goods and technology. Since 2001, HSI special agents have\nconducted more than 32,000 PSA outreach presentations, resulting in\nsuccessful HSI criminal investigations worldwide.\nCurrently, the United States is facing an unprecedented threat from\nforeign governments, such as Iran, China, and Russia, who have launched\nfar-reaching campaigns to illicitly acquire sensitive, and in some\ncases export-controlled, commodities, technology, research, and/or\ninformation needed to further their strategic military and economic\ngoals. One area targeted by these state actors is academia. These\nadversarial nations take advantage of academic openness in the name of\n``fundamental research'' to target U.S. institutions of higher learning\nto capture U.S. technology, processes, and other intellectual property.\nThis process is generally labeled non-traditional collection. In the\ncontext of academia, this entails foreign adversaries facilitating or\nsupporting academic research and expertise development in sensitive\nfields by student and exchange visitor nonimmigrant visa holders.\nThrough this process, these students and researchers acquire, export,\nor transfer information or technology to foreign entities in a\nsubversive manner and without licenses, if the information or\ntechnology is export controlled. These activities pose a threat to U.S.\nnational security and compromise the integrity of the U.S. academic and\nresearch system.\nTo mitigate this threat, HSI has recently taken proactive steps to\nincrease outreach to export control officers and other officials within\nthe academic community, particularly at universities or research\ninstitutions with large foreign student populations enrolled in STEM-\nrelated programs. These outreach efforts are conducted in conjunction\nwith SEVP and CTCEU representatives. The goal of this increased focus\non academia outreach is to raise awareness of the potential\nproliferation risk posed by students and researchers seeking to acquire\nand transfer sensitive research, technology, and/or intellectual\nproperty (some of which may be export controlled) on behalf of foreign\ngovernments or sanctioned entities. This initiative also aims to\nenhance the capacity of academic institutions to recognize potential\ninstances of potential illicit procurement, intellectual property\ntheft, or other possible violations of U.S. laws, and to provide a\nconduit to report any suspicious activities detected by universities or\nresearch institutes.\nWhile raising awareness within the U.S. academic sector and the\nprivate sector is an important step, HSI is also making a concerted\neffort to prevent the acquisition and transfer of technology by foreign\nnationals through non-traditional collection means. To that end, HSI\nhas initiated efforts to combine and coordinate resources and\ninformation available to CPI, CTCEU, SEVP, and VSP in a joint effort to\nidentify, investigate, and prevent destination-controlled technology\nand export-controlled technology transfers out of the United States\nthat violate U.S. laws and/or weaken the U.S. technological advantage\nin key fields. This effort will focus on the role foreign students,\nprimarily from sensitive countries, studying at U.S. universities and\ncolleges play in these activities, and will aim to utilize the full\nbreadth of HSI's administrative and criminal authorities to combat the\nthreat posed by these foreign actors.\nHSI is committed to free and open academic environment, but this\nmust be balanced against national security measures; if not, these\ninstitutions will be taken advantage of and critical U.S. technology\nand research can be acquired easily by adversaries.\nconclusion\nIn closing, mindful of the United States' historical role in the\ndevelopment of critical technology in coordination with foreign\npartners and U.S. academic institutions, HSI remains committed to\nmaintaining a free and open academic environment within the United\nStates; however, this must be balanced with an appropriate focus on\nnational security and public safety. The threat posed by adversarial\nnation-states illegally and subversively seeking to exploit legitimate\neducational and research opportunities in the United States, many of\nwhich are funded with U.S. taxpayer dollars, is real, and the United\nStates must continue to pursue all appropriate means to combat it.\nHSI will continue to work with academia, law enforcement partners,\nand other agency partners, to use its extensive administrative and\ncriminal authorities to identify and disrupt the activities of\nindividuals or organizations who seek to harm the United States in this\narena and the multitude of others in which HSI is engaged. HSI is well\npositioned to mitigate this threat through the many programs\nhighlighted today, all of which provide a multi-layered level of\nsecurity aimed at protecting the homeland from illicit transnational\nactivities of its adversaries. From the preventative angle of the VSP,\nto the compliance focus of SEVP, and through the investigative and\nenforcement programs executed by the CTCEU and CPI programs, HSI is and\nwill continue to be engaged in countering this critical problem.\nEnhancements and expansion of these programs, combined with enhanced\nadministrative and criminal enforcement authorities, will only improve\nHSI's ability to identify and thwart the efforts of foreign actors who\npose national security or public safety concerns to the United States.\nHSI looks forward to continuing to work with the committee regarding\nthese HSI programs.\nThank you again for inviting me today to explain HSI's critical\nrole in protecting the national security and public safety of the\nUnited States. I would be pleased to answer your questions.\n______\nQuestions Submitted for the Record to Louis A. Rodi III\nQuestions Submitted by Hon. Chuck Grassley\nother countries\nQuestion. Since 2008, the Chinese military has sponsored more than\n2,500 Chinese military scientists and engineers to travel to\nuniversities in the U.S. and elsewhere as students or visiting\nscholars. According to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, these\narrangements have empowered China to make significant advances in\ndeveloping military technology by leveraging U.S. and other countries'\nexperience, facilities, and resources in high-tech industries. In fact,\nthe United States has been the number one destination for PLA\nscientists since 2006. Chinese state media proudly refer to this\nstrategy as ``picking flowers in foreign lands to make honey in\nChina.''\nWhat other countries and governments are you concerned about\nexploiting loopholes in our immigration system to further that theft?\nCan you share any specific examples of that exploitation? Please\nindicate which of the responses will be classified.\nAnswer. The three primary countries of concern are China, Iran, and\nRussia. Based on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)\nHomeland Security Investigations (HSI) reporting, students from India\nand South Korea have also exhibited risk factors for exploiting\nloopholes in the U.S. immigration system to further sensitive\ntechnology and intellectual property theft. Other countries\nexperiencing instability and/or threats at home may also be of\nsignificant concern for immigration fraud.\nThe following examples relate to China's policy and direction for\nChinese students to function ``as intelligence collectors'' for the\nbenefit of the Chinese government:\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested a Chinese\nstudent attending the Illinois Institute of Technology for\nproviding information to China's Ministry of State Security\nofficials in Nanjing City regarding U.S. scientists and\nengineers. The Department of Defense and Department of Homeland\nSecurity (DHS) helped identify the student through\ncollaboration on the Military Accessions Vital to National\nInterest program.\nA Chinese student who was studying musicology through a\nsummer exchange program was detained for having wandered onto a\nU.S. Naval Station in Key West, FL and taking photos of antenna\nfields and various military installations.\nOther examples of ICE HSI investigations related to this threat\nwould be Law Enforcement Sensitive or classified, and more\nappropriately briefed in a closed setting.\ncourse changes\nQuestion. Are foreign students entering the U.S. to study something\nthat isn't suspicious, like English literature, then changing their\ncourse of study to an area that is highly sensitive, such as biomedical\nor semiconductor research for nefarious purposes? Do these course\nchanges pose a national security risk, and are these changes often at\nthe direction of foreign governments? If yes, what actions are needed\nto close these loopholes?\nAdditionally, if action is needed to close these loopholes, will\nHSI work with Congress to draft potential legislative fixes? Can we\nclose loopholes and protect national security without limiting our\nability to attract the best and brightest talent from around the world?\nAnswer. There have been instances in which nonimmigrant students\nwho were approved to study non-sensitive fields pursuant to F-1\nnonimmigrant status entered the United States and subsequently\ntransferred into programs of study in sensitive fields. Some foreign\nnationals have also obtained tourist visas and, once in the United\nStates, changed their nonimmigrant status to attend U.S. colleges and\nuniversities without going through the traditional visa-vetting process\napplied to prospective nonimmigrant students seeking to study sensitive\nfields. In 2016, ICE HSI established the Domestic Mantis Program (DM)\nto monitor any national security and public safety risks posed by\nforeign students who transferred into programs to study in sensitive\nfields. ICE HSI had initiated Project Steady Stare (PS2), aimed at\nbuilding on the DM Program and equipping ICE HSI with the capability to\nconduct a targeted intelligence and investigative analysis on those\nforeign students who pose the highest risk for nontraditional\ncollection, unapproved technology transfer, and/or potential criminal\nor administrative violations of law. Since the inception of this\nproject, ICE HSI has partnered with DHS in a Department-wide effort and\nrebranded this initiative as the Stellar Sunrise Project (SSP).\nAs the principal investigative arm of DHS, ICE HSI plays a pivotal\nrole in safeguarding national security and is committed to working with\nCongress to develop potential legislative fixes that enable the United\nStates to maintain a free and open academic environment, balanced with\nan appropriate focus on national security and public safety. In\nresponse to prior questions for the record and requests for\ncongressional technical assistance on this subject, ICE HSI provided\nits assessment of potential legislative action that may be considered\nto help close loopholes that are being exploited in this space.\nIn general, these recommendations entail a combination of:\nEnsuring DHS has full discretionary authority to review and\nrecommend that the Department of State revoke the nonimmigrant\nvisas of students deemed to be high risk for sensitive\ntechnology transfer and strengthening the legal authority and\nability for DHS and the U.S. Department of State to execute\nrevocations;\nIncreased administrative removal authorities for students\nposing a proliferation risk;\nWhen deemed appropriate by DHS, the mandatory re-evaluation\nof the nonimmigrant visa status of foreign students studying in\nthe United States in sensitive fields;\nThe ability to implement nonimmigrant visa debarment for\nviolators; and\nConnected administrative sanctions for non-compliance by\nacademic and research institutions.\nDHS needs express and specific additional law enforcement\nauthorities to address these incursions. ICE HSI needs reinstatement of\nHSI's export subpoena authority for Export Control Reform Act\ninvestigations, which was lost when the Export Administration Act was\nrepealed and replaced. This authority could directly contribute to ICE\nHSI's ability to investigate Export Administration Regulations\ncontrolled research violations.\ncritical industries\nQuestion. Have foreign nationals, acting surreptitiously on behalf\nof foreign governments, penetrated critical U.S. industries, including\nbut not limited to health care and pharmaceutical research,\ninfrastructure, financial services, defense, robotics, and advanced\nchip processing? If yes, please explain what changes are needed to stop\nor slow these incursions.\nAnswer. Foreign nationals are functioning in all the listed areas\nand have access to uncontrolled research, as well as to potentially\ncontrolled research. Controlled research is typically defined by those\nitems or information regulated under the International Traffic in Arms\nRegulations (ITAR) or the Export Administration Regulations (EAR).\nHowever, with the advent and expediency of new or emerging\ntechnologies, there could be items that are not explicitly controlled\nunder ITAR or EAR. The manner in which foreign governments might be\ndirecting their citizens falls into classified channels.\nDHS needs express and specific additional law enforcement\nauthorities to address these incursions. First, ICE HSI needs a\nreinstatement of HSI's export subpoena authority for Export Control\nReform Act investigations, which was lost when the Export\nAdministration Act was repealed and replaced. This authority could\ndirectly contribute to ICE HSI's ability to investigate ITAR and/or EAR\ncontrolled research violations. Second, ICE HSI needs discretionary,\nadministrative removal authority vested to the Secretary of Homeland\nSecurity and delegated to ICE HSI. These new authorities would give ICE\nHSI the ability to administratively remove non-\nimmigrant visa holders who may be involved in the unlawful or\nsurreptitious collection and/or transfer of sensitive technology or\nresearch to foreign governments or their proxies. The visa categories\nmost likely to pose a substantial risk related to the diversion of\nsensitive technology, materials, or information are academic students\n(F-1) and exchange visitors (J-1) but are not limited to these two visa\ncategories.\ndetect and monitor threats\nQuestion. Are we, as a government, doing enough to detect and\nmonitor efforts by foreign nationals to improperly influence or\nappropriate sensitive research funded by U.S. Government grants? If\nnot, what changes are needed to more effectively identify and remove\nthese threats?\nAnswer. As the principal investigative arm of DHS, ICE HSI plays a\npivotal role in safeguarding U.S. national security. With unique and\nwide-ranging criminal and administrative authorities, combined with\naccess to all nonimmigrant foreign student visa information, ICE HSI is\nwell-positioned to detect, monitor, and disrupt efforts by foreign\nnationals to exploit U.S. academic and research institutions.\nLeveraging the existing operations of the ICE HSI Counter-\nProliferation Investigations Program, the Counter-Terrorism and\nCriminal Exploitation Unit, the Student and Exchange Visitors Program,\nand the Visa Security Program, ICE HSI initiated Project Steady Stare\n(PS2), a proactive and holistic agency effort to target and prevent the\npotential illicit procurement and theft of technology and intellectual\nproperty by foreign students, researchers, and professors involved in\nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics programs at U.S.\ncolleges and universities across the Nation. Since the commencement of\nthis project, ICE HSI has partnered with DHS and created an interagency\ntask force that would give analysts access to additional data sets to\nanalyze and help further identify and detect more threats, and would\nstreamline and facilitate coordination among interagency partners to\ntake action against these threats. This initiative is called the\nStellar Sunrise Project (SSP).\nSSP equips ICE HSI with the capability to conduct comprehensive law\nenforcement intelligence and investigative analysis on those foreign\nstudents who raise national security concerns to determine potential\nrisk for nontraditional collection, unapproved technology transfer,\nand/or potential criminal or administrative violations of law.\nSSP builds on ICE HSI's DM, which was established as part of the\n2016 overstay enhancements. DM reviews F-1 visa holders who have\nswitched from a non-\nsensitive field of study to a sensitive field of study and are\npublishing at their U.S. institution on sensitive topics. DM\nconsequently does not review the following populations that may also be\nat a heightened risk of facilitating illicit technology transfer:\nF-1 nonimmigrants who were admitted to the United States to\nstudy sensitive fields of study;\nJ-1 nonimmigrants (research associates and professors),\nincluding visiting researchers studying in the United States\nfor short periods of time; and\nSpouses or other dependents of F and J nonimmigrants who\nchange visa classification to study or research sensitive\nmajors themselves.\nDespite ICE HSI programs and initiatives designed to identify these\nthreats, additional steps could be taken to enhance ICE HSI's ongoing\nefforts. This includes:\nAdditional resources specifically dedicated to this issue,\nwhich would enable ICE HSI to comprehensively vet more foreign\nstudents who pose a nontraditional collection or technology\ntransfer risk.\nHowever, even with additional resources and interagency\ncoordination, ICE HSI and its partners may still be limited in the\naction they are able to take to mitigate foreign student threats,\nparticularly since in many cases the conduct of foreign students may\nnot be illegal. Through prior questions for the record and technical\nassistance provided to Congress on other proposed bills, ICE HSI\nprovided its assessment of potential legislative action that could be\nconsidered to help close loopholes that are being exploited in this\nspace. In general, these recommendations entail a combination of:\nWhen a potential risk is identified, DHS will conduct an\nevaluation of options impacting the nonimmigrant status of\nforeign students studying in sensitive fields of study in the\nUnited States to include visa cancellation and expedited\nremoval from the U.S.;\nIncreased administrative removal authorities related to\nstudents posing a proliferation risk;\nA reinstatement of ICE HSI's export subpoena authority for\nExport Control Reform Act Investigations; and\nConnected administrative sanctions for non-compliance by\nacademic and research institutions.\nQuestions Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden\npanels\nQuestion. Your agency told the Finance Committee that its witness\nwould not participate on a panel at this hearing that included both\ngovernment and non-government witnesses, claiming there is a\nlongstanding OMB policy prohibiting this. However, there are numerous\nexamples where your agency has allowed witnesses to testify on ``mixed\npanels.'' Over the past 10 years, Federal Government witnesses,\nincluding those from your agency, have testified before the Finance\nCommittee on panels with non-government witnesses more than 40 times.\nThis has also been the case with other Senate committees. In April\n2019, an NIH witness testified on a panel with non-government witnesses\nbefore the Senate Aging Committee. An NIH witness also testified on a\npanel with non-government witnesses before this same committee in July\n2017. In March 2018, the Secretary of DHS herself testified on a panel\nwith non-government witnesses before the Senate Select Committee on\nIntelligence. Why were these witnesses permitted to testify before\nother Senate committees on mixed panels but your witness was not\npermitted to do so at the Finance Committee's June 5th hearing? If\nwaivers were granted for witnesses to testify on mixed panels at other\ncommittee hearings, why were those waivers granted for the other\nhearings but not the June 5th hearing? Please provide copies of (1) the\nOMB policy that allegedly prevents government witnesses from testifying\non panels with non-government witnesses; (2) any waivers granted for\nthe recent Aging and Intelligence hearings where government witnesses\nfrom NIH and DHS respectively testified with non-government witnesses;\nand (3) any request submitted to OMB for your witness to testify at the\nJune 5th hearing and the OMB response along with an explanation why a\nwaiver was not granted for the June 5th Finance Committee hearing.\nAnswer. DHS welcomes the opportunity to testify before Congress to\ndiscuss our programs, challenges, and need, and to address any\nquestions the legislative branch may have. Upon receiving an invitation\nto testify, DHS works with the requestor, in most cases the chairman or\nranking member of the committee, to determine the most appropriate\nwitness available to provide the testimony and expertise desired, in\nthe most appropriate environment. Except under extraordinary\ncircumstances, DHS observes the historical practice of not appearing\nwith non-federal witnesses on a single panel. In almost all cases, the\nappropriate environment to receive DHS testimony is on a government-\nonly panel. While DHS cannot speak for other Departments, agencies, or\nofficials who have chosen to appear on mixed panels before Congress in\nthe past, presently, DHS officials do not testify alongside non-\ngovernmental witnesses.\nIn making its determination, the Department considers whether such\nappearance would: (1) draw the DHS witness into conflicts that may\ncompromise the legal, commercial, or security interests of the United\nStates; (2) introduce subject matter beyond the scope of the hearing or\nexpertise of the witness; and/or (3) undermine the DHS witness's\nability to communicate clearly with the committee.\nsource of foreign threats\nQuestion. During the hearing, I asked Dr. Tabak and the first panel\nof government witnesses to identify the general number, or a range, of\ncountries that currently constituted the source of the foreign threat.\nDr. Tabak responded that he could not do so in an unclassified setting\nand would do so in the classified briefing. Would you please provide a\nseparate, classified response that identifies the specific countries\nthat you believe currently present a threat to U.S. research and\ndescribe the nature of that threat?\nAnswer. For ICE HSI, the largest number of active criminal counter-\nproliferation investigations on controlled exports, including\nintangible exports (i.e., the transmission of technical data from the\nUnited States or transfer to foreign nationals within the United\nStates), involves China, Iran, and Russia. These three countries are\nactively implementing a myriad of schemes to illicitly or subversively\nacquire and transfer export-controlled military and dual-use technology\nand commodities and are employing numerous ways to circumvent U.S.\nexport control laws.\nICE HSI National Security Investigations Division provided a\nclassified briefing on the referenced topic on June 5, 2019.\nQuestions Submitted by Hon. Todd Young\nfive eyes expansion\nQuestion. The Five Eyes is widely regarded as the world's most\nsignificant intelligence alliance. The origins of it can be traced back\nto the context of the Second World War and by its necessity of sharing\nvital information mainly between Britain and the United States so both\ncountries could enhance the allied war effort. ``Five Eyes'' was\nformally founded in the aftermath of the Second World War, through the\nmultilateral agreement known as the UKUSA Agreement, on March 5, 1946.\nInitially, compromising only the UK and the United States, it\nexpanded to also include Canada in 1948 and Australia and New Zealand\nin 1956. Thereby, the ``Five Eyes'' term was created from the lengthy\n``Australia/Canada/New Zealand/United Kingdom/United States Eyes Only''\nclassification level that included the ``eyes'' that could have access\nto high-profile papers and information.\nFor more than 70 years this alliance of like-minded allies has\nserved our intelligence community well.\nJust like sharing access to sensitive intelligence information,\nshould we think similarly about opening up certain programs or research\nareas to certain students or professors depending on their home\ncountry?\nIs there a model here for academia that is worth following?\nShould we be limiting what countries we conduct sensitive research\nand development with?\nAnswer. As many research areas fall under fundamental research, the\ndata is already open to Five Eyes (FVEY) partners and others.\nRestrictions placed on sensitive fields of study are limited and\ngenerally do not impact foreign nationals from FVEY partners. We need\nto strike a delicate, albeit necessary, balance between the open\nacademic environment that is necessary for fundamental research, while\nalso mitigating threats from foreign actors that pose a risk to U.S.\nnational security. This may include placing limitations on which\ncountries we partner with to conduct sensitive research and\ndevelopment.\n______\nPrepared Statement of Captain Michael Schmoyer, Ph.D., Assistant Deputy\nSecretary for National Security; and Director, Office of National\nSecurity, Department of Health and Human Services\nGood morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Wyden, and distinguished\nmembers of the committee. It is an honor to appear before you today to\ndiscuss the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) efforts\nto address foreign threats. My testimony today will focus on the\nthreats foreign governments and foreign agents present to U.S.\nGovernment-funded medical research, the efforts undertaken by HHS to\ndetect the threats and protect the integrity of medical research--an\narea that is critical for our Nation's ability to provide healthcare\nand for biodefense; and the role of HHS's Office of National Security\n(ONS), formerly known as the Office of Security and Strategic\nInformation (OSSI), and its capabilities.\nMy name is Captain Michael Schmoyer, the Assistant Deputy Secretary\nfor National Security and Director of HHS's ONS. ONS is headed by the\nAssistant Deputy Secretary for National Security, who reports directly\nto the Department's Deputy Secretary and also serves as the Secretary's\nSenior Intelligence Official on intelligence and counterintelligence\nissues. ONS's vision is for HHS personnel to successfully accomplish\nmissions worldwide in a security-informed manner and with the\nactionable intelligence needed for operational and policy decisions.\nONS's responsibilities include: integrating intelligence and security\ninformation into HHS policy and operational decisions; assessing,\nanticipating, and warning of potential security threats to HHS and\nnational security in general; and providing policy guidance on and\nmanaging the implementation of the Department's national security,\nintelligence, and counterintelligence programs.\nONS's programs include handling national security clearances for\nemployees, classified national security information management, secure\narea (i.e., Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities) management,\ncommunications security, safeguarding and sharing of classified\ninformation, cyber-threat intelligence, insider threat, and\ncounterintelligence. In coordination with the Director of National\nIntelligence, ONS has been designated since 2012 as the Department's\nFederal Intelligence Coordination Office, and I serve as the\nDepartment's Federal Senior Intelligence Coordinator. ONS has\nresponsibilities to establish implementing guidance, provide oversight,\nand manage the Department's policy for the sharing, safeguarding, and\ncoordinated exchange of information relating to national or homeland\nsecurity with other Federal departments and agencies, including law\nenforcement organizations and the intelligence community, in compliance\nwith the HHS polices and applicable laws, regulations, and Executive\nOrders.\nthe threats foreign governments and foreign agents present\nto taxpayer-funded research\nONS has an important mission that focuses on supporting HHS's\nability to conduct research that will lead to the development of\ntreatments, diagnostics, and vaccines to address public health needs,\nincluding medical countermeasures to address the ever-evolving threat\nof newly emerging and re-emerging infectious disease caused by\npathogens, including those that are select agents and other biological\nthreats to the homeland. While appreciating the value of scientific\nadvancement, HHS has an equal interest in maintaining the integrity of\nthe Department's scientific enterprise. Similarly, HHS embraces the\ncontributions that foreign partnerships have made to expanding\nscientific knowledge that protects, promotes, and advances public\nhealth and medical pursuits worldwide.\nThrough work with our national security partners over the past 2\nyears, ONS became aware of threats to the grant process and\nintellectual property that is a cornerstone of the Department's,\nincluding the National Institutes of Health (NIH), core values and\nbiomedical research integrity. After becoming aware of foreign\nentities' systematic approaches to influence NIH researchers and peer\nreviewers, ONS quickly worked with NIH, the Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the\nNational Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) to identify\nsteps to mitigate these threats to U.S. biomedical research.\nONS is a supporter of NIH's initiative to stand up a working group\nof the Advisory Committee to the NIH Director that addresses ways to\nmitigate risks to intellectual property as well as measures to protect\nthe peer review process. In fact, ONS provided a briefing to the\nDirector's working group on the risks that U.S. Government-funded\npartners face as well as strategies that we are using, together, to\nmitigate those risks.\nthe role of hhs's office of national security and its capabilities to\ndetect threats and protect the integrity of medical research\nAs mentioned previously, a large part of the ONS mission is to\ncounter foreign intelligence entity threats. ONS does this in three\nfundamental ways:\nidentification of foreign intelligence threats and sharing\nof threat information with our agencies (including NIH), the\nFBI, and the broader intelligence community;\nsafeguarding HHS's sensitive information, relationships,\nproperty, and activities; and\nprevention and detection of insider threats.\nI am the designated senior official within the Department who is\nresponsible for countering threats from foreign intelligence entities.\nUtilizing the resources and authorities that we currently have, ONS\nbuilds interdisciplinary partnerships throughout HHS, including NIH, in\na variety of areas that include, but are not limited to, physical\nsecurity, chief information officers, human resources, and acquisition/\nprocurement. We have worked with partners, both internally and\nexternally, to conduct assessments of HHS's sensitive information,\nproperty, and activities; we have found that these periodic risk\nassessments are the cornerstone for all of our corresponding security\nand counter-threat activities.\nWe have also developed measures and strategies that are\ncommensurate with the risk assessment-identified threats to HHS and\nhave specifically focused on elements such as information security\nmeasures, personnel security practices, foreign contact and visitor\nvetting, supply chain risk management, Committee for Foreign Investment\nin the U.S. proposed acquisitions, and prevention of unauthorized\ndisclosures. Specific examples of these measures and strategies\ninclude: (1) implementing long-standing policies relating to\ndistribution of badges, vetting visitors, coordination with the\nintelligence community, and addressing insider threats; (2) regularly\nevaluating the application of adjudication suitability standards\nrelating to onboarding new personnel (civil service, contractors,\ndetailees and fellows); (3) utilizing existing mechanisms to share\nthreat and vulnerability information across the enterprise; (4)\ncontinually promoting workforce awareness of the threat from foreign\nintelligence entities and providing awareness and reporting\ninstructions to HHS personnel; and (5) implementing specific measures\nto detect intrusions.\nthe efforts undertaken by hhs and nih to vet researchers\nONS works closely with the Department of Justice, including the\nFBI; with other HHS components, including the OIG and NIH; and with the\nbroader intelligence community to identify NIH-employed researchers who\nmay have engaged in problematic practices with foreign entities that\nmay have unduly influenced and capitalized on U.S.-conducted research.\nONS has access to a variety of databases that enable us to vet\nemployees, as well as visitors, to HHS facilities (including NIH).\nThese database results are linked with National Security partners to\nensure the results we have are both reliable and valid.\nOur conversations relating to vetting for derogatory information\noccur with the FBI and others (both in and outside of the intelligence\ncommunity) on a daily basis. In addition, we share our results with\nother departments which often have similar missions to HHS. Currently,\nHHS vets new civilian employees, U.S. Public Health Service\nCommissioned Corps officers, contractors, research fellows, interns,\nand foreign national visitors to HHS properties. We have had both\nonboarding-related policies as well as a foreign visitor policy in\nplace since at least 2011; these policies are updated as needed. HHS\ndoes not vet funded research partners who are not employees, or\ncontractors, of HHS (for example, NIH-funded university principal\ninvestigators).\nAdditionally, we have initiated a new focus within ONS that will be\ndedicated to working with universities to empower their programs to,\namong other things, conduct vetting similar to what we do for\nemployees/contractors within HHS. We have been excited to work with\nNIH, FBI, OIG, and NCSC to see this new national security-related\neffort comes to fruition. With this focus we are better able to address\npotential threats of foreign influences on research integrity at the\ngrantee level.\nthe role the fbi plays in assisting hhs and its sub-agencies in\ndetecting and combating foreign threats\nOver the past 2 years, all of the efforts undertaken by ONS to\nprevent, detect, and mitigate threats to the integrity of medical\nresearch have been done in conjunction with national security partners\nacross the government. We have worked especially closely with the FBI,\nincluding instituting a formalized full-time detailing of a Supervisory\nSpecial Agent to our office.\nSince the spring of 2017, ONS became acutely aware of specific\nchallenges relating to the threat of foreign influences on HHS, and\nspecifically NIH, research integrity. We became involved in two whole-\nof-government working groups, led by the FBI, to address the challenges\nsince some foreign governments have initiated systematic programs to\nunduly influence and capitalize on U.S.-conducted research, including\nthat funded by NIH. We became aware that some HHS-funded scientists had\nnot been disclosing foreign grant support, affiliation with\nlaboratories outside of the U.S., or even faculty appointments with\nforeign nations. Additionally, we learned about threats to the NIH\ngrant peer review process where confidentiality was compromised and\ninformation shared that attempted to alter the NIH funding decision\nprocess.\nWhile the relationship with FBI and ONS had existed since the early\n2000s, our work in early 2017 with the FBI surrounding the threats\nposed to the NIH campus and its extramural grant process galvanized our\nrelationship even further. HHS quickly became even more active with the\nBaltimore FBI field office and the Washington field office's\ncounterintelligence programs. Together, in close coordination with our\nOIG, NIH, and NCSC colleagues, we quickly worked on a strategy to\naddress the threat of foreign nontraditional counterintelligence\ncollection. Our main focus was to ensure that our national security-\nrelated efforts continued to support successful relationships with\nforeign scientists in all countries supporting the research enterprise\nwhile simultaneously protecting the Nation's, and HHS's research\nintegrity.\nIn closing, thank you for the opportunity to review the national\nsecurity role and work of the HHS ONS and our efforts to address\nforeign threats in research.\n______\nQuestions Submitted for the Record to Captain Michael Schmoyer, Ph.D.\nQuestions Submitted by Hon. Chuck Grassley\nQuestion. If principal investigators were subject to the same\nbackground check as NIH employees, and were also subject to a review\nfor counterintelligence purposes, how would those checks help\nstrengthen grant integrity?\nAnswer. Standard background checks for new Federal employees\ninvolve a criminal records check, as well as inquiring about the\nprospective employee with their former employers. The average NIH\nemployee is not reviewed for counterintelligence purposes as many do\nnot hold national security clearances.\nReviewing all principal investigators (PIs) (both NIH PIs and\nextramural investigators) for counterintelligence purposes could\nstrengthen grant integrity, but must be pursued as a whole-of-\ngovernment solution as opposed to a fragmentary approach. This is\nlargely due to the sheer number of applications involved in the effort.\nFor example, just handling PIs on NIH grants alone would require the\nability to process over 20,000 applications quarterly. An additional\nconsideration is that the above only covers NIH; it does not include\nother Federal departments and agencies who conduct research.\nONS recently stood up an NIH-focused branch with a team\nspecifically focused on working directly with NIH-funded extramural\nentities to train institutes of higher education staff on how to\nidentify counterintelligence threats. As noted above, if deemed\nappropriate, such approaches could be considered from a whole-of-\ngovernment perspective, rather than remaining solely focused on NIH-\nfunded entities.\nQuestion. If principal investigators were subject to the same\nbackground check as NIH employees, and were also subject to a review\nfor counterintelligence purposes, would those checks improve the\ngovernment's security posture? If so, how? If not, why not?\nAnswer. For the same reasons cited above, while usage of\ncounterintelligence screenings in the grants process would improve the\ngovernment's security posture, performing such checks would increase\nthe administrative burden behind every grant, slowing down important\nresearch.\nQuestion. How many people within the Office of National Security\nwork on vetting foreign visitors and other individuals within your\noffice's purview? Is your staffing sufficient?\nAnswer. The HHS/Division of Operations (DO), within ONS, has one\nindividual designated full time for vetting of foreign visitors to the\nDepartment and several agencies (including NIH). DO has one NIH\ndetailee who assists with the function, and DO flexes the other staff\nif a particularly sensitive or urgent matter occurs (four additional\npersonnel)--but can only do this for short periods of time before\nsuffering mission degradation in other areas (such as Committee on\nForeign Investment in the United States, Supply Chain Risk Management,\nTechnical Surveillance Countermeasures, Foreign Travel, and\ncounterintelligence reviews of other employee types and incidents).\nTwo additional FTEs will be coming onboard to assist, full-time,\nwith vetting foreign visitors. At DO's current staffing level, DO can\nconduct counterintelligence checks on just over 20,000 visitors\nannually without mission degradation; thus, DO's current staffing is\nsufficient for steady-state operations. Staffing is not sufficient to\nvet other areas, such as principal investigators of research programs.\nLastly, by the end of the fiscal year, the new NIH-focused team\nmentioned above will have two to three new individuals to assist with\nvetting NIH-specific visitors, employees, and contractors.\nQuestion. How are you leveraging your resources to improve vetting\nfor individuals running critical projects?\nAnswer. Please see the memo depicting classified responses to\nunclassified QFRs.\nQuestion. What foreign governments pose the greatest threats to\nintellectual property created by taxpayer-funded research at American\nuniversities? How are they working to exploit our academic institutions\nto steal critical IP? Can you share any specific examples of that\nexploitation?\nAnswer. Please see the memo depicting classified responses to\nunclassified QFRs.\nQuestion. Have foreign nationals, acting surreptitiously on behalf\nof foreign governments, penetrated critical U.S. industries, including\nbut not limited to health-care and pharmaceutical research,\ninfrastructure, financial services, defense, robotics, and advanced\nchip processing? If yes, please explain what changes, including\nlegislative changes, are needed to stop or slow these incursions.\nAnswer. Yes. This requires a whole-of-government approach to\nstrengthen the ability of individual agencies to examine\ncounterintelligence concerns throughout the entirety of the supply\nchains for products and services procured. Additionally, government-\nfunded intellectual property must be better protected when developed in\ntandem with private industry; while public-private cooperation is\ncritical to maintaining the current pace of scientific advancement, the\nability of the government to safeguard particularly critical\ninformation, while balancing the need for collaboration, must remain a\npriority.\nQuestion. Should NIH consider the risks presented by foreign\nprincipal investigators when permitting access to United States genomic\ndata? If so, why ? If not, why not?\nAnswer. ONS supports both the NIH and HHS/OIG to address security\nissues so that all NIH-funded assets, including data, are appropriately\nprotected.\nONS is aware that NIH is clarifying policies that require\ndisclosure of all other support (including support from foreign\nentities), foreign components, and significant financial conflict of\ninterest. NIH is in the process of implementing other risk mitigation\nrecommendations from the ACD, as described by the NIH ACD Working\nGroup, and is also collaborating closely with ONS and the security and\nintelligence communities to broadly assess and dedicate resources to\naddress risks related to NIH equities.\nSpecific to genomic data, ONS is aware that the NIH Genomic Data\nSharing Policy (GDS) sets forth expectations and responsibilities to\nensure the timely, broad and responsible sharing of genomic data. NIH\noversight and control procedures have been implemented to verify that\ninvestigators and entities using such data do so in a manner consistent\nwith the NIH mission.\nQuestion. Should NIH assess the risks to national security and\nintellectual property when permitting data access to foreign principal\ninvestigators? If so, why? If not, why not?\nAnswer. HHS/ONS will continue to work with NIH to address\nscientific data misuse. NIH could strengthen its controls by continuing\nto support ONS's effort as it relates to counterintelligence and\ninsider threat activities, conducting a risk assessment, and\nimplementing additional appropriate security controls designed to\nsafeguard sensitive data. We also recommend that NIH continue its\ndevelopment and implementation of mechanisms to ensure data security\npolicies keep current with emerging threats. Lastly, we concur with\nHHS/OIG that NIH make security awareness training and security plans a\nrequirement for its funded PIs.\nONS is aware that NIH is working with Federal security and\nintelligence agencies to address security issues appropriately for\nprotection of all NIH-funded assets, including data.\nIt is imperative that risk assessments are conducted and\ncommensurate with emerging threat issues. This is exemplified by the\nfact that China has instituted policies that regulate access to\nbiological data and materials. The new Chinese regulations implement\nnew requirements for the use of human genetic resources that come from\nChinese participants. The rules, which went into effect on July 1,\n2019, require international scientists using biomaterials from China to\nhave a Chinese collaborator. Article 21 states that foreign\norganizations that use the materials must abide by Chinese law and work\nin cooperation with Chinese institutes. Article 24 states that all data\nand patents derived from such a collaboration must be shared with the\nChinese institution [www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/china-clamps-\ndown-on-foreign-use-of-chinese-genetic-material-and-data-66016]. This\ndevelopment could exacerbate the lack of data access reciprocity and\nnegatively impact future research partnerships and collaborations\nQuestion. Can genomic information be used to track or surveil\nindividuals?\nAnswer. ONS would be delighted to, in conjunction with NIH, respond\nto this question in a more secure environment.\nQuestion. What is the most effective unclassified tool you have to\ndetect the threat to taxpayer-funded research and deter that threat?\nWhat additional tools do you need?\nAnswer. NIH conducts outreach on a variety of policy issues of\nimportance to the biomedical research enterprise. Initiatives and\nprograms are continually refined to educate, improve situational\nawareness, and develop a mechanism to report suspicious activities at\nresearch entities that could represent an emerging national security\nthreat. Continued efforts are needed to improve and expand efforts to\neducate and provide training on security issues, elaborate on the\n``real world'' threat, and provide resources for mitigating identified\nrisks. We can provide a more thorough response within the accompanying\nclassified memo responding to unclassified QFRs.\n______\nQuestions Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden\nQuestion. What are HHS and NIH, respectively, doing to prevent\nracial bias and a talent drain in their efforts to address foreign\nthreats to U.S.-funded research?\nAnswer. HHS/ONS applies the same screening standards for all non-\nU.S. person visitors, regardless of origin. Further examination is\nbased on identified risk factors which are best discussed in a secure\nsetting.\nQuestion. Policy on Mixed Government and Non-Government Witnesses\non Panels: Waivers and waivers granted.\nAnswer. ONS is not positioned to answer this question.\nQuestion. Source of foreign threats.\nAnswer. This was covered in HHS/ONS prior response on appropriately\nclassified systems.\n______\nQuestions Submitted by Hon. Todd Young\nQuestion. Just like sharing access to sensitive intelligence\ninformation, should we think similarly about opening up certain\nprograms or research areas to certain students or professors depending\non their home country?\nAnswer. Identification of national security threats can be done in\na number of ways; shortcuts such as national origin, however, tend to\nintroduce serious errors that undermine the process and may lead to a\nchilling effect on research cooperation. Focus should be on the\nindividual, rather than the country, in order to ascertain legitimacy\nof access, verification of professional bona fides, competencies, and\nreferences.\nQuestion. Is there a model here for academia that is worth\nfollowing?\nAnswer. Recent proposed legislation and other policy shifts in the\nworks may provide a good foundation for academia to follow; however,\nall systems have vulnerabilities and flaws. The 2012 revision of the\nU.S. Select Agents and Toxins Regulations required the implementation\nof a personnel security program for vetting and continuously monitoring\npersonnel holding or seeking access to thirteen pathogens and toxins\nclassified as significant public safety and security risks to the\nUnited States (referred to as ``Tier 1 agents''). In response, several\ninstitutions that support research with these pathogens have\nindependently established behavioral threat assessment teams; these\nteams help institutional officials evaluate the suitability and\nreliability of incoming and existing laboratory personnel that work\nwith Tier 1 agents. These teams draw on the institutional offices of\nhuman resources, general counsel, security and law enforcement,\nenvironmental health and safety, and occupational health.\nPersonnel threats come in two forms: insider threats and external\nthreats. The overall effectiveness and acceptance of personnel security\nprograms hinges on sensitizing employees to the possibility that people\nin their workplace might harm others for personal reasons or be\nrecruited or manipulated by outside groups.\nRepresentatives from the research community agreed that addressing\npersonnel security in practice relies on employers:\nA.  Identifying individuals who pose a threat prior to hiring;\nB.  Identifying existing employees whose risk potential changes\nover time;\nC.  Identifying a threat when it arises; and\nD.  Managing threats safely and effectively after they are\ndetected.\nWhile these strategies can provide a baseline for risk mitigation\nas institutions begin to develop their personnel security programs,\neach institution should carefully consider all possible strategies and\nincorporate those approaches that best fit their facilities, threats,\nand community. The key is to develop programs that focus on minimizing\nand effectively mitigating the threat without limiting creativity and\nunconventional thinking, or creating a risk averse environment that\nmight be detrimental to scientific advancement.\nQuestion. Should we be limiting what countries we conduct sensitive\nresearch and development with?\nAnswer. HHS/ONS does not recommend such limitations, as they are\nbased on a security threat identification shortcut that has,\nhistorically, led to significant errors that undermine processes and\nminimize international cooperation based on temporary trends and\npolitical changes. Rather than limiting the countries, which is already\nreviewed by the visa application process, a risk assessment should be\nconducted to determine vulnerabilities and security concerns as a means\nto ascertain ``need to-know.'' This would facilitate proper vetting of\nindividuals and further the research effort.\n______\nQuestions Submitted by Hon. Robert Menendez\nQuestion. How do we make sure that the United States maintains a\ncompetitive edge in an age of increased cooperation with hostile\nactors/countries?\nAnswer. Ensuring a competitive edge while maintaining open and\ncontinuous contact with potentially hostile actors and countries\nrequires the individuals involved in that contact to be acutely aware\nof the potential risks involved with the contact, and how to respond to\nthose risks once actualized.\nAn example could involve researchers focusing on influenza\nvariants. Certain variants of influenza arise in natural reservoirs\nthat are outside the United States--such as certain phenotypes of Swine\nand Avian flu. Simply closing off research to countries in direct\ncompetition to the United States would also shut off the ability to\naccess those other phenotypes--leaving the United States particularly\nvulnerable should those phenotypes become involved in a pandemic. Thus,\nshutting off other countries itself becomes a national security\nconcern. Instead, researchers in this (and similar) spaces should be\ncontinuously educated on the risks to intellectual property inherent in\nthe places they conduct their research, as well as with whom they\nconduct their research. This education must include more than simply\nadvising the researchers of the risk; it must also include how to\nhandle that risk--specifically, reporting and safeguarding. This will\nvary based on the details of each project. However, a whole-of-\ngovernment approach will simplify reporting of such concerns when\nactualized, and may help identify such risks at an earlier stage when\nmitigation is simpler and more likely to protect the intellectual\nproperty. Further, connecting the requirement for this education with\nthe receipt of grant funding from any source will help ensure\nsaturation of the information throughout the research community.\nQuestion. What tools does Congress have to help our domestic\npharmaceutical industry and protect them from foreign influence?\nAnswer. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States,\nprovides certifications to Congress regarding cases that do not pose a\nnational security concern. HHS/ONS is also happy to work with Congress\nto ensure we have the tools to address this issue.\nQuestion. What additional efforts are needed in new and cutting-\nedge fields like genomics?\nAnswer. NIH is exploring different options for dealing with this\nimportant issue, and we are engaged in conversations with relevant\npartners. Working with ONS to have continued outreach, both internally\nand externally to NIH, and education on this topic is also essential.\nWe are looking at many different approaches, and it should be said that\nrestricting access to genomic data risks delaying the advancement of\nimportant research that could lead to treatment or cures for many\ndiseases, and could hinder the U.S., and global, bioeconomy, so the\nrisks and benefits of restricting access to genomic data must be\nweighed carefully. Consideration of negative impacts should go beyond\njust genomics, as restricting access to other scientifically valuable\nresources (e.g., biospecimens, other data types) also has the potential\nto delay important research and life-saving cures, and significantly\naffect our competitiveness on a global scale.\n______\nQuestion Submitted by Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse\nQuestion. How are Federal agencies working together to assist\nuniversities in safeguarding their data? What more can agencies do to\ncoordinate better with each other?\nAnswer. HHS/ONS works closely with NIH to discuss the risks they\nand their academic partners face. Additionally, HHS/ONS works closely\nwith both FBI and the ODNI/National Counterintelligence and Security\nCenter to assist universities in safeguarding their data. Additionally,\nONS's new NIH-focused branch has an external team that will work\ndirectly with universities.\n______\nPrepared Statement of Lawrence A. Tabak, D.D.S., Ph.D.,\nPrincipal Deputy Director, National Institutes of Health\nGood morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Wyden, and distinguished\nmembers of the committee. Thank you for your long-standing support of\nthe biomedical research enterprise and of the National Institutes of\nHealth (NIH) specifically. It is an honor to appear before you today to\ndiscuss how NIH works to protect the integrity of the U.S. biomedical\nenterprise and neutralize foreign threats to the integrity of taxpayer-\nfunded research.\nThe United States is the world leader in biomedical research. As\nthe largest public funder of that research, NIH sets the standard for\ninnovation and scientific discovery that aims to advance the health of\nall Americans. We exemplify and promote the highest levels of\nscientific integrity, public accountability, and social responsibility\nin the conduct of science. We promote open collaboration by leveraging\nformal and informal collaborations with scientists at research\ninstitutions around the world, which is imperative to solving the most\npressing and perplexing health challenges that are facing the American\npublic. This exchange of knowledge is an essential part of innovation,\nand it is critical to our global competitiveness. Foreign-born\nscientists contribute to improving health, fostering innovation, and\nadvancing science.\nMany recent scientific advances, such as sequencing the human\ngenome, or the development of the gene-editing tool kit known as\nCRISPR-Cas were predicated upon international collaborations. Since\n2000, 39 percent of U.S. Nobel prizes in physics, chemistry, and\nmedicine have been awarded to foreign-born scientists.\\1\\\nForeign-born scientists, trainees, and employees at American\nuniversities are hard at work assisting in the advancement of\nknowledge. U.S. scientists routinely collaborate productively with\ninvestigators in foreign countries, resulting in many scientific\nsuccesses.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ https://nfap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/DAY-OF-\nRELEASE.Nobel-Prize.October-20171.pdf.\nPartnerships with numerous foreign entities are also essential for\npredicting, and rapidly identifying and responding to threats from\nemerging infectious diseases and pathogens. For example, a joint\nworking group made up of NIH and National Natural Science Foundation of\nChina (NSFC) representatives developed a strategic research program\nthat identifies, reviews, and jointly funds bilateral projects that\naddress high priority infectious disease concerns, including\nantimicrobial resistant bacteria and evolving strains of influenza that\ncould cause global epidemics.\\2\\ Furthermore, because diseases can and\ndo occur in many parts of the world, we must rely on productive\nresearch collaborations and partnership programs with foreign entities\nto share information on seasonal and pre-pandemic influenza viruses,\nand to access strains of emerging infectious diseases such as SARS and\nMERS, Zika, Ebola, and many others.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\2\\ https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/us-china-collaborative-\nbiomedical-research-program.\nUnfortunately, we are aware that a few foreign governments have\ninitiated systematic programs to capitalize on the collaborative nature\nof biomedical research and unduly influence U.S.-based researchers. It\nis essential for us to continue vigilance and take additional actions\nto protect the integrity of the U.S. biomedical research enterprise,\nwhile also protecting important relationships with foreign scientists\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nworldwide.\nNIH's three areas of concern are:\n1.  Failure by some researchers at NIH-funded institutions to\ndisclose substantial contributions of resources from other\norganizations, including foreign governments, which threatens\nto distort decisions about the appropriate use of NIH funds;\n2.  Diversion of proprietary information included in grant\napplications or produced by NIH-supported biomedical research\nto other entities, including other countries; and\n3.  Failure by some peer reviewers to keep information in grant\napplications confidential; including, in some instances,\ndisclosure to foreign entities or other attempts to influence\nfunding decisions.\nNIH has taken, and continues to take, a proactive approach to\nidentifying, resolving, and preventing issues of concern.\nNIH identifies and monitors concerns through several channels. We\nregularly partner with colleagues at the Department of Health and Human\nServices (HHS), and other Federal agencies, such the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI), to exchange information on emerging threats. A new\ndashboard is being developed to assist NIH in responding to data\nrequests needed for its reviews in this context. In addition, NIH\nmaintains an open channel of communication with our funded research\ninstitutions and their investigators, several of which have proactively\ncontacted us with concerns.\nWe have also actively taken steps to increase awareness about peer\nreview integrity with our employees who lead scientific programs and\nreview meetings. For example, NIH staff were specifically trained to\nidentify and report suspicious activity on the part of key scientists\ndesignated in grant applications and peer reviewers to the Research\nIntegrity Officer in their NIH Institute or Center, or directly to our\ncentral research integrity official within the Office of the Director.\nWhen concerns are identified, we work with leadership within the\nawardee institution to quickly address the issue as appropriate. As of\nMay 2019, we have contacted more than 55 awardee institutions related\nto this issue, and this process is ongoing. Our efforts have directly\nor indirectly led to actions by awardee institutions (who have the\nauthority to take certain actions as employers). Such actions include:\nTerminations or suspensions of scientists who have engaged\nin egregious violations of NIH grant terms and conditions and\ninstitutional policies.\nInterventions to address previously un-reported affiliations\nwith foreign institutions.\nRelinquishment or refund of NIH funds.\nProhibition of certain individuals from serving as\ninvestigators on NIH grants.\nOutreach to FBI for assistance.\nDiscovery (through acquisition of certain foreign grants and\ncontracts) of overlapping or duplicative work, or conflicts in\nstating committed effort to research projects. This discovery\nhas led to NIH suspensions of active grants as appropriate.\nEfforts to raise awareness among institutional faculty about\ngovernment and institutional policies dealing with foreign\naffiliations and relationships (see, for example, the Penn\nState website).\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\3\\ https://www.research.psu.edu/international_affiliations.\nThere have also been situations in which honest mistakes were made\nby research investigators who were unaware of the requirement to\ndisclose other funding sources (both domestic and international) or\naffiliations with foreign entities. In these cases, we worked with the\ninstitutions, which took steps to help their employees understand\ndisclosure policies; both why they are important, and how to comply\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nwith relevant rules.\nWe will continue to address issues of concern. To mitigate security\nbreaches, we have improved the electronic systems that are used by\nresearchers to submit applications to NIH, and that are also used by\npeer reviewers to access applications for evaluations. Our security\nupdates include: two-factor authentication for electronic research\nsystem logins; using an all-electronic conflict-of-interest\ncertification; and development of a dashboard. A major focus of our\npreventive efforts is proactive communication to engage the research\ncommunity as partners. For example, on August 23, 2018, the NIH\nDirector issued a statement on protecting the integrity of U.S.\nbiomedical research,\\4\\ and sent a letter to officials at approximately\n10,000 organizations applying for NIH funding. The letter reinforced\nthat NIH and the U.S. biomedical research community at large have a\nvested interest in mitigating these unacceptable breaches of trust and\nconfidentiality that undermine the integrity of U.S. biomedical\nresearch.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\4\\ https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/\nstatements/statement-protecting-integrity-us-biomedical-research.\nWe are developing resources to help awardee institutions understand\nour expectations regarding research investigators who--in addition to\nNIH funding--receive additional research funding from domestic or\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nforeign sources.\nAs I mentioned, the U.S. biomedical research community at-large has\na vested interest in mitigating these unacceptable breaches of trust\nand confidentiality. Community engagement is such an important part of\nour activities. Last year, we convened a working group of the Advisory\nCommittee to the NIH Director (ACD) to develop recommendations related\nto foreign Influences on research integrity.\\5\\ We charged them to\nidentify robust methods to: (1) improve accurate reporting of all\nsources of research support, financial interests, and affiliations; (2)\nmitigate the risk to security of proprietary information while\ncontinuing NIH's long tradition of collaborations, including foreign\nscientists and institutions; and, (3) explore additional steps to\nprotect the integrity of peer review. Many of their recommendations,\nwhich were considered and adopted by the ACD, and conveyed to NIH\nthrough the ACD, have already been acted upon by NIH, as described\nabove. As recommended by the ACD, following input from the working\ngroup, we are working with key stakeholders to figure out how best to\ncollate and disseminate best practices, with the Association of\nAmerican Universities and the Association of Public and Land-Grant\nUniversities taking a lead role in these efforts. An update on these\nactivities will be presented and discussed publicly at the June 2019\nmeeting of the Advisory Committee to the NIH Director. We also\nrecognize that we will not be successful in our domestic efforts to\nprotect the integrity of the R&D enterprise if we do not work together\ninternationally with allies and like-minded partners to take\ncoordinated action. As such, we are working with the Department of\nState to engage key allies and partners to identify effective\napproaches to promote U.S. scientific and technological advances\nthrough international S&T cooperation, while simultaneously identifying\nand minimizing improper influence on the integrity of the American R&D\nenterprise.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\5\\ https://acd.od.nih.gov/working-groups/foreign-influences.html.\nWhile we have taken bold and concrete steps to bolster research\nintegrity and neutralize foreign threats against U.S. biomedical\nresearch, we remain conscious of how these actions could affect the\nmorale of honest and dedicated foreign researchers. In March 2019, we\nresponded to a joint letter \\6\\ from three Chinese American biomedical\nprofessional societies, in which they expressed concerns that policies\ndesigned to protect biomedical proprietary information may be singling\nout Chinese students and scholars working in the United States. In our\nresponse, published in the journal Science,\\7\\ we acknowledge these\nconcerns, and that the vast majority of Chinese scientists working in\nAmerica are committed to the cause of expanding knowledge for the\nbetterment of humankind, and to do so in a fair and honest way.\nImportantly, NIH reviews have identified concerns involving individuals\nwho are not of Chinese ethnicity\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\6\\ https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6433/1290.\n\\7\\ https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6433/1292.full.\nThe individuals violating laws and policies represent a small\nproportion of scientists working in and with U.S. institutions. We must\nensure that our responses to this issue do not create a hostile\nenvironment for colleagues who are deeply dedicated to advancing human\nhealth through scientific inquiry. We cannot afford to reject brilliant\nminds working honestly and collaboratively to provide hope and healing\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nto millions around the world.\nIn closing, as Principal Deputy Director of NIH, I can assure the\ncommittee that the senior leadership at NIH will continue to diligently\nprotect the integrity of U.S.-taxpayer funded research.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\n______\nQuestions Submitted for the Record to Lawrence A. Tabak, D.D.S., Ph.D.\nQuestions Submitted by Hon. Chuck Grassley\nQuestion. According to NIH, it operates both the intramural program\nand the extramural program for research activities. Within the\nintramural program, NIH's employees, contractors and affiliates who are\nU.S. citizens undergo background investigations. Further, prior to that\nbackground check, a Special Agency Check is conducted requiring\nfingerprints to be cross-checked with FBI criminal databases, including\nterrorist watch lists. According to NIH, a grantee institution in the\nextramural program, such as a university or other research institution,\nis responsible for any vetting, not NIH.\nMore than $8 out of $10 appropriated to NIH goes to the extramural\nprogram. At the committee hearing, I asked Dr. Tabak whether NIH\nconducts background checks, including a review for counter-intel\npurposes, on principal investigators prior to awarding a grantee\ninstitution taxpayer money. He answered, ``No sir, we do not, as they\nare employees of their home institution.''\nCan NIH condition the receipt of taxpayer money on the principal\ninvestigator passing the same background check that NIH employees must\npass? If so, why has NIH not made that a condition?\nAnswer. Through ongoing discussions with the extramural community,\nthe Department's Office of National Security, and our Federal partners,\nin particular those in security and law enforcement, NIH is actively\nexploring options and additional actions to address research integrity\nconcerns. If extramural investigators have long term (more than six\nmonth) access to Federal facilities or information systems, they are\nrequired to undergo background investigation for a determination of\neligibility for a PIV credential. The standards for this determination\nis whether the issuance of a credential would pose an unacceptable risk\nto people, property or information systems. At this time, we do not\nknow whether implementing such a background check requirement for\nextramural investigators that do not have long-term access to Federal\nfacilities or systems would be feasible or helpful. We must consider\nadverse effects on university administrative burden, especially if such\nan effort were to be taken at scale (involving hundreds of thousands of\nscientists every year).\nQuestion. If principal investigators were subject to the same\nbackground check as NIH employees, and were also subject to a review\nfor counterintelligence purposes, how would those checks help\nstrengthen grant integrity?\nAnswer. It is unclear whether this would strengthen grant\nintegrity. There is a risk that institutions might see these background\nchecks as a rationale for loosening their oversight.\nQuestion. If principal investigators were subject to the same\nbackground check as NIH employees, and were also subject to a review\nfor counterintelligence purposes, would those checks improve the\ngovernment's security posture? If so, how? If not, why not?\nAnswer. This question is outside the purview of the NIH.\nQuestion. What additional changes would improve the integrity of\nthe grant system and taxpayer-funded research? For example, should any\nchanges be made to government grant forms?\nAnswer. NIH understands and supports interest in modifying\ngovernment grant forms and/or application information, e.g., to include\nan assurance/certification from the authorized organization\nrepresentative (AOR) that the investigator(s) designated in the grant\napplication do(es) not have a criminal background or findings of sexual\nharassment, and that the investigator(s) fully disclosed all\naffiliations and other research support. This additional assurance/\ncertification would be governed by the existing, express\nacknowledgement by the AOR that any intentional or negligent\nmisrepresentation of the information contained in the certification may\nresult in criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including but\nnot limited to: (1) fines, restitution and/or imprisonment under 18\nU.S.C. Sec. 1001; (2) treble damages and civil penalties under the\nFalse Claims Act (31 U.S.C. Sec. 3729 et seq.); (3) double damages and\ncivil penalties under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act (31 U.S.C.\nSec. 3801 et seq.); (4) civil recovery of award funds; (5) suspension\nand/or debarment from all Federal procurement and non-procurement\ntransactions (FAR Subpart 9.4 or 2 CFR part 180); and (6) other\nadministrative penalties.\nQuestion. According to the Health and Human Services Inspector\nGeneral, NIH has recently referred for investigation 16 allegations of\nnoncompliance related to medical research. The Inspector General stated\nthe allegations primarily deal with the failure of principal\nresearchers to disclose foreign government affiliations.\nAt the committee hearing, I asked Dr. Tabak how NIH discovered\ncases for referral to the Inspector General. In response, he stated,\n``We flagged these in various ways, our own staff use algorithms to\ndetect potential untoward behavior. We also receive referrals from our\ncolleagues at HHS and the FBI and, increasingly, universities as they\nbecome more and more aware of this issue, are alerting us to potential\nissues as well.'' I also asked Dr. Tabak whether he would provide this\ncommittee a specific breakdown of how each referral originated, whether\nby NIH or a research institution. Dr. Tabak stated, ``We would provide\nthat for the record, but it would have to go in concert with the IG.\nWe've already made those referrals and they are ongoing\ninvestigations.''\nIn the past 5 years, how many referrals have HHS and the FBI sent\nto NIH? Please list each institution, all researchers subject to the\nreferral, and the reason for the referral.\nAnswer. NIH is not positioned to provide this information due to\ndynamic, ongoing investigations.\nQuestion. For those referrals that NIH sent to the Health and Human\nServices Inspector General, how many originated with NIH and how many\noriginated with a research institution or another agency? In your\nresponse, please provide the name of each research institution and\nagency. In addition, did any of the grantees receive new NIH grants or\nhave NIH grants renewed after NIH decided to refer the cases? If so,\nwhat was the total value of those grants?\nAnswer. From the current list of referrals to the OIG, two thirds\noriginated at NIH and one-third came to NIH from the FBI. We have put\nall new grant funding and renewals associated with these investigators\non administrative hold as questions are being addressed.\nQuestion. What foreign governments pose the greatest threats to\nintellectual property created by taxpayer-funded research at American\nuniversities? How are they working to exploit our academic institutions\nto steal critical IP? Can you share any specific examples of that\nexploitation?\nAnswer. This question falls outside of NIH's purview.\nQuestion. Have foreign nationals, acting surreptitiously on behalf\nof foreign governments, penetrated critical U.S. industries, including\nbut not limited to health-care and pharmaceutical research,\ninfrastructure, financial services, defense, robotics, and advanced\nchip processing? If yes, please explain what changes, including\nlegislative changes, are needed to stop or slow these incursions.\nAnswer. This question is outside the purview of the NIH.\nQuestion. A recent Inspector General report raised concerns with\nthe fact that NIH gave access to U.S. genomic data to for-profit\ncompanies from China ``even though the FBI has identified those\ncompanies as having ties to the Chinese Government.'' The report also\nfound that ``NIH did not consider the risk presented by foreign\nprincipal investigators when permitting access to United States genomic\ndata and has not assessed the risks to national security when\npermitting data access to foreign principal investigators.''\nIs NIH still providing companies with ties to the Chinese\nGovernment access to U.S. genomic data? If so, why?\nAnswer. NIH does not verify affiliations of principal investigators\nbeyond that of their home institution. NIH oversight and control\nprocedures, such as data access request review by Data Access\nCommittees and ongoing tracking of data use, allow NIH to verify that\nstewardship of the data by investigators and responsible entities is\nconsistent with the terms and conditions for use of the data.\nRecognizing the importance of transparency in how these data are\nbeing used, NIH does publicly provide information related to data\nsubmitted to dbGaP, such as a list of all approved users for each\ndataset, their institutional affiliations, and their proposed research\nuse of those data.\nQuestion. Has NIH changed its policy to now consider the potential\nnational security risks in giving foreign Principal Investigators\naccess to U.S. genomic data? If not, why not?\nAnswer. NIH continues to take national security risks into\nconsideration regarding all of its assets and is working with our\npartners in the Federal security and intelligence agencies to address\nthese issues appropriately. NIH notes that these risks are not limited\nto (or even typically focused on) human genomic data.\nNIH's commitment to tackling these important challenges are\nreflected in a variety of recent actions, including the convening of a\nNIH Advisory Committee to the Director (ACD) Working Group for Foreign\nInfluences on Research Integrity. From this engagement, the ACD\nrecommended that NIH should increase communication and awareness with\ninstitutions and organizations, mitigate and prevent risks, and work\nwith partners across the government to monitor, report, and enhance\nsecurity to protect America's research integrity.\nAs it pertains to risk mitigation, NIH is clarifying policies that\nrequire disclosure of all other support (including support from foreign\nentities), foreign components, and significant financial conflict of\ninterest. NIH is in the process of implementing other risk mitigation\nrecommendations from the ACD, as described by the NIH ACD Working\nGroup, and is also collaborating closely with the HHS Office of\nNational Security and the security and intelligence communities to\nbroadly assess and dedicate resources to address risks related to NIH\nequities.\nQuestion. What particular areas of genomic data did NIH provide to\nWuXi Nextcode Genomics, Shenzhen BGI Technology Company, and other\ngenomics entities associated with the Chinese Government? Have the FBI\nand the intelligence community received relevant information about the\ntype of genomic information these entities accessed? How many\nAmericans' genomic information was provided to these foreign entities?\nAnswer. The table below provides the study name, number of\nparticipants, and type(s) of data that were accessed by Shenzen BGI\nTechnology Company, BGI Americas, BGI Research, and WuXi Nextcode\nGenomics. Given that the majority of the security conversations on this\ntopic have taken place in classified settings, we cannot speak to the\nspectrum of briefings received by the FBI and the intelligence\ncommunity.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nData Types\nStudy Name and Number of Participants    Disease Area        Included\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)         Cancer            Whole Genome\n(11,429 Participants)                                    Genotyping\nWhole Genome\nSequencing\nWhole Exome\nSequencing\nRNA Sequencing\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFoundation Medicine Adult Cancer       Cancer            Targeted\nClinical Dataset (FM-AD) (18,004                         Genomic\nParticipants)                                            Sequencing\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGenotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)      Normal tissue,    Whole Genome\n(752 Participants)                     no disease        Genotyping\nExome\nGenotyping\nWhole Exome\nSequencing\nRNA Sequencing\nGene\nPExpression\nWhole Genome\nSequencing\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhole-Genome Sequencing of Acute       Acute Myeloid     Whole Genome\nMyeloid Leukemia (170 Participants)    Leukemia          Genotyping\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTranscriptome Sequencing of Pediatric  Acute Myeloid     Whole Genome\nAML FAB-M7 (15 Participants)           Leukemia          Genotyping\nWhole Genome\nSequencing\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSequencing of Medulloblastoma (93      Medulloblastoma   Whole Genome\nParticipants)                          (type of brain    Genotyping\ncancer)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEstrogen Receptor Positive Breast      Breast Cancer     Whole Genome\nCancer: Aromatase Inhibitor Response                     Genotyping\nStudy (115 Participants)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuestion. What is the most effective unclassified tool you have to\ndetect the threat to taxpayer-funded research and deter that threat?\nWhat additional tools do you need?\nAnswer. NIH is employing a multi-pronged approach to develop\nproactive programs to minimize the likelihood of problems in the\nfuture. To date, informing the research community and the extramural\nstaff at NIH to raise awareness, and partnering with other agencies\nhave been effective strategies.\nInforming the research community: Raising awareness of the threat\nat awardee institutions has been a powerful tool. We continue to urge\nuniversities to look closely at their organizations to mitigate\nunscrupulous practices by individuals that aim to capitalize on the\ncollaborative nature of the U.S. biomedical enterprise. Regular\ncommunications to the extramural community over the last several years\nhave focused on protecting the integrity of U.S. biomedical research\nand the imperative to inform NIH of any foreign support. These\ncommunications have included a number of notices and statements to the\ncommunity, including the unprecedented step of the NIH Director issuing\na letter to officials at 10,000 recipient institutions. This letter\ninformed the research community that the agency is aware that some\nforeign entities have mounted systematic programs to influence NIH-\nsupported researchers and peer reviewers, as well as to take advantage\nof the long tradition of trust, fairness, and excellence of NIH\nsupported research activities.\\1\\ Furthermore, NIH convened a working\ngroup of the Advisory Committee to the NIH Director (ACD) on Foreign\nInfluences on Research Integrity. This panel comprised leaders in\nhigher education, members of the extramural community, and experts in\nsecurity, and was charged with assisting the ACD, which made\nrecommendations to the agency which are currently being implemented.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/\nstatements/statement-protecting-integrity-us-biomedical-research.\nNIH regularly communicates with grantees to provide training and\ncompliance support for issues involving conflict of interest\nrequirements at NIH-led conferences such as the NIH Regional Seminars.\nThis information is also communicated by NIH through professional\norganizations such as the Federal Demonstration Partnership, Society\nfor Research Administrators, American Association of Universities,\nCouncil on Governmental Relations, Association of Public and Land-grant\nUniversities, and the National Council of University Research\nAdministrators. There have been a number of special meetings involving\nthese groups and others to address the recent concerns on foreign\ninfluence. In addition, NIH recently developed an online training\nmodule \\2\\ on Financial Conflict of Interest as a resource for both NIH\nstaff and the extramural community. NIH's outreach and engagement have\nfacilitated extensive faculty outreach at research organizations as\nwell as led to developing and sharing best practices.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\2\\ https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2018/12/03/new-financial-conflict-\nof-interest-training-module-available/.\nNIH has also been reaching out to recipient institutions directly.\nNIH has contacted over 60 institutions regarding specific scientists\nwho may have failed to disclose substantial foreign research support or\nfinancial conflicts of interest or who may have engaged in substantial\nbreaches of peer review integrity. This outreach has led to referrals\nto OIG, communications with FBI, disciplinary actions by the relevant\ninstitutions (including terminations or resignations), revisions of\ngrant terms, and new efforts on the part of institutions to enhance\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\noversight and security of their research operations.\nWe have strong indication that these communication strategies are\nworking. A report on Actions Taken by Universities to Address Growing\nConcerns about Security Threats and Undue Foreign Influence on\nCampus,\\3\\ issued by the American Association of Universities (AAU) and\nthe Association of Public and Land-grant Universities and updated in\nApril 2019, shares practices that universities are employing to\n``ensure the security of research, protect against intellectual\nproperty theft and academic espionage, and prevent actions or\nactivities by foreign governments and/or other entities that seek to\nexert undue foreign influence or which infringe on core academic\nvalues.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\3\\ https://www.aplu.org/members/councils/governmental-affairs/\nEffective-Sci-Sec-Practices-What-Campuses-are-Doing.pdf.\nPartnering with other agencies: NIH is actively partnering with\nother Federal departments and agencies to address concerns related to\nundue foreign influence on the biomedical research enterprise. These\nFederal partners include the Central Intelligence Agency, Federal\nBureau of Investigation, HHS Office of Inspector General, HHS Office of\nNational Security (ONS), Department of Defense, Department of State,\nDepartment of Energy, and the National Science Foundation. Staff within\nthe intelligence community, FBI, DOE, and NSF, for example, have noted\nthat NIH is well ahead of other Federal agencies in addressing and\ncommunicating concerns of possible undue foreign influence on research\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfunding.\nThe most effective unclassified tool we've used to date has been\nclose work and partnership with institutions and with law enforcement\non specific cases. These partnerships have led to extensive discovery\nabout the nature of the threats, to actions by the relevant\ninstitutions against certain investigators, to referrals to the OIG,\nand to institutional implementation of additional internal systems\ncontrol measures.\nWe look forward to ongoing work with institutions, with OIG, and\nwith other agency offices/contacts (including FBI, DNI, DOE, NSF, DOD,\nHHS/ONS, and State).\nQuestions Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden\nQuestion. Potential Damage to U.S. Research from Attacks on Foreign\nResearchers: The Houston Chronicle recently reported that over the past\n18 months, three MD Anderson senior researchers or administrators of\nChinese descent have retired, resigned, or been placed on\nadministrative leave. Some believe a toxic climate and perception of\nracial profiling hastened their departures. Two of the researchers\nsubsequently took positions at Chinese institutions. In March, a group\nof Chinese American scientists voiced concern in a strongly worded\nletter in the journal Science that recent rhetoric and proposals by the\nNIH and FBI could lead to unjust targeting of Chinese scientists. In\nMay, the magazine ran an editorial entitled ``Two Threats to U.S.\nScience.'' The two threats it identified were inadequate research\nfunding and disparagement of foreign scientists working in the U.S. and\nthe immigration roadblocks to their staying in the U.S. What are HHS\nand NIH, respectively, doing to prevent racial bias and a talent drain\nin their efforts to address foreign threats to U.S.-funded research?\nAnswer. NIH has a responsibility, in coordination with other\nFederal agencies and with institutions, to strive to assure an\nenvironment of compliance and ethical conduct of research. Stealth\nemployment and research support in foreign countries and egregious\nviolations of peer review norms pose a serious threat to the integrity\nand credibility of the entire research enterprise.\nNIH is focusing its efforts on enhancing research integrity across\nall our processes and systems. The extraordinary contributions of\nforeign nationals to American science are indisputable. As just one\nexample, 24 percent of U.S. Nobel prizes have been awarded to foreign-\nborn scientists. The biomedical research workforce continues to be\ngreatly enriched and strengthened by scientists who come to our shores\nfrom many parts of the world. The overwhelming majority of researchers\nparticipating in NIH grants, whether U.S.- or foreign-born, are honest\ncontributors to the advancement of knowledge that benefits us all.\nDriving away talented scientists from other countries would have a\nprofoundly negative effect on American productivity. See NIH Director\nStatement in Science \\4\\ responding to concerns of Chinese scientists.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\4\\ https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6433/1292.\nThe Hoover Report \\5\\ highlights a systematic effort to keep\nAmerican employers in the dark about Thousand Talents awards. Our\nobservations are consistent with the Hoover Report statement.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\5\\ https://www.hoover.org/research/chinas-influence-american-\ninterests-promoting-constructive-vigilance.\nThe challenge is to find ways to build and continue important and\nsuccessful relationships with foreign scientists around the world while\nsimultaneously protecting the Nation's biomedical innovations and\nproprietary information. The Advisory Committee to the Director, with\nthe assistance of a working group,\\6\\ has made recommendations to NIH\non best approaches to deal with this issue, and NIH is taking action on\nthese recommendations. Also, NIH is working with other Federal\nagencies, scientific professional societies, and grantee institutions\nto address this challenge. NIH is making clear statements about the\nimportance of international collaboration with each statement \\7\\ or\npresentation \\8\\ on the topic of threats to the U.S. biomedical\nresearch enterprise.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\6\\ https://acd.od.nih.gov/working-groups/foreign-influences.html.\n\\7\\ https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6433/1292.\n\\8\\ https://acd.od.nih.gov/documents/presentations/\n06142019Foreign.pdf.\nQuestion. Policy on Mixed Government and Non-Government Witnesses\non Panels: Your agency told the Finance Committee that its witness\nwould not participate on a panel at this hearing that included both\ngovernment and non-government witnesses, claiming there is a\nlongstanding OMB policy prohibiting this. However, there are numerous\nexamples where your agency has allowed witnesses to testify on ``mixed\npanels.'' Over the past 10 years, Federal Government witnesses,\nincluding those from your agency, have testified before the Finance\nCommittee on panels with non-government witnesses more than 40 times.\nThis has also been the case with other Senate committees. In April\n2019, an NIH witness testified on a panel with non-government witnesses\nbefore the Senate Aging Committee. An NIH witness also testified on a\npanel with non-government witnesses before this same committee in July\n2017. In March 2018, the Secretary of DHS herself testified on a panel\nwith non-government witnesses before the Senate Select Committee on\nIntelligence. Why were these witnesses permitted to testify before\nother Senate Committees on mixed panels, but your witness was not\npermitted to do so at the Finance Committee's June 5th hearing? If\nwaivers were granted for witnesses to testify on mixed panels at other\ncommittee hearings, why were those waivers granted for the other\nhearings but not the June 5th hearing? Please provide copies of (1) the\nOMB policy that allegedly prevents government witnesses from testifying\non panels with non-government witnesses; (2) any waivers granted for\nthe recent Aging and Intelligence hearings where government witnesses\nfrom NIH and DHS respectively testified with non-government witnesses;\nand (3) any request submitted to OMB for your witness to testify at the\nJune 5th hearing and the OMB response along with an explanation why a\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nwaiver was not granted for the June 5th Finance Committee hearing?\nAnswer. The Department of Health and Human Services received\nguidance stating this administration would continue the longstanding\npractice of prior administrations by allowing executive branch\nofficials to testify at a congressional hearing only on a first panel\nthat is separate from non-executive branch witnesses. Accommodations\nmay be made on a case-by-case basis, as appropriate. HHS and NIH are\nappreciative that we could agree to an arrangement that provided for\nour testimony at the hearing alongside other executive branch\nwitnesses.\nQuestion. Source of Foreign Threats: During the hearing, Senator\nWyden asked Dr. Tabak and the first panel of government witnesses to\nidentify the general number, or a range, of countries that currently\nconstituted the source of the foreign threat. Dr. Tabak responded that\nhe could not do so in an unclassified setting and would do so in the\nclassified briefing. Would you please provide a separate, classified\nresponse that identifies the specific countries that you believe\ncurrently present a threat to U.S. research and describe the nature of\nthat threat?\nAnswer. We defer to the Department of State, as this question falls\nwithin their jurisdiction.\n______\nQuestions Submitted by Hon. John Thune\nQuestion. One of the purposes of this hearing is to explore how\nforeign countries may be exploiting our open research institutions.\nWhat countries would you say are the top three or four countries that\nengage in this activity? Do you see these countries primarily targeting\nthe larger research universities, or do you see them targeting small\nuniversities in the Midwest, for example?\nAnswer. We defer to the Department of State, as this question falls\nwithin their jurisdiction.\nQuestion. The HHS Office of Inspector General recently released a\nreport stating that NIH did not concur with the Inspector General's\nrecommendation to develop a security framework, conduct a risk\nassessment, and implement additional controls for sensitive data in the\ncontext of NIH Genomic Data. Why did NIH not concur with this\nrecommendation?\nAnswer. NIH is sensitive to the concerns raised in the OIG report.\nAs stated in NIH's agency comments, NIH did not concur with OIG's\nfinding and corresponding recommendation in regard to its specificity\nto foreign investigator access to genomic data in particular. NIH did\nnot concur with the OIG's recommendations for several reasons, listed\nbelow.\nThe principal documentation cited by OIG in their report is\nbased on a single congressional testimony that speculates a\n``theoretical risk'' of negative implications for the U.S. by\nthe open sharing of genomic information. This argument seems\nspecious, since it is not limited to human genomic data\nmaintained in controlled access.\nThe current NIH process includes institutional sign-off and\nagreement to follow certain norms and standards practices which\nis the standard NIH process to establish controls for many\nmechanisms such as the submission of funding applications,\ncontracts, and other types of agreements. Thus, institutions\nmaintain the responsibility to follow these norms and\nstandards. NIH does not independently administer policies to\ndifferent types of investigators as this would be inefficient,\nburdensome, and difficult to monitor and enforce, ultimately\nleading to inconsistent policy implementation.\nA robust security framework is already in place in the form\nof dbGaP. When requesting access to human genomic data in\ndbGaP, all institutions, whether foreign or domestic, must sign\noff and agree to the same participant protection principles and\ndata security practices described in the NIH Genomic Data\nSharing Policy, thus assuring their responsible stewardship and\nappropriate use of human genomic data. Also, a NIH Data Access\nCommittee will only approve a request if the proposed research\nuse is consistent with the appropriate uses of the data, as\ndelineated by the institution that submitted the data. Such\npolicies and guidelines have been established to control the\naccess or transfer of human genomic data, irrespective of\nwhether the investigator is foreign or domestic.\nIn addition, the NIH Security Best Practices document outlines\nexpectations and best practices for key provisions such as security\nguidelines, controls for servers, controls for copies of data and their\ndestruction, and guidance for cloud computing. The document also\nreferences the Center for Internet Security, NIST, and the U.S.G.\nConfiguration Baseline for benchmarks and best practices for security\nconfigurations, standards, and baselines, which are widely accepted by\nFederal agencies. Thus, based on process and guidelines that have been\nestablished for data submission, access, management, and security, NIH\nhas mechanisms and controls in place that have successfully addressed\nthe risks associated with the sharing of human genomic data through\ncontrolled-access repositories.\n______\nQuestions Submitted by Hon. Todd Young\nfive eyes intelligence alliance\nQuestion. The Five Eyes is widely regarded as the world's most\nsignificant intelligence alliance. The origins of it can be traced back\nto the context of the Second World War and by its necessity of sharing\nvital information mainly between Britain and the United States so both\ncountries could enhance the allied war effort. ``Five Eyes'' was\nformally founded in the aftermath of the Second World War, through the\nmultilateral agreement, known as the UKUSA Agreement, on March 5, 1946.\nInitially, compromising only the UK and the United States, it\nexpanded to also include Canada in 1948 and Australia and New Zealand\nin 1956. Thereby, the ``Five Eyes'' term was created from the lengthy\n``Australia/Canada/New Zealand/United Kingdom/United States Eyes Only''\nclassification level that included the ``eyes'' that could have access\nto high-profile papers and information.\nFor more than 70 years this alliance of like-minded allies has\nserved our intelligence community well.\nJust like sharing access to sensitive intelligence information,\nshould we think similarly about opening up certain programs or research\nareas to certain students or professors depending on their home\ncountry?\nIs there a model here for academia that is worth following?\nShould we be limiting what countries we conduct sensitive research\nand development with?\nAnswer. We defer to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the HHS\nOffice of National Security, or the Office of the Inspector General for\nthe U.S. Department of State, as this question falls within their\njurisdiction.\n______\nQuestions Submitted by Hon. Robert Menendez\nQuestion. U.S. versus Global Research: The United States'\nleadership role is being threatened as other countries are pouring more\nand more money into research, with some estimates claiming that China\nwill outspend the United States in total research and development by\nthe end of this decade. Combine this with the fact that China has\ncontinuously tried and succeeded in infiltrating our publicly funded\nresearch initiatives, it is not hard to see the U.S. ceding more ground\nto our adversaries when it comes to innovation and technology.\nHow do we make sure that the U.S. maintains a competitive edge in\nan age of increased cooperation with hostile actors/countries?\nAnswer. Provision of support for biomedical research is crucial to\nensuring the U.S. position. However, it is more than money that drives\nthe biomedical research system; it is also the integrity of the system\nand the flexibility of independent investigators balancing scientific\nopportunities with public health needs.\nQuestion. What tools does Congress have to help our domestic\npharmaceutical industry and protect them from foreign influence?\nAnswer. This question is outside the purview of the NIH.\nQuestion. What additional efforts are needed in new and cutting-\nedge fields like genomics?\nAnswer. NIH's current system for protecting against the risks and\nemerging threats identified by NIH for the sharing of human genomic\ndata has been successful thus far. This system involves rigorous NIH\ncontrols, such as access request review by Data Access Committees, that\nverify investigators and entities using genomic data are doing so (1)\nin a manner consistent with the NIH mission, (2) to advance science and\nhealth, and (3) to enable NIH to maximize its return on investment.\nData Access Committees also provide ongoing tracking of who has access\nto data and how it is used over the course of the project. Recognizing\nthe importance of transparency in how these data are being used, NIH\nprovides information and statistics accessible by the public on the\ndata submitted to the NIH database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP),\nas well as a list of all approved users for each dataset, their\ninstitutional affiliations, and their proposed research use of those\ndata.\nAs technologies progress, there may be a need to further refine\nNIH's system of providing access to human genomic data. The Novel and\nExceptional Technology and Research Advisory Committee, or NExTRAC, may\nbe able to assist NIH with such efforts. The NExTRAC is a Federal\nadvisory committee that provides transparent advice to the NIH Director\nabout the scientific, safety, ethical, and social issues associated\nwith emerging biotechnologies. The NExTRAC will be an important tool to\nhelp NIH make sure that its policies, guidance, and oversight systems\nkeep pace with the rapidly accelerating landscape of biomedical\nresearch.\nQuestion. Budget: We've seen a reoccurring theme from this\nadministration of abdicating our global leadership on a broad range of\nissues.\nWhat is the current President's budget request for our research and\ndevelopment agencies/institutions, including NIH, NASA, the Department\nof Energy's Science Office, the EPA, and the National Science\nFoundation?\nAnswer. The President's FY 2020 budget request included a proposed\nbudget for NIH of $34.4 billion. While NIH cannot speak on behalf of\nNASA, DOE, EPA, and NSF, the ``Research and Development'' chapter of\nthe Analytical Perspectives volume of the President's budget includes a\ntable showing Federal R&D funding by agency. Note that figures in that\ntable for NIH do not include NIH research training and research funded\nby program evaluation financing resources.\nQuestion. While protecting intellectual property and our scientific\nresearch and technology is critical, how does cutting the funding of\nthese programs allow the United States to remain competitive?\nAnswer. The President's FY 2020 budget request includes funding for\nNIH to support the highest priority biomedical research. This funding\nis also key to ensuring a strong biomedical research workforce that can\neffectively advance discovery.\n______\nPrepared Statement of Hon. Ron Wyden,\na U.S. senator From Oregon\nA few key points to make this morning on taxpayer-funded research\nin America. First, our country is more entrepreneurial, our economy is\nstronger, and our lives as Americans are better because our scientific\ncommunity attracts so many of the world's brightest minds. That is a\nstrength to be protected--a part of our national character that must\nnot be diminished.\nForeign-born scientists put Americans on the moon. They worked on\nthe Manhattan Project. Nearly a third of all American Nobel laureates\nwere born outside the U.S. Look back at 2016, when six U.S.-based\nscientists won Nobel Prizes. All were born in other countries.\nIt goes without saying that individuals and governments outside the\nU.S. are going to want to chip away at our lead. That's particularly\ntrue when it comes to scientific breakthroughs that lead to valuable IP\nand entrepreneurship. Academic institutions and other research\norganizations based in this country need to understand and respond to\nthose concerns--just like Federal agencies and private companies do.\nBut overreaching with barriers that turn away bright students or\ncut off lines of communication with scientists from other countries\nwould do a lot more harm than good. And targeting Americans who happen\nto be descendants of recent immigrants is as bone-headed as it gets.\nDr. Alicia Carriquiry, distinguished professor at Iowa State\nUniversity, put it this way: ``Without foreign-born researchers, the\nentire system of higher education in the United States would collapse\nin a minute.''\nLater this morning, the Finance Committee will hear from Dr. Joe\nGray of the Oregon Health and Science University. Nobody knows better\nthan Dr. Gray how vitally important foreign-born researchers and\ninternational collaboration are to this country and our institutions.\nThe U.S. would not be capable of scientific breakthrough without them--\nperiod.\nSecond, any breakthrough in medicine or technology ought to be\ncheered as long as it leads to better lives for Americans. And if the\nU.S. suspects that American IP or technology has been stolen, this\nNation has the power to do something about it.\nFinally, while the committee examines this issue today, it's also\nimportant to take a step back to look at the broader context of our\ncommitment to scientific research.\nWhen you take inflation into account, Federal investments in\nscience and research have steadily declined for decades. State\ninvestments in higher ed have also dropped, starving research\nuniversities of funding.\nThe quickest way to turn the lights out in health research\nlaboratories across America would be to enact the Trump\nadministration's proposed budget cuts to NIH.\nAnd just a few months ago, the president also signed an executive\norder threatening to cut off research funding for universities over a\nbaseless panic dealing with speech on campus. Fortunately, the order\nwas toothless.\nSo when you take the broader view of threats to research in\nAmerica, it's clear the biggest danger comes from within, especially\nwith an administration that often takes anti-science positions.\nWith respect to foreign threats, what's true with private\nbusinesses and government agencies is true for research institutions.\nThey need to take responsible steps to protect themselves and their\nwork. That doesn't mean closing the door to or placing undue burdens on\nthe foreign-born students and scientists who make life changing\ndiscoveries together with Americans.\nI want to thank our witnesses for joining the committee today, and\nI look forward to questions.\n______\nAssociation of American Universities\n1200 New York Avenue, NW, Suite 550\nWashington, DC 20005\nP: 202-408-7500\nwww.aau.edu\nAmerica's leading research universities take national security threats\nposed by international actors seriously and are actively working to\nmitigate those threats. Universities share a vested interest with the\nfederal government in protecting intellectual property, proprietary\ninformation, trade secrets, and classified or otherwise controlled\ngovernment information resulting from federally funded research.\nStriking the right balance between controlling sensitive technological\ninformation and maintaining the free flow of fundamental scientific\nknowledge and international talent is vital to protecting America's\nnational security, maintaining the nation's role as the world's leader\nin science and innovation, and continuing the economic growth enabled\nby scientific and technological advances.\nIn light of recent concerns about foreign security threats, AAU and\nother higher-education associations are working together with law\nenforcement, the intelligence community, federal science agencies, and\nCongress to secure research on our university campuses. For example,\nlast September AAU, along with the American Council on Education, the\nAssociation of Public and Land-grant Universities, and the FBI, held a\nsummit on security that brought together high-level university\nadministrators, key FBI leadership, and representatives from agencies\nthat fund federal scientific initiatives. This April, Senator Mark\nWarner (D-VA) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) convened representatives from the\nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI, and the\nDepartment of Homeland Security in two classified briefings that\nengaged over 75 university presidents and chancellors. APLU plans to\nhold a similar briefing at its upcoming Counsel of Presidents meeting.\nAAU and other higher education associations have also actively engaged\nour members in discussions about how better to secure academic\nresearch. Last fall, AAU and APLU conducted a survey of universities on\neffective practices for securing research and guarding against undue\nforeign interference. In April, our two associations sent a report on\nthese effective practices to our institutions to help improve how they\nsecure the important research they perform on behalf of the federal\ngovernment.\nEven as we continually improve our security protocols, we must guard\nagainst measures that would stifle the very openness and collaboration\nthat are necessary to advance science and technology. This is key to\nmaintaining America's scientific and technological preeminence--itself\ncritical to our national security, economic competitiveness, and\nquality of life.\nLikewise, we must guard against measures that would unnecessarily stem\nthe flow of foreign research talent to our shores. America has remained\non the cutting edge of science because U.S. institutions attract and\nretain the best and brightest foreign researchers. U.S. visa and\nimmigration policies must continue to encourage talented students and\nscholars from around the world to come to this country and actively\ncontribute to advancing American science and the U.S. economy.\nFinally, the United States must invest more in critical areas of\nscientific research and scientific talent development to ensure that we\ndo not fall behind China and other competitors who are currently making\nsuch investments. We must commit to developing stronger domestic STEM\ntalent; making strong investments in the research programs supported by\nthe National Science Foundation, the NIH, NASA, the Departments of\nDefense and Energy, and other major federal research agencies; and\nincreasing funding for emerging areas of science such as quantum\ninformation, artificial intelligence, robotics, advanced manufacturing,\nand biotechnology.\nIn 2006 AAU released a report calling for the creation of a new\nNational Defense Education and Innovation Initiative that highlighted\nthe need for major investments in domestic research and talent\ndevelopment. The report envisioned modern-day investments similar in\nmagnitude to federal investments in science during the years following\nthe launch of Sputnik in 1957. It's thanks to this forward-looking leap\nin investment that we have the Defense Advanced Research Projects\nAgency, NASA, and the National Defense Education Act. AAU urges\nCongress to consider the report's recommendations to bolster our\nnation's security, strength, and competitiveness on an ever-changing\nglobal stage.\nCommunications\n----------\nAmerican Association of Immunologists (AAI)\n1451 Rockville Pike, Suite 650\nRockville, MD 20852\n(301) 634-7743\nStatement of JoAnne L. Flynn, Ph.D., President\nThe American Association of Immunologists (AAI), the nation's\nlargest professional association of research scientists and physicians\nwho study the immune system, appreciates having this opportunity to\nsubmit testimony for the record regarding the Senate Finance\nCommittee's June 5, 2019, hearing on ``Foreign Threats to Taxpayer-\nFunded Research: Oversight Opportunities and Policy Solutions.'' AAI\nmembers are research scientists and physicians who live and work in the\nUnited States and in countries throughout the world. What they share is\nan academic expertise in, and professional commitment to, understanding\nthe immune system and to advancing ways to prevent, treat, and cure\ndisease.\nAAI recognizes and greatly appreciates the strong support--and robust\nfunding--that Congress and American taxpayers have provided for\nbiomedical research. Most AAI members receive funding from the National\nInstitutes of Health (NIH) to support their research, and are gratified\nthat their work is strongly supported on a bipartisan basis. Our\nmembers know that, with this funding, comes the responsibility to work\nhard to both advance our research and protect the integrity of science\nand the scientific enterprise. AAI has been made aware in recent months\nby the NIH, this Committee, and press reports, among other sources, of\nconcerns about threats posed by foreign countries and foreign nationals\nto U.S. national security and U.S. intellectual property. AAI looks\nforward to working with Congress and the NIH to address threats to the\nresearch and innovations to which our members devote their professional\nlives.\nIt is essential, however, before moving forward, for Congress to\nunderstand fully the collaborative nature of science and the urgent\nneed for international collaborations if the U.S. is to advance\nscience, foster innovation, and remain the world's leader in biomedical\nresearch. I can best illustrate this, I believe, by describing my own\nexperience. As a professor in the Department of Microbiology and\nMolecular Genetics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine,\nI have spent most of my career studying tuberculosis (TB), an infection\ncaused by a bacterium. With 10 million cases and 1.3 million deaths in\n2017, TB causes even more deaths than HIV. According to the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), 25 percent of the world's\npopulation is currently infected with TB; if left untreated, about 5-10\npercent of those infected will develop the disease. Preventing TB\nglobally not only protects the U.S. from this disease, but also\nimproves the health of people in some of the poorest nations in the\nworld.\nAs a result of--and to further--my research, I have developed extensive\nties in the international research community. I have deep experience\ncollaborating with scientific partners in other countries through\nresearch projects sponsored by both the NIH and the Bill and Melinda\nGates Foundation. In my view, it is essential for U.S. researchers\nstudying TB to work with scientists in countries where the incidence of\nTB is high. Therefore, while TB research is performed in many\ncountries, I have worked closely with scientists in Asia and Africa,\nwhere several poor countries have the largest number of cases. My lab\nhas partnered with outstanding scientists in South Africa, where the\nincidence of TB is very high; by coordinating our efforts, we are\nworking to identify new methods for treatment and prevention of this\ndisease. My colleagues and I are also working with scientists in the\nUnited Kingdom and Denmark, where new drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines\nagainst TB are being developed, providing these collaborators with an\nimportant avenue for testing potential interventions. I have also\ntraveled to many different countries around the world, speaking about\nmy research at seminars and international meetings, and discussing with\nindividual scientists our shared interests. These interactions are\ncritical to maintaining collaborative relationships and promoting\noutstanding science in all countries.\nIn conjunction with my research, I have trained more than a dozen young\nresearchers from many different countries (including Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, Canada, China, Iceland, India, Malaysia, Moldova, New\nZealand, Nigeria, and the former Soviet Union). I believe strongly that\nthese young scientists are critical not only to the advancement of TB\nresearch, but also to the scientific enterprise of the U.S. While some\nof these scientists return to their home countries to perform research\nthere (and may collaborate with U.S. scientists), others stay in the\nU.S. to run their own labs or work in the broader research enterprise.\nAlthough AAI does not have sufficient expertise to recommend ways to\npromote national security or prevent the theft of intellectual\nproperty, we believe that better educating NIH funded scientists and\nthe institutions where they work about required disclosures (including\nof foreign grant support or faculty appointments, and affiliations with\nforeign labs); prohibited commercial and institutional relationships;\nand appropriate handling of proprietary or other confidential\ninformation; will go a long way towards addressing the Committee's\nconcerns. Providing clear, specific guidance will help prevent\ninadvertent missteps by well-intentioned scientists and institutions,\nand may help limit increased scrutiny to those individuals and areas of\nthe scientific or technological enterprise that pose a genuine threat.\nAAI strongly believes that the vast majority of NIH-funded scientists\nare conducting research in a fair and transparent manner, and are\nabiding by rules governing the safeguarding of data and confidential\nmanuscript or grant information. It is essential, therefore, that any\nsteps that Congress takes to address these few bad actors do no harm to\nthe ability of U.S. and foreign scientists to exchange ideas, work\ncollaboratively, or travel freely. The U.S. must continue to be an\nopen, welcoming place that will attract the most talented scientists\nand students from all over the world. If we lose those qualities, or if\nwe impose burdensome rules that deter U.S. or foreign scientists or\ninstitutions from pursuing international collaborations, then our\nadversaries--who strive to surpass us and from whom Congress rightly\nseeks to protect us--will have won.\n______\nFederation of American Scientists\n1112 16th Street, NW, Suite 400\nWashington, DC 20036\nThe Federation of American Scientists has engaged with the U.S.\nresearch community on the issue of foreign interference in federally\nfunded research and development. For U.S. leadership in science and\ntechnology, competitiveness, economic opportunity, and national\nsecurity, it is important that we do not diminish the U.S.' status as\nthe most desirable country for the best minds from around the world to\ncome to and do research, nor harm collaborations with expert research\ngroups abroad. We have collated stories from the U.S. research\ncommunity that are related to these concerns.\nThe personal experiences of U.S. researchers\nI was born and raised in Iran and came to the U.S. for graduate school\nin 2006. I received a Ph.D. from Princeton University and after a 5-\nyear long postdoctoral training at Rockefeller University in New York\nCity, I joined University of California, San Francisco in 2016. At\nUCSF, I am a member of the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer\nCenter and the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, and I\nlead a lab devoted to cancer research. I have received numerous awards\nfor my work in cancer research, most recently the AAAS Martin and Rose\nWachtel Cancer Research Award and the AACR Nextgen Stars in\nTransformative Cancer Research Award. Throughout my training, I have\nlearned from, worked with, and mentored many international students and\nscholars. Both my Ph.D. advisor and postdoc mentors were immigrants.\nFor many years I trained alongside brilliant scientists from Iran,\nGreece, Chile, Korea, China, and Germany. Even now, more than half of\nmy lab hail from countries other than the U.S. The contribution of\ninternational community to scientific progress is not limited to\nimmigrants and visiting scholars who relocate to the U.S. to both take\nadvantage of and contribute to our scientific enterprises. As the\nscientific gap between the U.S. and other countries closes, there are\nareas of research that are in fact led by research groups outside of\nthe U.S.\nModern science is multidisciplinary and sprawling. Therefore, we rely\non collaborative teams, often spanning multiple countries, to take on\nfundamental scientific questions. My lab collaborates with a number of\ncomputational groups outside of the U.S. and some of these works have\nalready been published. Grand scientific and biomedical challenges that\nface the humanity today are borderless, and we need every help we can\nget to tackle them. This is not to say that we should not safeguard our\nnational interests and strive to maintain our edge in modern\ntechnologies, but the reality is that scientific progress, for the most\npart, has no immediate impact on technology. Rather, it is a form of\ninvestment for our future and those of our children for generations to\ncome. Strict rules and policies that seek to limit and regulate\nacademic interactions and collaborations will surely impede scientific\nprogress and the policy makers should think hard about such\nramifications. Moreover, uneven implementation of restrictive policies\nwill result in the exclusion of scientists and academics from specific\nbackgrounds or countries. This is simply not acceptable. We have no\ncontrol over our countries of birth and there is no evidence that the\nuse of nationality for risk stratification is an effective solution.\nScientists everywhere are over-worked and underpaid, but they choose to\ndevote their lives for the betterment of humanity. Safeguarding the\nworld-wide collaborative environment where scientists can share ideas\nand work as teams towards the common good is crucial for our long term\nsurvival.\n-  Dr. Hani Goodarzi, Assistant Professor, Department of\nBiochemistry and Biophysics, UC San Francisco\nSince joining our faculty just a few years ago, Hani Goodarzi has\nbecome a driving creative force within UCSF, helping to both pushing\nthe boundaries of discovery and its translation into new insights into\ncancer. If we want to develop a new generation of scientific insight\nand cures for deadly diseases, we need a new generation of\ngroundbreaking scientists, regardless of where they might have been\nborn. True breakthroughs in science are rare, and we need to assemble\nthe best team of bright, young scientists we can, scientists just like\nDr. Goodarzi.\n-  Dr. Jeremy Reiter, Professor and Chair, Department of\nBiochemistry and Biophysics, UC San Francisco\nI grew up in China and received my training there. After receiving my\nPh.D. degree and completing several years of postdoctoral training in\nvarious laboratories around the world, I came to the U.S. in 1999. I\nworked for six years at Harvard Medical School (HMS) in Boston as a\nresearch associate and an Instructor with Professor Thomas Walz, who\nhimself came to HMS from Switzerland. Together, we established a cryo-\nelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) facility to study the structures of\nproteins with important biological functions. I was recruited to the\nUniversity of California San Francisco (UCSF) in 2006 as a tenure track\nfaculty member in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics. My\nlaboratory at UCSF focuses on methodological developments of single\nparticle cryo-EM and structural studies of many challenging biological\nmacromolecules that play important biological and pharmacological roles\nin health and diseases. Together with my colleagues at UCSF, our work\nfacilitated some major technological breakthroughs in structural\nbiology. I became an Investigator of Howard Hughes Medical Institute\n(HHMI) in 2015, and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and\nSciences in 2019.\nThroughout my scientific career, I have worked in different countries\nand worked with scientists from many more countries. Here at UCSF, some\nof our best trainees are international students and scholars. Just to\nname a few examples: Dr. Xueming Li developed an algorithm to correct\nthe image blurring caused by a high-energy electron beam, a critical\ntechnological progress that enables us to determine protein atomic\nstructure by single particle cryo-EM. Ors. Maofu Liao and Erhu Cao\ndetermined the first atomic structure of a membrane protein by using\nsingle particle cryo-EM, work that triggered the so-called ``resolution\nrevolution'' in structural biology that is being driven by this new\ntype of cryo-EM. The above three were postdoctoral fellows at UCSF who\ncame from China originally. They are now faculty members at Tsinghua\nUniversity (Xueming Li), Harvard Medical School (Maofu Liao) and\nUniversity of Utah (Erhu Cao), respectively. During their time at UCSF,\neach made important contributions to scientific discoveries and\ntechnological developments in our research field, increasing our\nuniversity's attractiveness for more such talent from around the world.\nAnd as is normal for such postdocs, they are continuing their\nscientific careers at other institutions.\nThe U.S. has been a world model for scientific openness and\ninternational collaboration. For that reason, this nation has attracted\nlarge numbers of the most talented and gifted young trainees from\naround the world. Here, they not only receive training, but also to\ncontribute in major ways to scientific discoveries and technological\ndevelopments. Many tens of thousands, like me, have chosen to remain in\nthe U.S. The few examples that I mention here demonstrate the\nimportance of continuing such openness and international collaborations\nfor the future vitality of U.S. science.\n-  Dr. Yifan Cheng, Professor, UC San Francisco Department of\nBiochemistry and Biophysics; Investigator, Howard Hughes\nMedical Institute\nYifan Cheng is a major reason why I moved my lab to UCSF and why UCSF\nis a world-leading center for structural biology. Yifan is a world-\nleading expert in\natomic-resolution electron microscopy. Among his many accomplishments,\nDr. Cheng led the effort to apply electron microscopy to determine the\nstructure of the TRP-family of ion channels, with the structure of\nTRPV1 (Nature, 2013) being the first near-atomic resolution structure\nof a transmembrane ion channel determined by single particle cryoEM.\nYifan also led the effort that led to the structure of TRPV1 and other\nTRP-family channels in lipid nanodiscs, a hugely important step forward\nin studying these nanoscopic machines in their near-native state\nembedded in a lipid bilayer. Both of these landmark accomplishments\nwere facilitated by Yifan's work, together with UCSF professor David\nAgard, on the use of direct electron detectors to improve the\ninformation content of cryo-electron micrographs. Yifan Cheng's work\nchanged the way we study membrane protein structure and function, and\nthe methods his lab developed are now used throughout the world.\n-  Dr. Adam Frost, Associate Professor, UC San Francisco\nBiochemistry and Biophysics\nSome examples from our (University of Iowa) faculty born outside the\nU.S., all with histories of NIH funding:\nAzeez Butali, born in Nigeria: Has collected DNA samples across\nAfrica with a focus on genes associated with cleft lip and palate.\nLong-term intent for the African and U.S. samples: develop genetic\ninterventions for facial anomalies.

Over the past 20 years, my research\nefforts as a faculty member and chief scientific officer (CSO) have\nbrought in $20 million in grant money to the state of Iowa. I was the\nprincipal investigator or company CSO responsible for bringing in $12\nmillion. For the remainder, I contributed as a co-principal\ninvestigator. Most of this money has moved into the Iowa economy\nthrough wages and taxes. I hope to contribute a lot more to the economy\nas developments in my company move into the market.\n-  Dr. Marit Nilsen-Hamilton, Professor, Iowa State University\nI emigrated to the U.S. 11 years ago as a postdoctoral fellow and have\nsince made significant contributions to its research enterprise and\neducational system. I am currently an associate professor and director\nof a laboratory at an R1 university. I have published over 40 peer-\nreviewed articles and trained more than 35 individuals from\nundergraduate students to postdoctoral fellows who have gone on to\nresearch and industry careers. I have received several awards for my\nscience outreach, service, promotion of diversity, and scientific\nachievements. I have collaborated with colleagues around the world in\nour common efforts to reduce mortality resulting from air pollution\nexposures. I have also represented the U.S. as a young science leader\nin international gatherings.\n-  Dr. Patricia Silveyra, Associate Professor and Biobehavioral\nLaboratory Director, The University of North Carolina at Chapel\nHill\nI am a Hispanic immigrant, moved to the United States in 1982. In 1989\nI received a Ph.D. in Statistics and Animal Breeding, and joined the\nfaculty in Statistics at Iowa State University in 1990. Since then, I\nhave mentored the doctoral work of 24 students (at least half of them,\nAmerican), taught class for thousands of other students, attracted\napproximately $30 million in sponsored research funding to Iowa, was\nelected member of the National Academy of Medicine, and was honored\nwith fellowships from most major statistical organizations in the U.S.\nand abroad. Without foreign-born researchers, the entire system of\nhigher education in the United States would collapse in a minute.\n-  Dr. Alicia Carriquiry, President's Chair in Statistics and\nDistinguished Professor, Iowa State University; Member,\nNational Academy of Medicine\nI came to the U.S. in 1982 from New Zealand after obtaining my Ph.D. in\nBiochemistry from Massey University. I came for additional training in\nthe sciences, and in 1988 I was hired to the faculty of Iowa State\nUniversity. I rose through the ranks and am currently the Frances M.\nCraig Professor of Biochemistry at Iowa State University. I became a\nU.S. citizen and my research program has been continuously funded since\n1988 by the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Energy,\nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture, or the National Institutes of\nHealth. Currently I am serving at the National Science Foundation, as a\nDivision Director in the Biological Sciences Directorate. In the past\n30 years I have trained and mentored over 50 Ph.D. and MSc graduates,\nwho have matriculated from Iowa State University. And through this body\nof work, my group has published over 130 peer-reviewed research\nmanuscripts. During this period, I have had the pleasure of\ncollaborating with colleagues from Japan, Korea, France, the United\nKingdom, India, New Zealand, and Australia.\n-  Dr. Basil Nikolau, Frances M. Craig Professor of\nBiochemistry, Iowa State University\nI was born in Central America and came to the USA for college. I\nreceived a BA from Harvard and a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley. I've been at\nRice University for the last 10 years and have supervised 6 doctoral\nstudents, all of whom are U.S. citizens, as well as 8 post-doctoral\nscholars, 6 of whom are U.S. citizens. Several of these students and\npost-docs have continued in academia, and are training the next\ngeneration of STEM students. Others have moved into important\nindustrial positions (data science, medical fields). While my research\nhas been largely theoretical, it has found application in the\nconstruction of cloud storage systems. I am incredibly grateful for the\nopportunities I have been afforded in the USA, and expect to continue\nto contribute to the development of its STEM workforce.\n-  Dr. Anthony Varilly-Alvarado, Professor of Mathematics, Rice\nUniversity\nI moved to Iowa in 2001 from Norway, but I had taught at the University\nof Maine and received my Doctor of Natural Sciences degree from the ETH\nZurich in Switzerland. I had moved to Zurich from Italy, my home\ncountry, to study geology. I spent the last 35 years of my life working\nwith people from all over the world, and my research has been made\nstronger and richer by my multicultural background and what I learned\nfrom the many people I have worked with. I have educated thousands of\nIowa and U.S. students at Iowa State University, and taught them about\nour planet, how it works, and how humankind interacts with it and\ndepends on it. I strive to show them how their choices and decisions\nimpact the rest of the world, and share with them the astonishing\nbeauty and power of the planet we live on.\nMy professional experience and successful career in science and\neducation research are an example of the benefits of living and working\nin a multicultural and diverse society, and am grateful for the\nopportunities to work with colleagues in Europe and elsewhere that I\nhad while a faculty member at Iowa State University.\n-  Dr. Cinzia Cervato, Morrill Professor, Iowa State University\nNanshu Lu (originally from China; graduated from Harvard; now professor\nof biomedical engineering at University of Texas-Austin), http://\nwww.nafsa.org/Policy_and_Advocacy/What_We_Stand_For/\nWelcoming_International_Students/Meet_\nInternational_Students/Nanshu_Lu/.\nAnirban Sen Gupta (originally from India; graduated from University of\nAkron; now professor in biomedical engineering at Case Western Reserve\nUniversity), http://www.nafsa.org/Policy_and_Advocacy/\nWhat_We_Stand_For/Welcoming_Internation\nal_Students/Meet_International_Students/Anirban_Sen_Gupta/.\nYu Takahashi (originally from Japan; graduate of Embry-Riddle\nAeronautical University and University of Colorado Boulder; now a\nnavigation engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory working on the\nDawn, Juno, and OSIRIS-REx missions), http://www.nafsa.org/\nPolicy_and_Advocacy/What_We_Stand_For/Welcoming_Inter\nnational_Students/Meet_International_Students/Yu_Takahashi/.\nI have collaborations with several groups around the world. Over the\nyears this has included labs located in Japan, Spain and Korea, as well\nas 3 in Germany, 3 in England, and 10 in China. This has provided\ncomplimentary expertise to the biochemical studies that are the\nexpertise of my own group, and allowed us to not only remain\ncompetitive, but also develop new areas of research, with important\nimplications for not only agriculture, but health (medicinal natural\nproducts) as well.\n-  Dr. Reuben Peters, Professor, Iowa State University\nNon-U.S. citizens and international collaborations are essential to\ninnovation and progress within the U.S. scientific community. I am a\nPh.D. candidate in biomedical engineering at the University of\nVirginia. I work with numerous non-U.S. citizens who contribute greatly\nto the work that I do. A postdoctoral researcher in our lab is a\ncitizen of Iran and is working here on a visa. He completed his Ph.D.\nat Tulane University and is now working as a postdoctoral researcher at\nUVA. He is pursuing novel research to identify more effective\ntreatments for diabetes. Additionally, our lab collaborates with a\ncompany based in Sweden that allows us to develop and test a novel drug\nto accelerate diabetic wound healing. Our research and the future of\nmedical therapies would suffer tremendously without the benefit of\ninternational talent and collaboration.\n-  Ms. Michaela Rikard, Ph.D. Candidate in Biomedical\nEngineering, University of Virginia\nAbout 15 years ago, the National Science Foundation offered a program\ncalled the Materials World Network, which was a program to initiate and\ndevelop international collaborations. Some of my research efforts in\nmagnetic materials were supported through this program, in an effective\ncollaboration with a group in Germany at the RWTH-Aachen, one of the\npremier universities in Germany. The scientific effort led to the\ndiscovery of new magnets along with chemical interpretations of how\ntheir structures and properties are related. A part of the project\nsupported graduate student exchange between our groups. During these\nexchanges, students learned new techniques not available at their\nrespective home institution as well as how academic life in the other\nlocation compared with their own. As a result, some important\nfundamental science about magnetic solids emerged from this\ncollaborative research and many of the student participants are now\nfilling faculty positions across the U.S. The experiences for both\ngroups were outstanding and led to further interactions between us\nafter the program ended. I feel that these experiences for our students\nwere a vital part of their subsequent professional success because\nscience has always been an international effort, relying on discussion\nand collaboration among people with very different perspectives and\ngoals.\n-  Dr. Gordon Miller, University Professor of Chemistry, Iowa\nState University\nI study machine learning algorithms and how they help us understand\nsocial media data. As part of this work, I traveled to North Korea in\n2015 and 2016 to teach North Korean citizens how to work with social\nmedia data. I taught classes at the Pyongyang University of Science and\nTechnology (PUST), and had North Korean students collaborating with\nU.S. citizens to make the first North Korean contributions to open\nsource software. This was a great thing for those students personally,\nbut also for the relationship between our two countries. This gave the\nNorth Korean students a chance to better understand American culture\nfirst hand, and gave Americans like me a first-hand understanding of\nthe real North Korea. Unfortunately, recent federal policy with North\nKorea has prevented me from visiting North Korea to teach at PUST. This\nmeans that these North Korean students are no longer getting to learn\nfirsthand about American culture, and American citizens no longer get\nto learn about North Korea. Rather than limiting our academic exchange\nprograms, I believe we should be extending them.\n-  Dr. Mike Izbicki, Assistant Professor, Claremont McKenna\nCollege\nAbout 20 years ago, an interdisciplinary research group at Iowa State\nUniversity developed a new way to analyze and design large electric\npower systems. The new design incorporates nonlinear elements into the\nformerly linear world of power systems design using a mathematical\ntheory known as ``normal forms.'' This approach was approved by the\nIEEE about 10 years ago, and is now being used by many U.S. utilities.\nIt makes stressed systems more stable and reliable and thus supports\nimportant safety considerations for our national infrastructure. At\nthis moment, researchers are incorporating statistical elements into\nthis design model to account for alternative sources of generation,\nsuch as sun or wind, which are not always available.\nKey investigators on these projects were engineers born in India,\nEgypt, and Chile, with substantial support from German mathematicians.\nIEEE stands for the U.S. Institute of Electrical and Electronics\nEngineers. It is the world's largest technical professional\norganization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of\nhumanity, with U.S. headquarters and a global presence of seven\ninternational offices.\n-  Dr. Wolfgang Kliemann, Professor of Mathematics, Iowa State\nUniversity\nI have worked with many foreign-born researchers. In every case they\nwere highly skilled, imaginative and essential to the success of my\nprojects. Talent is agnostic to geopolitical boundaries and I believe\nthe U.S. should welcome with open arms top researchers and engineers\nfrom any country.\n-  Dr. Matthew Gruner, Postdoctoral Fellow, UC San Francisco\nI am an American scientist with a basic research background, who\nvolunteers with grassroots science policy groups, and is now a AAAS S&T\nPolicy Fellow. In all these pursuits I have witnessed how scientific\nresearch hinges upon the principles of open science--the public and\ntransparent sharing of knowledge in collaboration with any scientist\nregardless of nationality. My Ph.D. research was in lab with a majority\nof international researchers, coming from France, India, China, and\nJapan. Their presence contributed novel ways of thinking, different\ncultures and experiences in life, and new ways to approach challenging\nscientific obstacles. The participation of the international research\ncommunity within the American research ecosystem is vital for the\ncontinued preeminence of our country's research enterprise. I recognize\nthe concern over the welfare and security of our country, and the risks\ninvolved in the unwanted dissemination of technology. But this is a\nbalancing act, not a decisive unilateral action. American research\nthrives with the open exchange of ideas and unhindered communication.\n-  Dr. Avital Percher, National Science Policy Network\n(opinions are his own)\nThis information is to give background information about the\nprofessoriate in the mathematical sciences.

For example, it is estimated that \\2/3\\ of current biomedical\npostdocs in the United States are foreign-born.\\1\\ Using U.S. Census\ndata, we found that by 2014, 52% of the Ph.D.-holding U.S. biomedical\nworkforce was composed of foreign-born workers, having increased\ndramatically from only 22% in 1990.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Postdoctoral Researchers--Facts, Trends, and Gaps, NIH Office\nof Extramural Research, https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2012/06/29/\npostdoctoral-researchers-facts-trends-and-qaps/.\n\\2\\ ``The New Face of U.S. Science,'' Nature, https://\nwww.nature.com/news/the-new-face-of-us-science-1.21229 (working paper:\nhttp://sjscience.org/article?id=570).\n[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nResearch in the U.S. is highly dependent on the labor of foreign-born\nresearchers. Studies have shown that foreign-born researchers are\nhighly productive and increase the scientific output of the U.S.,\nproducing more publications than their domestic counterparts.\\3\\ The\nimportance of foreign-born researchers to the U.S. economy was also\nrecently demonstrated in an open letter signed by 150 biotech leaders\nciting concerns about immigration policy in 2017.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\3\\ ``Exceptional contributions to U.S. science by the foreign-born\nand foreign-educated,'' Population Research and Policy Review, https://\nlink.sprinqer.com/article/10.1023/A:1010682017950.\n\\4\\ ``U.S. immigration order strikes against biotech,'' http://\nblogs.nature.com/tradesecrets/2017/02/07/us-immigration-order-strikes-\naqainst-biotech.\nIt is therefore in the national interest to ensure that there is not a\nloss of foreign talent by overly burdening the research enterprise with\narduous vetting processes, by appropriately reacting to, and\npreventing, the efforts a minority involved in foreign interference.\nHowever, we recognize that there are opportunities to strengthen\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\noversight.\nCurrent Rhetoric and Plans for Increased Vetting May Do More Harm to\nthe U.S. Than Good\nAs discussed in the NIH's Foreign Influences Working Group report \\5\\\nand a recent study,\\6\\ countries reap most benefit from investment by\nfunding the best science, regardless of where it takes place, or who\nperforms it, and ensuring that their domestically based scientists are\ninvolved.

Recent changes in immigration\npolicy already have the potential to dissuade foreign-born researchers,\nsuch as those with spouses, from carrying out study or research in the\nU.S.\nThe Committee may wish to consider that the current reaction to threats\nfrom foreign influences, the swift reaction of the intelligence\ncommunity, and the failure of agencies to issue clear guidance to\ninstitutions, thus causing confusion and panic among the research\ncommunity, may be playing exactly into the strategy of foreign actors\nkeen to absorb the fruits of U.S. taxpayer-funded research.\nBelow we wish to particularly highlight that, while the biomedical\nresearch enterprise is particularly dependent on foreign labor, a lack\nof attention to populations such as the postdoctoral research community\nis failing to capitalize on the potential brain gain from foreign-born\nresearchers, and may even provide an opportunity for exploitation from\nforeign influences.\nOpacity in the Biomedical NIH-Funded Training Enterprise\nDespite the fact that \\2/3\\ of the NIH's extramural and intramural\nworkforces are\nforeign-born, it is unclear what the return is on the NIH's investment\nin training foreign-born researchers, as (in the NIH's own words) ``we\ndo not collect much information about foreign-trained Ph.D.s who come\nto the U.S. to do a postdoc, and we have no idea how long they stay or\nhow many leave after their training.''\\7\\ It is clearly not appropriate\nfor a federal agency to be unable to provide such basic data about\ntaxpayer-funded researchers, not least when possible foreign influences\nare under consideration.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\7\\ Postdoctoral Researchers--Facts, Trends, and Gaps, NIH Office\nof Extramural Research, https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2012/06/29/\npostdoctoral-researchers-facts-trends-and-gaps/.\nWith little attention to the training of foreign-born scientists, and\nsubsequent efforts to benefit from the ``brain gain'' of retaining the\nbest foreign-born talent, the NIH are missing an opportunity to ensure\nlong-term investment in the best science. It is also possible that by\npaying little to no attention to the workforce they support,\nparticularly postdoctoral researchers, NIH is providing an opportunity\nfor foreign interference through generating opacity in the biomedical\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nworkforce.\nAs a result of the unavailability of NIH training support, the majority\nof foreign-born researchers are funded from research project grants,\nwhich currently provide no assessment of training nor evaluation of\nscientific ability. It is therefore not only very difficult to identify\ntalented, foreign-born investigators to be retained in the U.S.; it\nalso difficult to discern whether labs are being staffed by cheaper\nforeign labor to the detriment of domestically trained talent.\nBy placing foreign researchers at a disadvantage relative to their\ndomestic counterparts, the U.S., which currently leads in training the\nworld's scientists, may face more fierce competition in coming years\nfor the world's best talent. In addition, by placing their own\nresearchers at a disadvantage in competing against a cheaper labor\nforce for positions in the U.S., we may be dissuading homegrown talent\nfrom entering the NIH workforce.\nNIH has claimed that it is unable to support foreign researchers on\ntraining and fellowship mechanisms--which could allow oversight into\nresearch activities of\nforeign-born researchers while ensuring the potential brain gain is\ndeveloped to the benefit of the research enterprise--due to legal\nbarriers. Requests to NIH, including to their legal counsel, have not\nresulted in a clarification of what these ``legal barriers'' are, or\nwhether they exist. The existence of legal barriers is contradicted by\nthe existence of mechanisms to support foreign-born talent, such as the\nNCI- and NIDDK-specific Predoctoral to Postdoctoral Fellow Transition\nAward (F99/KOO) and the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/ROO).\nThese mechanisms facilitate transitions to independence into the\npostdoctoral experience, and into an independent faculty position,\nrespectively. Foreign postdocs compete with U.S. citizens and permanent\nresidents in application for these awards.\nSummary\nUltimately, we urge the Senate Finance Committee to consider that there\nshould be more support for the foreign-born research population, not\nless. It is clearly in the interests of foreign states to cause the\nUnited States to drive out foreign-born talent, which they can then\nabsorb. The Committee may consider that the current reaction to threats\nfrom foreign influences and the swift reaction of the intelligence\ncommunity may be playing exactly into the strategy of foreign actors\nkeen to absorb the fruits of U.S. taxpayer-funded research.\nWe thank the U.S. Senate Finance Committee for their work and interest\nin the role of foreign researchers in the U.S.\n[all]",

John Barrasso\n(chairman of the committee) presiding.\nPresent: Senators Barrasso, Carper, Cramer, Braun, Rounds,\nSullivan, Ernst, Cardin, Whitehouse, Markey, Van Hollen.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BARRASSO,\nU.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WYOMING\nSenator Barrasso. Good morning. I call this hearing to\norder.\nToday we will consider the nomination of Rob Wallace to be\nAssistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife, and Parks at the\nDepartment of the Interior. Once confirmed, he will oversee the\nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service.\nHis confirmation will be especially important, as neither of\nthese agencies have Senate-confirmed leadership at this time.\nHe will play a central role in managing fish and wildlife for\nthe American public. That includes combatting invasive species,\nrecovering endangered species, protecting migratory birds,\nrestoring fisheries, and conserving and enhancing wildlife\nhabitat.\nI have known Rob Wallace for over 35 years. Without\nquestion, Rob is the right person for this job. Throughout his\nlong and distinguished career, Rob has struck the proper\nbalance between wildlife conservation, habitat management, and\nthe use of our public lands. Rob's experience and leadership in\nWyoming and in our Nation's capital are ideally suited for this\ncritically important position.\nThroughout his 45-year career, Rob has served in a variety\nof jobs that directly relate to the two Federal agencies that\nhe is being nominated to oversee. Rob began his career as a\nseasonal park ranger in Grand Teton National Park. Since then,\nRob has served as Assistant Director of the National Park\nService, as Chief of Staff for Wyoming Senator Malcolm Wallop,\nas Staff Director of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural\nResources Committee, as Chief of Staff for Wyoming Governor Jim\nGeringer, and as manager of U.S. Government Relations for GE\nEnergy.\nRob currently serves as President of the Upper Green River\nConservancy, the Nation's first cooperative conservation bank.\nRob co-founded the Upper Green River Conservancy to protect\ncore sage grouse habitat in the ecologically and energy-rich\nupper Green River Watershed in Southwest Wyoming. He built an\ninnovative partnership of ranchers, conservation groups, energy\ncompanies, investors and other stakeholders.\nRob is also a founding member of the board of the Grand\nTeton National Park Foundation, which promotes the park's\ncultural, historic and natural resources. He is a member of the\nboard of the Jackson Hole Land Trust, which protects open\nspaces, wildlife habitat, and working lands across northwest\nWyoming.\nIn addition, Rob serves as a member of the University of\nWyoming's Energy Resources Council. The Council sets priorities\nfor energy-related academics, research and outreach. He has\nalso served on the boards of numerous organizations dedicated\nto conserving wildlife and enhancing our national parks.\nWith credentials like these, it is no surprise that\nstakeholders from across the political spectrum have\nenthusiastically endorsed Rob's nomination. Dan Ashe, the\nformer Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service during\nthe Obama administration, and now the President and now the\nPresident of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, wrote, ``I\nhave a good context for what creates success in this important\nand challenging position: a passion for the mission of the U.S.\nFish and Wildlife Service, and the National Park Service.'' He\ngoes on to say, ``An appreciation and admiration for the people\nwho do the work, a penchant for listening, and a dedication to\ninclusive problem-solving.'' He concludes by saying, ``In my\nview, Rob displays all of these crucial characteristics.''\nRichie Jones, the State Director for the Nature Conservancy\nin Delaware, also endorsed Rob's nomination. He has also\nreceived the support of over 40 environmental, conservation,\nand recreational organizations, including the National Parks\nConservation Association, the National Wildlife Refuge\nAssociation, the Public Lands Council, Ducks Unlimited,\nAmerican Sportfishing Association, congressional Sportsmen\nFoundation, and the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation\nPartnership.\nConfirming Rob is important to the work of this committee.\nThe Environment and Public Works Committee has jurisdiction\nover fish and wildlife policy, including the U.S. Fish and\nWildlife Service. Earlier this year, Congress enacted the\nWildlife Innovation and Longevity Driver Act, also known as the\nWILD Act. We did so to combat invasive species, to prevent\nwildlife poaching and trafficking, to promote wildlife\nconservation and to protect endangered species.\nSo I look forward to working with Rob to implement the WILD\nAct. I am in the process of developing legislation to modernize\nthe Endangered Species Act. I continue to engage with State\nfish and wildlife agencies, environmental groups, conservation\norganizations, ranchers, farmers, energy producers, and others\nfrom across the political spectrum. I hope to gain their\nsupport and ultimately the support of a bipartisan group of\nSenators for a bill that modernizes the Endangered Species Act\nso it works better for species and for people.\nRob demonstrated to the Upper Green River Conservancy that\nit is possible to build such a coalition, focused on solving\nthe problems of the Endangered Species Act. So I look forward\nto working with him on modernizing this important law.\nRob Wallace is an outstanding choice for the position of\nAssistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife, and Parks. I look\nforward to moving his nomination expeditiously through the\nconfirmation process.\nI will now turn to Ranking Member Carper for his opening\nstatement.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. THOMAS R. CARPER,\nU.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF DELAWARE\nSenator Carper. Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr.\nWallace, welcome. I want to welcome you and your daughters this\nmorning.\nAlso, I would like to welcome Senator Mike Enzi, one of our\nfavorite colleagues. I listened to the Chairman's opening\nstatement, it sounds like you have his support, and Mike Enzi's\nsupport, Dan Ashe's support, Richie Jones' support from\nDelaware, a whole host, like a Who's Who of organizations here\nthat represent and look after the fish and wildlife, endangered\nspecies and habitat protection, conservation. This is one of\nthose deals where you may just want to ask somebody to make a\nmotion, and we just vote.\nSenator Barrasso. So moved.\n[Laughter.]\nSenator Carper. We can all take an early lunch.\nSeriously, we appreciate your willingness to do this. It is\nalways great to have Mike Enzi in the room, and we appreciate\nyour family being here, too. We appreciate your willingness to\nserve in this role as Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife\nand Parks. I think it has to be a great job. Of all the jobs\nyou could have, this has to be one of the best.\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park\nService are two agencies that, as we know, play critical roles\nin managing and protecting our Nation's most treasured natural\nresources and public lands. I am sure you will agree, given\nyour experience as a park ranger, as a youngster, and as\nsomeone who has lived a life that I think you can be proud of.\nIn Delaware, we are extremely proud of our two national\nwildlife refuges, and one of the Country's newest national\nparks, the First State National Historical Park. Our refuges\nare home to threatened and endangered species, and people from\nall over the world travel to Delaware to visit these refuges,\nas well as our national park.\nOverseeing these agencies and beloved public lands is no\nsmall task, but one that you seem prepared for, and I believe\nare passionate about. I especially appreciate the statement in\nyour testimony, and this is a quote from you, ``Bipartisan\nsolutions are always the lasting ones. Those are words of\nwisdom.''\nI could not agree more. And I hope that we will be able to\ncount on you to bring that balanced approach to the\nAdministration's Department of the Interior.\nUnfortunately, having said that, unfortunately, the\nDepartment and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in particular\nhave taken actions in the last couple of years that could\njeopardize our Nation's wildlife without bipartisan support\nfrom Members of Congress. Specifically, the Administration has\nproposed regulation that could dramatically alter\nimplementation of the Endangered Species Act, one of our\nNation's most popular and effective environmental laws. These\nregulations could undermine the science that is supposed to\ndrive species protection decisions.\nThis Administration has also adopted an unprecedented legal\nopinion relative to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, a stance\nthat former top Fish and Wildlife Service officials from both\nRepublican and Democratic administrations have vehemently\nopposed. What is more, the Trump Administration has reassigned\ndozens of Department of Interior senior executive service\nemployees without good reasons, which is reportedly creating a\nculture of fear within the Department. Surpassing the expertise\nof career public servants is an injustice to natural resources\nthat the Department is tasked with managing.\nAll of these actions, along with a number of others, are\ndeeply concerning. Mr. Wallace, I would just say, as this\ncommittee considers your nomination, I hope you will heed these\nconcerns and clearly convey a willingness to moderate some of\nthese trouble actions. I also hope that we can work together to\nfind bipartisan opportunities that support both solid science\nand conservation.\nI believe that tackling climate change is one such\nopportunity. And due to climate change, our treasured national\nparks and refuges in the west are increasingly beset by\ncatastrophic fires. Worsening storms are damaging our coastal\nparks and refuges.\nRecently, the National Parks Conservation Association found\nthat out of 417 parks surveyed, 96 percent faced significant\nair quality problems. You will learn more about how you will\nwork to address these challenges. I believe it is now more\nimportant than ever that we work together to make sure our\nparks and our refuges are more resilient to climate change so\nthat Americans may have the opportunity to visit these places\nfor generations to come.\nMr. Wallace, you also possess a great deal of expertise in\nhabitat conservation and mitigation. You and I have discussed\nyour work in both Wyoming and in Delaware on projects that mean\na great deal to each of us and to this committee. Clearly, you\nunderstand the importance of mitigating negative impacts on our\nenvironment. I believe that understanding provides another\ngreat opportunity for you to lead within the Department of the\nInterior.\nSo we look forward to hearing how you will utilize this\nexpertise as Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and\nParks if confirmed. Right now, we need qualified leaders who\nare committed to safeguarding our natural resources. I feel\nconfident that you are up to that challenge.\nThank you again for joining us. Again, welcome to your\nfamily. We look forward to hearing your testimony and to the\nconversation that will follow your testimony. Thank you.\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you, Senator Carper.\nSeeing that Senator Enzi is here, I think if there is any\nSenator that is mentioned in this committee, who is not a\nmember of this committee, the No. 1 person on that list would\nbe Mike Enzi, as you talk about his 80-20 rule, a good way to\nget things done legislatively and in a bipartisan way and\nworking for the way.\nSenator Carper. Absolutely. I was in an Aspen Institute\nseminar in Prague last week, and we focused on U.S. relations\nwith China, U.S. relations with Russia. We talked about Mike\nEnzi and the 80-20 rule. So you are all over the charts and all\nover the map.\nSenator Barrasso. With that, let me welcome to the Senate\nCommittee on Environment and Public Works Senator Mike Enzi,\nSenior Senator for Wyoming, who will do the introduction.\nSenator Enzi, thanks so much for joining us today.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE ENZI,\nU.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WYOMING\nSenator Enzi. Mr. Chairman. Chairman Barrasso and Ranking\nMember Carper, it is my privilege to introduce Rob Wallace, who\nis testifying in front of your committee today on his\nnomination to serve as Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife,\nand Parks at the Department of Interior.\nI have known Rob for many years, probably most of his life.\nI don't think there could be a better choice to fill the\nposition. I am going to repeat some of the things that Chairman\nBarrasso said. I am a retailer, and I know that when you run an\nad the first time, hardly anybody gets it. If you run it again,\na few more do. And I would be willing to run this several times\nif it would help on the nomination.\nRob was born and raised in Wyoming, where he quickly\nlearned the important role that the Department of Interior\nplays in the upkeep of our State's natural beauty. In fact,\nRob's first job after college was with the National Park\nService. He served as a seasonal ranger in Grand Teton National\nPark. For 5 years, Rob helped with the preservation and\nmaintenance of one of our Nation's finest parks.\nHis passion for our Nation's public lands sent him here to\nWashington, where he handled energy and environment issues for\nformer Wyoming Senator Malcolm Wallop, and before leaving\nCapitol Hill, he served as staff director of the Energy and\nNatural Resources Committee. He returned to Sheridan and the\nincredible Big Horn Mountains, until Rob once again came back\nto Washington, where he served as Assistant Director for the\nNational Park Service for congressional and Legislative\nAffairs.\nDuring this time, he supervised the Reagan administration's\nlegislative agenda for national parks, which included\nreadjusting visitor entrance fees, providing resources to fight\nthe 1988 forest fires, and adding several new units to the\nnational park system. In 1989, Rob became Senator Wallop's\nChief of Staff, before heading back to the Senate Energy and\nNatural Resources Committee in 1991, to again serve as staff\ndirector.\nI first met Rob in 1995, when he served as Chief of Staff\nto the Wyoming Governor Jim Geringer, and I was in the State\nlegislature. These days, Rob is still involved in Wyoming and\nthe management of our public lands. Rob serves as the president\nof the Upper Green River Conservancy. Now, that is a sage\ngrouse habitat bank that partners with ranchers, energy\ncompanies and conservation groups that work together to protect\ncritical sage grouse habitat.\nRob's career and character reflect a man willing to step up\nand serve his community and Country. His years of experience at\nInterior and in the halls of Congress have well suited him to\nthis new chapter. I am pleased to introduce him to you today,\nand I hope you will give his nomination full and fair\nconsideration.\n[The prepared statement of Senator Enzi follows:]\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you for joining us, Senator Enzi.\nWe will have another opportunity tomorrow to introduce Rob,\nbecause this is one of those positions that requires hearings\nin two committees, the Environment and Public Works Committee\nand the Energy Committee. So I look forward to seeing you again\ntomorrow morning in that committee as we introduce our friend,\nRob.\nYou are welcome to stay as long as you like. I know you\nhave a pressing schedule, but thanks for being with us and\njoining us today, Senator Enzi. Thank you.\nNow, I would like to welcome to our committee the nominee,\nRob Wallace, the nominee to be Assistant Secretary for Fish,\nWildlife, and Parks at the Department of the Interior. I want\nto remind you; your full written testimony will be made part of\nthe record. I look forward to hearing your testimony. I see\nsome of your family are here. I know many of your friends are\nhere. So, please, begin at your convenience.\nMr. Wallace. With the opening statement, Senator?\nSenator Barrasso. Please, and if you would like to\nintroduce your family, as well.\nSTATEMENT OF ROBERT WALLACE, NOMINATED TO BE ASSISTANT\nSECRETARY FOR FISH, WILDLIFE, AND PARKS, DEPARTMENT OF THE\nINTERIOR\nMr. Wallace. Absolutely. Chairman Barrasso, Ranking Member\nCarper and members of the committee, thank you for having me\nhere today. I am grateful to the President for nominating me to\nthis position, and thank Secretary Bernhardt for his support.\nI would also like to recognize family members who are here\nfrom Wyoming today, my wife, Celia, who is not only a\nremarkable partner but epitomizes the spirit of bipartisanship,\nhaving worked for both a Democrat and Republican member of the\nSenate years ago.\nMy oldest daughter, Morgan, just finished her sophomore\nyear in engineering at Wake Forest University, and is down from\nNew York where she is doing a renewable energy internship this\nsummer. And my youngest daughter, Ella, finished fourth grade\nand cannot be here today, because she is home studying for the\nSSAT in the event she has to apply for a new school next fall.\n[Laughter.]\nMr. Wallace. The four of us live a mile south of Grand\nTeton National Park and the Yellowstone ecosystem. Each year,\nour community hosts millions of visitors who come to play in\ntwo of the world's majestic national parks. They also marvel at\nthe abundant wildlife we all enjoy, thanks to wise management\nby State and Federal officials, and the National Elk Refuge,\nlocated in the heart of our valley.\nBut I know that simply living in a special place isn't\nsufficient justification to ask for your support to oversee two\nof the world's most celebrated agencies, the National Park\nService, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. So I would\nlike to explain a little bit about how I got here.\nMy journey began decades ago when I was hired right out of\ncollege as a seasonal park ranger in Grand Teton National Park.\nFor the next 5 years, I patrolled the park's rivers and lakes,\nworked with the mountain rescue team, enforced the game and\nfish regulations, performed law enforcement operations and\nemergency medical services on the park's highways, and traveled\non skis for days at a time across the Yellowstone and Grand\nTeton back country. And in the fall, if my park work ended\nearly, I worked at an elk hunting camp at a nearby national\nforest.\nBut it wasn't the daily adventures that had the most\nprofound effect on me. It was the political issues that swirled\naround every aspect of my job. Here was a place where\ndignitaries from around the world had traveled to attend the\nSecond World Conference on National Parks, and where the\nPresident of the United States came to relax. Up the road, in\nYellowstone, a raging debate was brewing over how to wean\ngrizzly bears off human garbage. And in the Tetons, vibrant\nconversation was underway about fire management, search and\nrescue, visitors' use, and resource protection.\nIn an effort to find a way to get more involved in these\nissues and others, I quit my park job and volunteered on a\ncampaign for Malcolm Wallop, who was running for the U.S.\nSenate from Wyoming. His race succeeded, and suddenly I had a\nfront-row seat to some of the most consequential energy,\nwildlife and natural resource issues in a generation.\nStarting my Senate career as an LA, following the EPW\ncommittee, and ending up as the minatory staff director of the\nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I was here when\nCongress tackled the Alaska Lands legislation, a crippling oil\nembargo, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, the Exxon\nValdez oil spill, the restructuring of the U.S. electricity\nindustry, controversial endangered species issues, such as the\nspotted owl and the snail darter, and much more.\nI also broadened my understanding of new park\nauthorizations, fee legislation, concession oversight and the\nimportance of timely communications with Congress, while\nheading the Park Service's office of congressional Relations.\nLater, as chief of staff to the Governor of Wyoming, I was in\nthe middle of wolf reintroduction in Yellowstone.\nI ended my time in Washington working for GE, where my\nprimary responsibility was leading a policy team that focused\non the deployment of clean energy technologies in the United\nStates and around the world. Over the years, I also became a\nchampion of public-private partnerships, through serving on\nboards of several natural resources organizations, whose\nmissions were to help fund infrastructure projects, augment\nwildlife research budgets, and provide opportunities for young\npeople to work and learn on our public lands. Today, I work on\nthe frontiers of the Endangered Species Act in southwestern\nWyoming, bringing ranchers, regulators, conservationists, and\nindustry leaders together to protect large-scale habitats of\nthe greater sage grouse, while removing barriers to multiple\nuse.\nAlong the way, I have learned so much, especially that no\none ever wins by winning everything, that bipartisan solutions\nare always the lasting solutions, and that the key success to\nmanagement is recruiting good people and trusting them to do\ntheir jobs.\nFinally, if confirmed, I want to stress my commitment to\nwork constructively with Congress on behalf of our parks,\nrefuges, fish, and wildlife. If well-meaning people engage in\ngood faith and communicate effectively, the benefit to these\nnational treasures can be unlimited.\nI thank you, and I look forward to your questions.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Wallace follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nSenator Barrasso. Thanks so much for your testimony.\nWelcome to your family here today.\nThroughout this hearing, and with questions for the record,\nthe committee members are going to have the opportunity to\nlearn more about your commitment to public service for our\ngreat Nation.\nI have to ask a couple of questions for the record, which\nwe do of all nominees. The first is, do you agree, if\nconfirmed, to appear before this committee or designated\nmembers of the committee and other appropriate committees of\nCongress and provide information, subject to appropriate and\nnecessary security protection, with respect to your\nresponsibilities?\nMr. Wallace. I do.\nSenator Barrasso. And do you agree to ensure that\ntestimony, briefings, documents and electronic and other forms\nof information are provided to this committee and its staff and\nother appropriate committees in a timely manner?\nMr. Wallace. Yes.\nSenator Barrasso. And do you know of any matters, which you\nmay or may not have disclosed, that might place you in any\nconflict of interest if you are confirmed?\nMr. Wallace. I do not.\nSenator Barrasso. I will now begin with questions. Then we\nwill alternate back and forth, Senator Carper will go after I\ndo.\nCan you just explain a little bit about how your\nexperiences that you have had prepared you to oversee the\nNational Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service? You\ntalked a bit about it in your opening statement. Anything else\nthat comes to mind in terms of specific experience? I know you\nhave been a rescue ranger, worked the back country, have seen\nit from all different levels.\nMr. Wallace. I think one of the great things about being\nhere at this time in my career is having seen a lot of\ndifferent aspects of both the Park Service and the Fish and\nWildlife Service and the Endangered Species Act, to the point\nwhere you see the power of good people coming together to solve\ncomplicated problems. I have seen that throughout my career. I\nknow you all work with it every day in the committee.\nBut it is the belief, as I said in my statement, people\nworking in good faith on complicated issues can achieve\nremarkable, good things.\nSenator Barrasso. And along that line, I think about the\nAmerican Water Infrastructure Act that we got through the\nSenate 99 to 1, it authorizes increased funding for things like\nwatercraft inspection stations, in order to stop the spread of\naquatic invasive species. The committee also led the enactment\nof the WILD Act, Wildlife Innovation and Longevity Driver Act,\nrequires the specific agencies to develop strategic plans to\nreduce invasive species, on lands that they manage, and\nprovides, actually, cash prizes for innovative solutions to\nbetter combat the invasive species.\nWhat is your assessment, if I could, of the invasive\nspecies threat to our Nation's wildlife in the national park\nsystem, and can we better use and coordinate efforts along\nthose lines?\nMr. Wallace. That is a question I have thought a lot about\nsince the President nominated me for this position. We have,\nSenator Barrasso, as you know, invasive species in Wyoming,\nwhether it is cheat grass or lake trout in Yellowstone or even\ntrying to prevent quagga mussels from getting into the Snake\nRiver drainage and getting all the way down into the Columbia\nRiver. Every time I heard the word invasive species, I think it\nis just going to turn out like a bad vampire movie, because it\nis something that whatever you do, you are not going to be able\nto curtail.\nI think, if confirmed for this position, it is a chance to\nreally think through what the departments are already doing,\nand see if we have to take our game up to a different level.\nBecause they are everywhere.\nSenator Barrasso. I am thinking about the time you were\nchief of staff for Governor Geringer. He served at the same\ntime Senator Carper was a Governor, so we have the State side\nof this, then we have the Federal side of it. Do you have any\nthoughts on how we can foster better coordination between\nFederal and State wildlife agencies? Because States are putting\na lot of money into wildlife efforts as well.\nMr. Wallace. I have. The word partner is a very easy word\nto say, we all say partner, but it is a lot harder to do. It\ntakes a lot of work. What do you mean by partnerships? It is\nrespecting the government-to-government partnerships between\ntribes and between States and sometimes local communities, it\nis respecting the partnerships between NGO's and conservation\ngroups that care deeply.\nAnd a partnership is a partnership. That is what you commit\nto, you work with a State, you get the best advice from the\nprofessionals that work on an issue, and you work\nconstructively toward a solution.\nSenator Barrasso. And I want to pick up on the word\npartnership, because, as you used it, under the leadership of\nthis committee, the reauthorization of what is the Partners for\nFish and Wildlife program was enacted into law in March. It is\na voluntary program encouraging U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\nand private landowners, because I had asked you about State and\nFederal, but I am talking about now U.S. Fish and Wildlife and\nprivate landowners to work together on habitat conservation and\nrestoration projects. Can you talk about proactive, voluntary\nconservation efforts, by landowners, private entities, when it\ncomes to protecting wildlife and their habitat?\nMr. Wallace. I look forward to working with you and the\ncommittee and others and implementing that Act, if confirmed.\nSenator Barrasso. So there is an important role, working\nwith the private landowners as well, and other private\nentities, in terms of working along those lines.\nAs Assistant Secretary, you are going to oversee both the\nFish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service.\nAlthough these agencies have fundamentally different missions,\nthe authorities often overlap, certainly on lands across the\nwest. You have seen it first-hand in Grand Teton and\nYellowstone National Parks. The lands provide habitat for\nimportant species and are also drivers of the local economies.\nYou see it all around Wyoming.\nIf confirmed, how would you balance the diverse and\nsometimes competing missions of these two different agencies\nthat you will oversee?\nMr. Wallace. I think, Senator, the issue there is the\ninteragency working groups that have come together on grizzly\nbears and others that we have seen throughout Wyoming and I am\nsure in other parts of the west. It is making sure those\ninteragency groups are working together, coordinating with one\nanother and not creating confusing data for the public to\ndigest and try and understand.\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you. Senator Carper.\nSenator Carper. I was happy to hear the name Jim Geringer.\nWe served together 6 years, I was elected in 1992, he was\nelected in 1994. Wonderful man, and it was a joy to serve with\nhim.\nI don't mean to ask a bunch of yes or no questions. I would\nask three of them, and then I'll ask questions that will take\nmore than yes or no to respond to.\nThe first question is, do you agree with our Nation's\nleading scientists, including those within the Department of\nInterior, who have concluded that climate change is real, is\ncaused in large part by humans, and is impacting fish, wildlife\nand parks? Do you agree with that?\nMr. Wallace. Senator, I do agree that climate change is an\nissue and that humans have a very important role in that\nsituation.\nSenator Carper. That is good. Thank you. Second question.\nDo you question the conclusions of the Fourth National Climate\nAssessment that stated our Nation's ecosystems and economy are\nat grave risk in the decades to come if we do not take climate\nactions today?\nMr. Wallace. Senator, to be perfectly honest, I haven't\nread the assessment. I am aware of it, along with the IPCC 1.5.\nYes, I am aware of the issues. I know that scientists are\nclearly moving in that direction. But to be fair, I have not\nread the report.\nSenator Carper. I will just ask you to answer again, for\nthe record.\nMr. Wallace. OK.\nSenator Carper. Thank you.\nLast yes or no question. Do you commit to this committee\nthat if confirmed, you will not directly or indirectly\ninterfere or undermine climate science?\nMr. Wallace. Senator, I believe in the importance of\nclimate science and the independence of science.\nSenator Carper. I will take that, thank you. Followup\nquestion, if I could. As Assistant Secretary for Fish and\nWildlife and Parks, what will you do to make our parks and\nrefuges more resilient in the face of climate change?\nMr. Wallace. Let me take a drink of water on that one.\nSenator Carper. I will say it again while you take a drink\nof water. As Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and\nParks, what will you do to make our parks and refuges more\nresilient in the face of climate change?\nMr. Wallace. Let me, if I could, sort of describe my job,\nif confirmed, how I see it, Senator. If you looked at the\ncombined assets of both the Fish and Wildlife Service and the\nNational Park Service, there is approximately 1,000 units in 50\nStates and 5 territories. If you look at, I guess one way I\nwould look at your climate question is, to understand where the\nstress is on all of these different agencies, or all of these\ndifferent areas, and have a system in place where you are\nsystematically evaluating how they stand.\nSo in the example of climate change, we know that the\nGovernor of Louisiana is trying to adapt for that anticipation\nby thinking of moving communities up off of southeastern\nLouisiana. You see the Fish and Wildlife Service doing coastal\nresiliency projects in North Carolina with oyster bed\nconstruction.\nIn Alaska, with melting sea ice, it is a completely\ndifferent sort of equation, and how do you evaluate it. And\nalso perhaps the coast of Oregon or Washington State, where\nthey are worried about ocean acidification.\nBut there are also other issues, I think, that adds stress\nto it that I could not ignore if in this position. We talked\nabout invasive species, what is habitat fragmentation doing to\nmigratory corridors in other parts. If you care deeply about\nhistoric areas in the National Park Service, what about\nbattlefields, like Champion Hills and Vicksburg that may be\nrounded out if the parks focus on that? So I certainly\nacknowledge the climate issue, and I also acknowledge that\nthere are other stressors within the system that I would also\nbe responsible for.\nBut let me tell you how I would look at all three of those.\nFirst of all, and foremost, follow the law. What does the law\nsay you have to do, can't do or should do? No. 1. No. 2 is,\nfollow the science. What are your professionals telling you\nabout how to solve these problems? And it is not just the\n50,000-foot science, it is the sort of on the ground science,\nby science managers, applied science, if you will. What are\nthey telling you to do about the problem?\nThen the third, and I talked about this with Senator\nBarrasso, I think it is very important, it is the role of\npartnerships. You can't solve scale problems unless you can\nfigure out how to be a good partner. Sometimes the Federal\nGovernment is the alpha and the partnership debate, and I don't\nthink that is the right construct, especially given so many\ninterests from so many groups around the Country to get\ninvolved.\nSenator Carper. We will take that question; I might come\nback with a question for the record and you can have a chance\nto think about it and respond further. If we have another round\nof questions, I will ask a few more questions. Thank you.\nSenator Barrasso. Senator Cramer.\nSenator Cramer. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank\nyou, Mr. Wallace, for being here.\nWhen Secretary Bernhardt was going through this same\nprocess, he and I dug in a little a little bit on a few issues\nthat, I don't want to call them North Dakota specific, but they\nare rather North Dakota-centric. One in particular that centers\naround the prairie pothole region, and what I think is somewhat\nof a unique situation for North Dakota, in that our farmers,\nover the last century or so, in our rectangle up there in the\nnorthern part of our Country, had been such great stewards of\nwater that they didn't drain a lot of land when it was vogue to\ndo that throughout the prairie. Consequently, sometimes I think\ntheir good actions earlier have been probably biting them a\nlittle bit.\nSo when it comes to specifically WPAs, or the watershed\nprotection area easements that some of our farmers have\ninherited from their great-grandfather or grandfathers, with\nthe lack of a clear delineation, historically poor mapping,\nwhat I consider an inadequate appeals process, lack of\nconsistency with NRCS, particularly Swampbuster, enforcement\ninconsistencies, I raised all these issues with the Secretary\nin hopes that we could work on together, between stakeholders,\npartners, politically diverging ideals, in a way to provide\nbetter clarity for our farmers and avoid what I consider\nsometimes to be enforcement or regulatory takings.\nWith your background, it seems to me you like have a great\nbackground. I was thinking specifically in fact about your sage\ngrouse habitat mitigation work. I would just sort of challenge\nyou at this level now and then we can certainly get into more\nspecifics at a later time, as you get into the job. Just\nlooking for ideas on how we can help these farmers, both within\nthe legal construct, but then with advice, and like I said, if\nthere is a mitigation plan that can accomplish everybody's\ngoals while at the same time allowing our farmers to continue\nto grow food for a growing world population.\nI just want to plant that seed with you and look forward to\na very specific discussion.\nAlso, by the way, the Secretary committed to coming out to\nvisit with our farmers. If you are confirmed prior to whenever\nthat trip takes place, it would be great if you could join him\non that trip. But first of all, just sort of in general, any\nthoughts about WPA easements and some work that we can maybe\nget done that again, accomplishes everybody's goals without\nfurther taking from our landowners?\nMr. Wallace. One of the great things about this job, if I\nam confirmed, is to think about issues that I don't know a lot\nabout. Right now, I can tell you this, Senator, if this is\nimportant to you, I will be committed to learning a lot more\nabout it, perhaps coming to visit with you and meet some of\nyour constituents and hear first-hand the challenges you have.\nAnd to the degree that it is within my ability in the\ndepartment to help, given the legal and scientific issues that\nwill also be there, more than happy to do that.\nSenator Cramer. I appreciate that. And I think one of the\nthings you bring to the job, and you and I had not met before,\nbut when you have such a strong endorsement as the two Senators\nfrom Wyoming have given, it is hard to argue with you, to be\nhonest, not just because he is the Chairman, because I am a\nmember of two Wyoming Senators' chairmanship, but because they\nare such quality people.\nYou seem to be able to bridge the political intricacies\npretty effectively. That is not a minor issue. As you point\nout, Delaware and Wyoming, we oftentimes find big differences.\nBut you seem to have that ability, and I would look forward to\ntapping into that capacity that you have to accomplish these\nthings.\nSo I am just going to leave it at that for now, but I look\nforward to further discussion.\nMr. Wallace. I look forward to learning more about it,\nSenator. Thank you.\nSenator Cramer. Thank you. I look forward to further\ndiscussion.\nSenator Carper. I would add that there is a Wyoming,\nDelaware. And it just south of Dover.\n[Laughter.]\nSenator Carper. I have great affection for Wyoming,\nDelaware.\nSenator Barrasso. Senator Braun.\nSenator Braun. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\nThis is always an enjoyable conversation for me, because I\npractice conservation and at home during our recess, will never\ngive up that part of it, get a few fishing trips in and so\nforth.\nI think it is sometimes overwhelming, invasive species. I\nhave been fighting them on my own properties for years. I\nwonder how far that has gotten out of hand to where we can\nmostly try to contain rather than eliminate. But I don't want\nto focus on that now, I want to focus on what I have observed\nover time and have you weigh in on it.\nTwice during the break, I saw bald eagles on private lakes\nwhere, my goodness, where until maybe 10, 12 years ago in\nIndiana, when I was on the White River, had not seen a bald\neagle. And now, they were doing so well, they are starting to\ncolonize a lot of small lakes and places where you never\nimagined.\nBeavers, I remember as a kid I saw one on Potoka Lake when\nI was about 15 years old. It was like a rare sighting. Deer\nwere basically extinct in Indiana until conservation efforts\nturned around.\nI noticed a lot of good stuff, including otters, to where\nnow there is an open season on otters, simply because they have\nbeen reintroduced and are doing so well. Bobcats would be on\nthe cusp.\nSo when we talk about fish and wildlife, weigh in on what\nis good that is happening. Because it is depressing, to be\nhonest, when we focus on invasive species. I know we need to,\njust, how do we grapple with it? Talk a little bit about what\nyou have observed over the last few decades and are really wins\nand pluses, put it in perspective with all the challenges we\nhave.\nMr. Wallace. Well, Senator, I have observed the same thing\nthat you have over time. When I was a ranger in the Grand\nTeton, the bald eagles were still at risk. Now, they are\nabundant. We have also seen in Wyoming peregrine falcons come\nback, black footed ferrets, through some very collaborative\nbreeding. Sage grouse, which a lot of us have been working to\nkeep off the endangered species list. Whooping cranes, grizzly\nbears have come back. They have come back in force in Wyoming.\nSo you sure look at the wise management of these wildlife\nlaws and say, it has been a success. At the same time, you want\nto know, what can we do better going forward, are there wiser\nways to manage, to think about species recovery. I am fully\naware that will be a responsibility of mine if confirmed for\nthis job.\nSenator Braun. So in general, then, I think it would be\nfair to say that some of the particulars of especially\nconservation and wildlife preservation, we have a lot of good\nthings to talk about. Would you view either invasive species\nand/or climate change as being things that in the near term\ncould set back any of that, where we have had such rapid\nprogression in the right direction? Do you view either one of\nthose, because I agree both are intractable issues. We have to\nfind out a way to deal with them.\nDo you see any of the gains we have made in somewhat\nimmediate threat, or do you think that is in the longer context\nas well?\nMr. Wallace. That is a great question, and I think about\nit, too, because climate is on the minds of lots of people, the\npublic, members. If you look at what is happening in the\nFlorida Everglades with the Burmese python, there are songbirds\nat risk of blinking out down there because of that invasive\nspecies. In Wyoming, about 25 years ago, a bucket biologist\ndumped a bunch of lake trout into Yellowstone Lake, as\npredators of one of the world's richest natural cutthroat\npopulations anywhere in the world. Pound for pound, lake trout\nwins every time over a cutthroat. That was an important food\ngroup for the grizzly bears during the spawning. It really\nstarted to upset the entire balance of Yellowstone.\nIt took biologists a number of years to figure out they had\nan invasive species problem, and then what to do about it. It\nwas more than just letting everybody go out and catch as many\nlake trout as they wanted. Because the lake trout were winning\nthat fight every day. They finally brought commercial seiners\nin from the Great Lakes that are catching hundreds of thousands\nof lake trout a year. I talked to the superintendent a few days\nago, he said they put as much in gill netting down in\nYellowstone Lake every year to stretch from Yellowstone to\nNaples, Florida, just to get a handle on an invasive species.\nSo it goes to your point, Senator, that I think the Federal\nagencies and State agencies need to be observant to identifying\na potential risk, is it coming, what can you do to prevent it.\nIf it is here, how do you stabilize it, and then what do you do\nto reverse it. Those threats, I believe there is an Asian Carp\nCoalition here from members in the Mississippi and the Great\nLakes. It is a big issue. I would be glad to have support to\nthink seriously about that.\nSenator Braun. Thank you.\nMr. Wallace. Thank you, Senator.\nSenator Barrasso. Senator Markey, welcome.\nSenator Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much.\nThe Monomoy Refuge, Mr. Wallace, in 2015, the Fish and\nWildlife Service finalized a revised comprehensive conservation\nplan for the Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge that\nreinterpreted the refuge boundaries to include the waters and\nsubmerged lands to the west of the refuge. This potentially\nmakes it harder for Chatham residents to moor fishing boats,\nhunt or collect shellfish in those waters as they have been\ndoing so for years.\nThe Trump Administration has advocated for more\nrecreational access to public lands, refuges and parks. But in\nthe Monomoy Refuge, the Town of Chatham and its residents are\nconcerned that they are losing their longstanding access.\nMr. Wallace, if confirmed, will you commit to working with\nme to ensure public access, while also protecting the\nenvironment in this special place?\nMr. Wallace. Senator, I will. I know this is a very\nimportant issue to you. You have raised it at Interior. I have\nhad a chance to learn a little bit about it by speaking with\nyour staff recently. If it would be helpful, I would be happy\nto come up there with you to meet with the people in Chatham\nand understand it first-hand. Thank you.\nSenator Markey. Yes, the town of Chatham has been a great\nsteward of these waters, dating back more than 60 years. I am a\nstrong supporter of our national refuges and believe that our\nbeautiful lands and waters deserve protection. It is my hope\nthat we can find a resolution to this issue that continues to\nprotect and safeguard this unique piece of our Country. So I\nwould appreciate it if you would come.\nMr. Wallace, if you are confirmed, you would be in charge\nof our parks and refuges, a collection of national treasures\nthat belong to all Americans. As Senator Carper has already\nnoted in his questions, climate change is threatening these\nbeautiful wild places. Rainfall is down, wildfires are up, bark\nbeetles and pathogens are spreading and species are\ndisappearing.\nMr. Wallace, to followup on Senator Carper's conversation\nwith you, will you commit to addressing the climate crisis as\npart of your management of our national parks, wildlife,\nrefuges, if confirmed?\nMr. Wallace. Senator, yes. The key, as I mentioned earlier,\nthere are three stools to this. You have to adapt and to\nmoderate the consequences of not only climate, but invasive\nspecies. But to do that within the law, with what the\nscientists are telling us and to work in strong partnership to\ndo that work.\nSenator Markey. Yes, I just don't think it is possible to\nresponsible stewards and conservationists if we are not dealing\nwith the consequences of the climate crisis. It just goes hand\nin glove for the rest of our lives. We have to responsibly deal\nwith that.\nThe State of Alaska is proposing the development of a 200-\nmile industrial road that would cut through the gates of the\nArctic National Preserve and bisect one of the longest land\nmigration routes in the world. Western Arctic caribou herd\ntravels as far as 2,700 miles a year from their wintering\ngrounds along the Bering Sea to their calving grounds on the\nArctic coastal plain. This migration is longer than the\ndistance between New York and Seattle, and it could be cutoff\nif this road moves forward.\nMr. Wallace, are you aware of this proposal and the\nplanning process currently underway?\nMr. Wallace. Senator, I am actually not that familiar. Of\ncourse, from the news, but I haven't been down to the\nDepartment of Interior yet, having just been the nominee for 22\ndays. But I know this is an issue that will be in my office and\nI will be quickly getting up to speed on it.\nSenator Markey. Obviously, this road is going to have a\nhuge impact on wildlife and public lands in the region. So we\nare going to be working with you on this overseeing what is\ngoing to be taking place here. Because it could have severe\nadverse impacts in that region. We are just going to be\nexpecting you to work with us to make sure that damage does not\noccur.\nSo thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much.\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you very much, Senator Markey.\nWe are fortunate to have joining us now the Senator from\nAlaska, who may have some input on that very issue.\nSenator Sullivan. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I really\nlove my colleague, Ed Markey. He and I work together on a bunch\nof things. But his attention to Alaska sometimes astounds me.\n[Laughter.]\nSenator Sullivan. Because with all due respect to the\nSenator from Alaska, I care a hell of a lot more about Alaska\nand my constituents than he does. So I am just trying to get\nthe numbers of miles of roads that Alaska has relative to\nMassachusetts. My State is probably, well, I know it is 491\ntimes the size of Rhode Island.\nSenator Whitehouse. Yes, you had to say that.\n[Laughter.]\nSenator Sullivan. But it is probably at least 200 times the\nsize of Massachusetts. And I guarantee you, Massachusetts has\nmore roads than my State. So most Alaskans really want roads.\nAnd here is the thing. Unfortunately, radical environmental\ngroups always do this, oh, my God, everything is going to die\nwhen you build a road, a damned road. In most States, you can\nbuild a road anywhere you want, and you don't have 80\nenvironmental groups suing to stop it. But in my State, you try\nto build a road, one damned road, and you will have so many\noutside groups who don't care about my constituents, suing to\nstop a road.\nMost people just assume you can build a road anywhere in\nAmerica. Can't build a road in Alaska, though, because of\ncolleagues like my friend, good friend Ed Markey, who want to\nstop roads.\nSenator Barrasso. What is the number on the roads?\nSenator Sullivan. We have a third the number of miles of\nroads than Massachusetts, and we are probably at least 200\ntimes the size of the State. So just take that one there, Mr.\nWallace. We are going to be working on making sure--and by the\nway, when you hear the parade of horribles, remember last time\nthere was a parade of horrible on the porcupine caribou herd is\nwhen we built the Trans-Alaska pipeline, one of the most\nimportant features of American energy independence in certainly\nour Country.\nThe parade of horribles was the porcupine caribou herd was\ngoing to be destroyed. It increased four times the size when\nthe pipeline was built. Now, you never hear the radical\nenvironmental groups saying that, because it wasn't true. The\nsame stuff is going on with the development of Anwar, which you\nare going to have a role in, which this Congress passed, the\nPresident signed, the Alaskan people want it, almost 70 percent\nwant it.\nSo we are going to work with you on that as well. But don't\nbelieve the hype. We need roads in Alaska. They are not going\nto harm the caribou. And the outside groups that want to shut\ndown Alaska, who none of them live there, by the way, you are\ngoing to listen to my constituents more than those groups,\nbecause my constituents want roads, we need roads.\nThis just kind of aggravates me, as you can see. I have so\nmany Senators caring about roads in my State, when they have a\nlot more roads than my State does. And it is not fair, it is\nnot fair. You can't build a road in Alaska, because outside\ngroups stop to sue it, sue to stop it. It is outrageous. I wish\nthey would come and sue when you guys in Rhode Island or\nMassachusetts wanted to build a road. Nobody sues to stop\nbuilding roads in your States. But they all come to my State.\nSo we are going to work on that, and we are going to build\nthat road. And it is not going to hurt the caribou at all.\nSo let me get to my questions. Mr. Wallace, the Supreme\nCourt recently ruled nine to zero, Elena Kagan in a landmark\ndecision for Alaska in a case just recently, called Sturgeon v.\nFrost, which was about ANILCA. I am sure you are familiar with\nANILCA, another huge Federal law that tried to lock up Alaska\npassed in 1980. To just kind of--well, first, have you read the\nSturgeon v. Frost case?\nMr. Wallace. Senator, I have not.\nSenator Sullivan. So before we vote on your confirmation, I\nthink it is critical that you read that decision. Can I get\nyour commitment that you will?\nMr. Wallace. If it is important to you, Senator, I will do\nthat, yes.\nSenator Sullivan. It is a really important case. It\nessentially says that for decades, ANILCA has not been\nimplemented correctly by Federal agencies, Fish and Wildlife\nService, National Park Service. So I would like to get a\ncommitment with you, this is a nine to zero Supreme Court case,\nto work with me as you look to revise your regulations that\nwould implement the holding of the U.S. Supreme Court nine to\nzero in Sturgeon v. Frost. Can I get your commitment to work\nwith me and my office on that?\nMr. Wallace. Senator, if it is an important issue to you,\nit will be an important issue to me.\nSenator Barrasso. Can I interrupt for 1 second, Senator?\nSo, ANILCA, for those of us, it is the Alaska National Interest\nLands Conservation Act passed in 1980.\nSenator Sullivan. Correct.\nSenator Barrasso. For some other members of the committee\nand the audience. Thank you.\nSenator Sullivan. Thank you. And let me ask, I know I am\nrunning out of time, I didn't think I was going to talk about\nroads, but my colleague got me spun up on that.\nWe have a problem in southeast Alaska with sea otters,\nwhich have grown in enormous numbers in terms of population.\nThey are not listed as endangered. And they are having a very\nnegative impact on a very important industry in southeast\nAlaska, shellfish, fin fish, fisheries. I was just in southeast\nAlaska the last couple of weeks and this issue is reaching kind\nof an emergency level proportions.\nCan I get your commitment, Mr. Wallace, if confirmed, to\nwork with me and my office on addressing this big issue with\nregard to the sea otter population and its negative impact on\nfisheries in Alaska, which is really, like I said, reaching\ncrisis proportions?\nMr. Wallace. Senator, this is marine mammal issue on taking\nwith the sea otter.\nSenator Sullivan. It is, and it is also the decimation that\nthey have had with regard to the fishing industry. But the Fish\nand Wildlife Service has oversight and responsibility as it\nrelates to this issue.\nMr. Wallace. I commit to learning a lot more about this\nissue than I know now, and be back to visit with you about it.\nSenator Sullivan. Great. Thank you. Thank you, Mr.\nChairman.\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you, Senator Sullivan. Senator\nWhitehouse.\nSenator Whitehouse. Thank you, Chairman.\nWelcome, Mr. Wallace. The Chairman speaks very highly of\nyou and says that I am probably going to like you. He is a very\nhonorable man and I appreciate that very much.\nYou do suffer the catastrophic disability of being from a\nlandlocked State, however.\n[Laughter.]\nSenator Whitehouse. But I think your sense of nature and\nher beauty is probably animated every time you wake up and see\nthe glow of the dawn on the Tetons. You certainly do come from\na special place in the world.\nI wanted to ask you a little bit about a local issue, and\nthen an oceans issue. The local issue is that we have a\nBlackstone Valley park that has been worked on for some time.\nIt is still being fully defined. And unlike other national\nparks where you start with basically a big empty piece of land,\nyou draw the metes and bounds and you say, that is a park now,\nthis park exists in a very developed environment. It is a\nseries of specific locations threaded through by the historic\nBlackstone River. It runs up into Massachusetts as well.\nIt has been described as like a pearl necklace with all\nthese different pearls along the way, and the thread that ties\nthem together is the river. But it has been through being a\nprotected area, it has been through being a national protected\nriver, it has been through a whole variety of iterations on its\nway to becoming a national park.\nSo it is not an easy thing to run through. There are a lot\nof bureaucratic hooks and attachment, there is a lot of stuff\ngoing on. And you have to think about park land in a slightly\nnew way to adapt it to the existing developed environment this\npark will inhabit.\nSo I am going to need to be able to talk to you about that,\nand to get your attention. Because this is not the type of park\nyou are used to out west, where you come to the gate and there\nis the park ranger, and in you go and now you are on park land.\nThis is a very different idea of how you can make a park work.\nAnd not only are we trying to thread the river through all of\nthis, we are trying to make sure that the river is traversable\nthrough all of this area, so that there are put-ins and take-\nouts for canoes, and for people who don't want to do that, that\nthere are bike paths that connect all of this.\nAnd all of this is through built areas, and in-built areas.\nSo it has been a long, long, long, long, long, slow, process I\njust want to make sure that you will take a good look at this\nwhen you get in. I want the chance to come and talk you through\nwhat this has been and where we are trying to get, so that you\nunderstand that the command level, the complexities of closing\nout this particular park and launching it as a crown jewel of\nNew England.\nMr. Wallace. Senator, I look forward to working with you,\nif confirmed, on this issue. We will certainly know more about\nit the next time we see each other than I do right now.\nSenator Whitehouse. Yes. Well, thank you, and we will get\ntogether on that.\nMr. Wallace. OK.\nSenator Whitehouse. The other issue I want to talk with you\nabout is oceans. Again, from Wyoming, we are always a little\nbit suspicious of landlocked States and how much interest they\nwill have in oceans. The Department of Interior has a long,\nlong history of focusing on the west and on inland and upland\nissues, without paying much attention to coastal issues. We are\nnow seeing dramatic coastal changes, driven by sea level rise,\ntemperature change, acidification, the concerns that you have\nmentioned already.\nBut it makes the coasts a matter of real concern. And I\nwanted to let you know that not only is it a matter of really\ngrave concern, but it is also a matter of real bipartisan\nopportunity. Ocean plastics is a critical issue. The Interior\nDepartment website talks about the eight million tons of\nplastic waste that gets dumped in the oceans every year. The\nPresident signed Senator Sullivan's and my legislation in a\nvery, how shall we say, lively Oval Office ceremony. It passed\nunanimously in the Senate. It passed on suspension in the\nHouse. We are working on another one that we are hoping will\npass unanimously. Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma has been one of\nour key supporters on all of this.\nSo what I want you to take away from this is a, we are\ngoing to be coming after you on oceans. You need to pay\nattention to this. It is not just upland and inland any longer.\nAnd b, there are big, big bipartisan opportunities for you to\nhelp lead and to support in this area. We are often a divided\ncommittee. On these oceans issues, acidification, plastics, sea\nlevel rise, coastal wetlands, there is enormous potential.\nSeize the day.\nMr. Wallace. Again, this is an area, as you noted, I am\nfrom a landlocked State. But I am certainly aware of the issues\nthat members like you in the coastal States are grappling with.\nI look forward to learning a lot more about what we are doing\nat the Department of Interior, the opportunity for\npartnerships, coastal resiliency issues. Thank you, I will be\nsmarter on that one, too, the next time I see you.\nSenator Whitehouse. And some day, Mr. Chairman, we might\neven change the name so it is not just the Department of the\nInterior.\n[Laughter.]\nSenator Whitehouse. There are some edges that count too.\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse. And\nheading to one of those edges, welcome back, Senator Sullivan.\nSenator Sullivan. Mr. Chairman, thanks again. Mr. Wallace,\nI just want to reiterate what my friend, Senator Whitehouse,\nmentioned. There is a great opportunity, we will be introducing\nour Save Our Seas 2.0 legislation here soon, where we think\nthere is a great bipartisan opportunity. The President and the\nAdministration are really engaged on these issues. And it is\nactually an environmental issue that is solvable. Estimates are\nanywhere up from ten rivers, five countries in Asia constitute\nover 80 percent of the plastic ocean waste in the world.\nSo there is a lot we can do. Senator Whitehouse has really\nbeen the leader on this in the Senate. He and I have been\nworking together the last several years on it. We want to bring\nyou in on that. It is a great area of bipartisan cooperation\nwith everybody on board, industry, environmental groups, the\nTrump Administration, Democrats, Republicans. I think we\nshould, as he mentioned, seize the day. So we will have a good\nopportunity to talk about this in our followup meeting\ntomorrow, I think.\nSenator Whitehouse. And I would just commend the Chairman\nand the Ranking Member for their bipartisan engagement on this\nissue as well. It has really been terrific.\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse.\nSenator Braun?\nSenator Braun. Thank you. I have a bill that proposes that\nwe take a defined inventory on the maintenance that is required\non Federal properties. Indiana Dunes is now a national park. It\nwas up there a few weeks ago. One of the original homesteads in\nthat area, which was used by the State, it has fallen into\ndisrepair, several million dollars' worth of cost.\nWhat is your opinion on the need to size up to see what the\ncost is? It is maybe estimated $15 billion to $20 billion, no\none really knows. Do you think with an asset base that large,\nthat we ought to have an inventory of what the maintenance\nneeds would be?\nMr. Wallace. Senator, again, having not been down to the\ndepartment yet, it is one of those issues that I would like to\ntake back to the professionals down there to see how they are\nthinking about this issue. You are certainly, your question\nmakes a lot of sense. You ought to know what you are trying to\nfix before you go fix something. Just on the surface of what\nyou just told me, it makes eminently good sense.\nSenator Braun. I would like you to keep that in the\nconsideration. Once the process is concluded and you are there,\nI would like you to keep that in mind. Because I think it is\nimportant, that is a huge figure. We need to know what it is\nand then start tackling the problem. Thank you.\nMr. Wallace. Thank you, Senator.\nSenator Barrasso. Senator Carper.\nSenator Carper. Mr. Wallace, as I mentioned in my opening\nstatement, Delaware is real proud of, not of the fact that we\nwere the last State to have a national park designated, but we\nwere the first State, Delaware was the first State to ratify\nthe Constitution. For seven whole days, Delaware was the entire\nUnited States of America.\nAnd we opened things up, we let in Maryland, Pennsylvania,\nNew Jersey, and I think it has turned out all right most of the\ntime. But our national park actually focuses on Delaware's\nhistorical, the arrival of the first Swedes and Finns to\nAmerica, in Delaware, the Dutch presence in Lewes, Delaware.\nThe last, I believe, the oldest standing house in America is in\nLewes, Delaware. William Penn came to America in New Castle,\nDelaware, brought with him the deeds to what ultimately became\nPennsylvania and Delaware. And the Constitution was first\nratified in Dover, Delaware on December 7th, 1787.\nThe National park in Delaware actually tells part of the\nhistory of our Country through the eyes of Delaware and through\nthose sites and places in Delaware that I have just mentioned.\nThe National Park Service has identified a location for a\nvisitor center at the park, but has not yet committed to move\nto design and construction. The park is also in need of\nadditional signage and a deer management plan. I would just ask\nyou, if you might be willing to come and visit, if confirmed,\nto visit our State and take a look at our park and some of what\nwe are really proud of, and also some of our needs.\nMr. Wallace. Senator, I would be honored to do that. Thank\nyou for the invitation.\nSenator Carper. You are welcome. Thank you for the answer.\nMr. Wallace. It is a yes, it is a yes.\nSenator Carper. Next question. The Trump Administration has\nreassigned, I am told, several dozens of senior executive\nservice employees. Some of these employees were outspoken,\napparently, on climate change. A number of the reassignments\nhave been perceived as retaliatory. Rather than accept\nreassignment, several of these dedicated public servants\nultimately left the department.\nAs Assistant Secretary, would you be willing to provide to\nCongress detailed information about the rationale behind any\nfuture SES reassignments upon request? I am not asking about\npast, looking back. Not retrospective, but in perspective.\nMr. Wallace. My sense, Senator, is that there would be a\nlot of privacy information. But again, I am not down there, I\nam not aware of, I am certainly aware because of the news about\nthe SES issues. I would tell you personally I value greatly the\nSES people that I have run across during my time in government.\nI just don't know enough about this issue to make a commitment\none way or the other about it. I am sorry, but I don't.\nSenator Carper. All right. Then I am going to ask, would\nyou commit to protect career staff at the Department of\nInterior, moving forward, and to bolster their expertise\ninstead of suppressing it?\nMr. Wallace. I am sorry, could you give me that question\nagain, please?\nSenator Carper. Would you commit to protect career staff at\nthe Department of the Interior, and bolster their expertise\ninstead of suppressing it?\nMr. Wallace. I absolutely would. I am a big believer in the\nSES program. We have seen the caliber of the leaders that have\ncome through, both in the Fish and Wildlife Service and the\nPark Service, they are just the tops. So I am a strong\nproponent of that. I also want a pipeline in place, so if\nsomebody moves on, retires, takes another job, there is a bench\nto come in and fill behind them of equally capable people.\nSo yes, sir.\nSenator Carper. Thank you. And one last question. People\ntravel from around the world to view birds and other wildlife\nat our two national wildlife refuges that sit right on the\nDelaware Bay. Bombay Hook is one of them, and the other is\ncalled Prime Hook. These special refuges employ less than a\ndozen people, and they have hundreds of acres, cover hundreds\nand hundreds of acres. But they employ less than a dozen\npeople. The staff works hard to maintain the refuges and makes\nsure they remain accessible to the public.\nAmong other important positions, our refuges have a visitor\nservices coordinator and a law enforcement official. As the\nTrump Administration continues Department of Interior\nreorganization efforts, would you commit to us today that\nrefuge employees, like Delaware's, will not lose critical staff\nas a result? And how will you work with refuge managers and\nproject leaders to make sure their staffing needs are met?\nMr. Wallace. I would be able to answer this, Senator\nCarper, in a general way, but also with a commitment, if we\nmake that visit to the national park together, maybe also talk\nmore and see more about the issue that you just raised with me\npersonally. But we need motivated men and women in the National\nPark Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service that get up\nevery day and whistle while they go to work.\nSenator Carper. Like we do here in the Senate.\n[Laughter.]\nMr. Wallace. Exactly. I will do it in my job, if confirmed.\n[Laughter.]\nMr. Wallace. So the health and well-being and the training\nand the morale, there would be 3,000 people under the Assistant\nSecretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, who are all going to\nbe an important priority to me in terms of their training and\ntheir morale. I will be happy to learn more about the people in\nthe refuge system that you just spoke of.\nSenator Carper. We appreciate your answers. We probably\nhave a couple of questions for the record, and if confirmed, we\nlook forward to welcoming you, and perhaps your family, to the\nFirst State. Thanks very much.\nSenator Barrasso. I want to thank you, Senator Carper.\nI do have a letter of support for the nomination of Rob\nWallace from the National Wildlife Refuge Association. It is\nfrom Geoffrey Haskett, he is the president of the association,\nwho writes, ``We believe Mr. Wallace has the background,\nexperience, and leadership abilities to perform in an\nexceptional manner in the position of Assistant Secretary.'' I\nask unanimous consent to enter this letter into the record.\nSenator Carper. I object.\n[Laughter.]\nSenator Barrasso. Then I have 40 more. And they are\nwonderful letters----\nSenator Carper. I don't object.\n[Laughter.]\nSenator Barrasso [continuing]. of over sportsmen,\nenvironmental, and conservation groups have written in support\nof the nomination of Rob Wallace. These groups universally\npraised Rob's work experience, his knowledge of our Nation's\npublic lands and wildlife. And I ask unanimous consent to enter\nthese into the record.\n[The referenced material follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nSenator Barrasso. And speaking of whistling your way to\nwork, I noticed joining us in the back of the room is Kathi\nWise, 40 years worked with Malcolm Wallop, worked with you as a\nmember of the staff of Senator Wallop's team. Remains a stellar\nemployee, whistles while she comes to work every day, really a\ntreasure of the Senate. I just want to know if she has always\nhad that kind of dedication and hard work and such character\nand credibility, or is that something you instilled in her as\nshe was working with you as Malcolm's chief of staff? Or has\nthat always been a part of her life?\nMr. Wallace. It is a legacy issue, Senator.\n[Laughter.]\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you for being here, thank you for\nbringing your family and so many friends. The opportunity for\nother members to put questions in for the record, we ask that\nthey submit questions for the record by Thursday, June 6th,\nclose of business. The nominee should respond to the questions\nby June 12th.\nI want to thank you and congratulate you, thank you for\nyour time and thank you for your testimony today.\nCongratulations.\n[Whereupon, at 11:23 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]\n[all]",

John Barrasso\n(chairman of the committee) presiding.\nPresent: Senators Barrasso, Carper, Cramer, Braun, Rounds,\nSullivan, Ernst, Cardin, Whitehouse, Markey, Van Hollen.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BARRASSO,\nU.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WYOMING\nSenator Barrasso. Good morning. I call this hearing to\norder.\nToday we will consider the nomination of Rob Wallace to be\nAssistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife, and Parks at the\nDepartment of the Interior. Once confirmed, he will oversee the\nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service.\nHis confirmation will be especially important, as neither of\nthese agencies have Senate-confirmed leadership at this time.\nHe will play a central role in managing fish and wildlife for\nthe American public. That includes combatting invasive species,\nrecovering endangered species, protecting migratory birds,\nrestoring fisheries, and conserving and enhancing wildlife\nhabitat.\nI have known Rob Wallace for over 35 years. Without\nquestion, Rob is the right person for this job. Throughout his\nlong and distinguished career, Rob has struck the proper\nbalance between wildlife conservation, habitat management, and\nthe use of our public lands. Rob's experience and leadership in\nWyoming and in our Nation's capital are ideally suited for this\ncritically important position.\nThroughout his 45-year career, Rob has served in a variety\nof jobs that directly relate to the two Federal agencies that\nhe is being nominated to oversee. Rob began his career as a\nseasonal park ranger in Grand Teton National Park. Since then,\nRob has served as Assistant Director of the National Park\nService, as Chief of Staff for Wyoming Senator Malcolm Wallop,\nas Staff Director of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural\nResources Committee, as Chief of Staff for Wyoming Governor Jim\nGeringer, and as manager of U.S. Government Relations for GE\nEnergy.\nRob currently serves as President of the Upper Green River\nConservancy, the Nation's first cooperative conservation bank.\nRob co-founded the Upper Green River Conservancy to protect\ncore sage grouse habitat in the ecologically and energy-rich\nupper Green River Watershed in Southwest Wyoming. He built an\ninnovative partnership of ranchers, conservation groups, energy\ncompanies, investors and other stakeholders.\nRob is also a founding member of the board of the Grand\nTeton National Park Foundation, which promotes the park's\ncultural, historic and natural resources. He is a member of the\nboard of the Jackson Hole Land Trust, which protects open\nspaces, wildlife habitat, and working lands across northwest\nWyoming.\nIn addition, Rob serves as a member of the University of\nWyoming's Energy Resources Council. The Council sets priorities\nfor energy-related academics, research and outreach. He has\nalso served on the boards of numerous organizations dedicated\nto conserving wildlife and enhancing our national parks.\nWith credentials like these, it is no surprise that\nstakeholders from across the political spectrum have\nenthusiastically endorsed Rob's nomination. Dan Ashe, the\nformer Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service during\nthe Obama administration, and now the President and now the\nPresident of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, wrote, ``I\nhave a good context for what creates success in this important\nand challenging position: a passion for the mission of the U.S.\nFish and Wildlife Service, and the National Park Service.'' He\ngoes on to say, ``An appreciation and admiration for the people\nwho do the work, a penchant for listening, and a dedication to\ninclusive problem-solving.'' He concludes by saying, ``In my\nview, Rob displays all of these crucial characteristics.''\nRichie Jones, the State Director for the Nature Conservancy\nin Delaware, also endorsed Rob's nomination. He has also\nreceived the support of over 40 environmental, conservation,\nand recreational organizations, including the National Parks\nConservation Association, the National Wildlife Refuge\nAssociation, the Public Lands Council, Ducks Unlimited,\nAmerican Sportfishing Association, congressional Sportsmen\nFoundation, and the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation\nPartnership.\nConfirming Rob is important to the work of this committee.\nThe Environment and Public Works Committee has jurisdiction\nover fish and wildlife policy, including the U.S. Fish and\nWildlife Service. Earlier this year, Congress enacted the\nWildlife Innovation and Longevity Driver Act, also known as the\nWILD Act. We did so to combat invasive species, to prevent\nwildlife poaching and trafficking, to promote wildlife\nconservation and to protect endangered species.\nSo I look forward to working with Rob to implement the WILD\nAct. I am in the process of developing legislation to modernize\nthe Endangered Species Act. I continue to engage with State\nfish and wildlife agencies, environmental groups, conservation\norganizations, ranchers, farmers, energy producers, and others\nfrom across the political spectrum. I hope to gain their\nsupport and ultimately the support of a bipartisan group of\nSenators for a bill that modernizes the Endangered Species Act\nso it works better for species and for people.\nRob demonstrated to the Upper Green River Conservancy that\nit is possible to build such a coalition, focused on solving\nthe problems of the Endangered Species Act. So I look forward\nto working with him on modernizing this important law.\nRob Wallace is an outstanding choice for the position of\nAssistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife, and Parks. I look\nforward to moving his nomination expeditiously through the\nconfirmation process.\nI will now turn to Ranking Member Carper for his opening\nstatement.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. THOMAS R. CARPER,\nU.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF DELAWARE\nSenator Carper. Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr.\nWallace, welcome. I want to welcome you and your daughters this\nmorning.\nAlso, I would like to welcome Senator Mike Enzi, one of our\nfavorite colleagues. I listened to the Chairman's opening\nstatement, it sounds like you have his support, and Mike Enzi's\nsupport, Dan Ashe's support, Richie Jones' support from\nDelaware, a whole host, like a Who's Who of organizations here\nthat represent and look after the fish and wildlife, endangered\nspecies and habitat protection, conservation. This is one of\nthose deals where you may just want to ask somebody to make a\nmotion, and we just vote.\nSenator Barrasso. So moved.\n[Laughter.]\nSenator Carper. We can all take an early lunch.\nSeriously, we appreciate your willingness to do this. It is\nalways great to have Mike Enzi in the room, and we appreciate\nyour family being here, too. We appreciate your willingness to\nserve in this role as Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife\nand Parks. I think it has to be a great job. Of all the jobs\nyou could have, this has to be one of the best.\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park\nService are two agencies that, as we know, play critical roles\nin managing and protecting our Nation's most treasured natural\nresources and public lands. I am sure you will agree, given\nyour experience as a park ranger, as a youngster, and as\nsomeone who has lived a life that I think you can be proud of.\nIn Delaware, we are extremely proud of our two national\nwildlife refuges, and one of the Country's newest national\nparks, the First State National Historical Park. Our refuges\nare home to threatened and endangered species, and people from\nall over the world travel to Delaware to visit these refuges,\nas well as our national park.\nOverseeing these agencies and beloved public lands is no\nsmall task, but one that you seem prepared for, and I believe\nare passionate about. I especially appreciate the statement in\nyour testimony, and this is a quote from you, ``Bipartisan\nsolutions are always the lasting ones. Those are words of\nwisdom.''\nI could not agree more. And I hope that we will be able to\ncount on you to bring that balanced approach to the\nAdministration's Department of the Interior.\nUnfortunately, having said that, unfortunately, the\nDepartment and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in particular\nhave taken actions in the last couple of years that could\njeopardize our Nation's wildlife without bipartisan support\nfrom Members of Congress. Specifically, the Administration has\nproposed regulation that could dramatically alter\nimplementation of the Endangered Species Act, one of our\nNation's most popular and effective environmental laws. These\nregulations could undermine the science that is supposed to\ndrive species protection decisions.\nThis Administration has also adopted an unprecedented legal\nopinion relative to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, a stance\nthat former top Fish and Wildlife Service officials from both\nRepublican and Democratic administrations have vehemently\nopposed. What is more, the Trump Administration has reassigned\ndozens of Department of Interior senior executive service\nemployees without good reasons, which is reportedly creating a\nculture of fear within the Department. Surpassing the expertise\nof career public servants is an injustice to natural resources\nthat the Department is tasked with managing.\nAll of these actions, along with a number of others, are\ndeeply concerning. Mr. Wallace, I would just say, as this\ncommittee considers your nomination, I hope you will heed these\nconcerns and clearly convey a willingness to moderate some of\nthese trouble actions. I also hope that we can work together to\nfind bipartisan opportunities that support both solid science\nand conservation.\nI believe that tackling climate change is one such\nopportunity. And due to climate change, our treasured national\nparks and refuges in the west are increasingly beset by\ncatastrophic fires. Worsening storms are damaging our coastal\nparks and refuges.\nRecently, the National Parks Conservation Association found\nthat out of 417 parks surveyed, 96 percent faced significant\nair quality problems. You will learn more about how you will\nwork to address these challenges. I believe it is now more\nimportant than ever that we work together to make sure our\nparks and our refuges are more resilient to climate change so\nthat Americans may have the opportunity to visit these places\nfor generations to come.\nMr. Wallace, you also possess a great deal of expertise in\nhabitat conservation and mitigation. You and I have discussed\nyour work in both Wyoming and in Delaware on projects that mean\na great deal to each of us and to this committee. Clearly, you\nunderstand the importance of mitigating negative impacts on our\nenvironment. I believe that understanding provides another\ngreat opportunity for you to lead within the Department of the\nInterior.\nSo we look forward to hearing how you will utilize this\nexpertise as Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and\nParks if confirmed. Right now, we need qualified leaders who\nare committed to safeguarding our natural resources. I feel\nconfident that you are up to that challenge.\nThank you again for joining us. Again, welcome to your\nfamily. We look forward to hearing your testimony and to the\nconversation that will follow your testimony. Thank you.\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you, Senator Carper.\nSeeing that Senator Enzi is here, I think if there is any\nSenator that is mentioned in this committee, who is not a\nmember of this committee, the No. 1 person on that list would\nbe Mike Enzi, as you talk about his 80-20 rule, a good way to\nget things done legislatively and in a bipartisan way and\nworking for the way.\nSenator Carper. Absolutely. I was in an Aspen Institute\nseminar in Prague last week, and we focused on U.S. relations\nwith China, U.S. relations with Russia. We talked about Mike\nEnzi and the 80-20 rule. So you are all over the charts and all\nover the map.\nSenator Barrasso. With that, let me welcome to the Senate\nCommittee on Environment and Public Works Senator Mike Enzi,\nSenior Senator for Wyoming, who will do the introduction.\nSenator Enzi, thanks so much for joining us today.\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE ENZI,\nU.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WYOMING\nSenator Enzi. Mr. Chairman. Chairman Barrasso and Ranking\nMember Carper, it is my privilege to introduce Rob Wallace, who\nis testifying in front of your committee today on his\nnomination to serve as Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife,\nand Parks at the Department of Interior.\nI have known Rob for many years, probably most of his life.\nI don't think there could be a better choice to fill the\nposition. I am going to repeat some of the things that Chairman\nBarrasso said. I am a retailer, and I know that when you run an\nad the first time, hardly anybody gets it. If you run it again,\na few more do. And I would be willing to run this several times\nif it would help on the nomination.\nRob was born and raised in Wyoming, where he quickly\nlearned the important role that the Department of Interior\nplays in the upkeep of our State's natural beauty. In fact,\nRob's first job after college was with the National Park\nService. He served as a seasonal ranger in Grand Teton National\nPark. For 5 years, Rob helped with the preservation and\nmaintenance of one of our Nation's finest parks.\nHis passion for our Nation's public lands sent him here to\nWashington, where he handled energy and environment issues for\nformer Wyoming Senator Malcolm Wallop, and before leaving\nCapitol Hill, he served as staff director of the Energy and\nNatural Resources Committee. He returned to Sheridan and the\nincredible Big Horn Mountains, until Rob once again came back\nto Washington, where he served as Assistant Director for the\nNational Park Service for congressional and Legislative\nAffairs.\nDuring this time, he supervised the Reagan administration's\nlegislative agenda for national parks, which included\nreadjusting visitor entrance fees, providing resources to fight\nthe 1988 forest fires, and adding several new units to the\nnational park system. In 1989, Rob became Senator Wallop's\nChief of Staff, before heading back to the Senate Energy and\nNatural Resources Committee in 1991, to again serve as staff\ndirector.\nI first met Rob in 1995, when he served as Chief of Staff\nto the Wyoming Governor Jim Geringer, and I was in the State\nlegislature. These days, Rob is still involved in Wyoming and\nthe management of our public lands. Rob serves as the president\nof the Upper Green River Conservancy. Now, that is a sage\ngrouse habitat bank that partners with ranchers, energy\ncompanies and conservation groups that work together to protect\ncritical sage grouse habitat.\nRob's career and character reflect a man willing to step up\nand serve his community and Country. His years of experience at\nInterior and in the halls of Congress have well suited him to\nthis new chapter. I am pleased to introduce him to you today,\nand I hope you will give his nomination full and fair\nconsideration.\n[The prepared statement of Senator Enzi follows:]\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you for joining us, Senator Enzi.\nWe will have another opportunity tomorrow to introduce Rob,\nbecause this is one of those positions that requires hearings\nin two committees, the Environment and Public Works Committee\nand the Energy Committee. So I look forward to seeing you again\ntomorrow morning in that committee as we introduce our friend,\nRob.\nYou are welcome to stay as long as you like. I know you\nhave a pressing schedule, but thanks for being with us and\njoining us today, Senator Enzi. Thank you.\nNow, I would like to welcome to our committee the nominee,\nRob Wallace, the nominee to be Assistant Secretary for Fish,\nWildlife, and Parks at the Department of the Interior. I want\nto remind you; your full written testimony will be made part of\nthe record. I look forward to hearing your testimony. I see\nsome of your family are here. I know many of your friends are\nhere. So, please, begin at your convenience.\nMr. Wallace. With the opening statement, Senator?\nSenator Barrasso. Please, and if you would like to\nintroduce your family, as well.\nSTATEMENT OF ROBERT WALLACE, NOMINATED TO BE ASSISTANT\nSECRETARY FOR FISH, WILDLIFE, AND PARKS, DEPARTMENT OF THE\nINTERIOR\nMr. Wallace. Absolutely. Chairman Barrasso, Ranking Member\nCarper and members of the committee, thank you for having me\nhere today. I am grateful to the President for nominating me to\nthis position, and thank Secretary Bernhardt for his support.\nI would also like to recognize family members who are here\nfrom Wyoming today, my wife, Celia, who is not only a\nremarkable partner but epitomizes the spirit of bipartisanship,\nhaving worked for both a Democrat and Republican member of the\nSenate years ago.\nMy oldest daughter, Morgan, just finished her sophomore\nyear in engineering at Wake Forest University, and is down from\nNew York where she is doing a renewable energy internship this\nsummer. And my youngest daughter, Ella, finished fourth grade\nand cannot be here today, because she is home studying for the\nSSAT in the event she has to apply for a new school next fall.\n[Laughter.]\nMr. Wallace. The four of us live a mile south of Grand\nTeton National Park and the Yellowstone ecosystem. Each year,\nour community hosts millions of visitors who come to play in\ntwo of the world's majestic national parks. They also marvel at\nthe abundant wildlife we all enjoy, thanks to wise management\nby State and Federal officials, and the National Elk Refuge,\nlocated in the heart of our valley.\nBut I know that simply living in a special place isn't\nsufficient justification to ask for your support to oversee two\nof the world's most celebrated agencies, the National Park\nService, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. So I would\nlike to explain a little bit about how I got here.\nMy journey began decades ago when I was hired right out of\ncollege as a seasonal park ranger in Grand Teton National Park.\nFor the next 5 years, I patrolled the park's rivers and lakes,\nworked with the mountain rescue team, enforced the game and\nfish regulations, performed law enforcement operations and\nemergency medical services on the park's highways, and traveled\non skis for days at a time across the Yellowstone and Grand\nTeton back country. And in the fall, if my park work ended\nearly, I worked at an elk hunting camp at a nearby national\nforest.\nBut it wasn't the daily adventures that had the most\nprofound effect on me. It was the political issues that swirled\naround every aspect of my job. Here was a place where\ndignitaries from around the world had traveled to attend the\nSecond World Conference on National Parks, and where the\nPresident of the United States came to relax. Up the road, in\nYellowstone, a raging debate was brewing over how to wean\ngrizzly bears off human garbage. And in the Tetons, vibrant\nconversation was underway about fire management, search and\nrescue, visitors' use, and resource protection.\nIn an effort to find a way to get more involved in these\nissues and others, I quit my park job and volunteered on a\ncampaign for Malcolm Wallop, who was running for the U.S.\nSenate from Wyoming. His race succeeded, and suddenly I had a\nfront-row seat to some of the most consequential energy,\nwildlife and natural resource issues in a generation.\nStarting my Senate career as an LA, following the EPW\ncommittee, and ending up as the minatory staff director of the\nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I was here when\nCongress tackled the Alaska Lands legislation, a crippling oil\nembargo, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, the Exxon\nValdez oil spill, the restructuring of the U.S. electricity\nindustry, controversial endangered species issues, such as the\nspotted owl and the snail darter, and much more.\nI also broadened my understanding of new park\nauthorizations, fee legislation, concession oversight and the\nimportance of timely communications with Congress, while\nheading the Park Service's office of congressional Relations.\nLater, as chief of staff to the Governor of Wyoming, I was in\nthe middle of wolf reintroduction in Yellowstone.\nI ended my time in Washington working for GE, where my\nprimary responsibility was leading a policy team that focused\non the deployment of clean energy technologies in the United\nStates and around the world. Over the years, I also became a\nchampion of public-private partnerships, through serving on\nboards of several natural resources organizations, whose\nmissions were to help fund infrastructure projects, augment\nwildlife research budgets, and provide opportunities for young\npeople to work and learn on our public lands. Today, I work on\nthe frontiers of the Endangered Species Act in southwestern\nWyoming, bringing ranchers, regulators, conservationists, and\nindustry leaders together to protect large-scale habitats of\nthe greater sage grouse, while removing barriers to multiple\nuse.\nAlong the way, I have learned so much, especially that no\none ever wins by winning everything, that bipartisan solutions\nare always the lasting solutions, and that the key success to\nmanagement is recruiting good people and trusting them to do\ntheir jobs.\nFinally, if confirmed, I want to stress my commitment to\nwork constructively with Congress on behalf of our parks,\nrefuges, fish, and wildlife. If well-meaning people engage in\ngood faith and communicate effectively, the benefit to these\nnational treasures can be unlimited.\nI thank you, and I look forward to your questions.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Wallace follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nSenator Barrasso. Thanks so much for your testimony.\nWelcome to your family here today.\nThroughout this hearing, and with questions for the record,\nthe committee members are going to have the opportunity to\nlearn more about your commitment to public service for our\ngreat Nation.\nI have to ask a couple of questions for the record, which\nwe do of all nominees. The first is, do you agree, if\nconfirmed, to appear before this committee or designated\nmembers of the committee and other appropriate committees of\nCongress and provide information, subject to appropriate and\nnecessary security protection, with respect to your\nresponsibilities?\nMr. Wallace. I do.\nSenator Barrasso. And do you agree to ensure that\ntestimony, briefings, documents and electronic and other forms\nof information are provided to this committee and its staff and\nother appropriate committees in a timely manner?\nMr. Wallace. Yes.\nSenator Barrasso. And do you know of any matters, which you\nmay or may not have disclosed, that might place you in any\nconflict of interest if you are confirmed?\nMr. Wallace. I do not.\nSenator Barrasso. I will now begin with questions. Then we\nwill alternate back and forth, Senator Carper will go after I\ndo.\nCan you just explain a little bit about how your\nexperiences that you have had prepared you to oversee the\nNational Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service? You\ntalked a bit about it in your opening statement. Anything else\nthat comes to mind in terms of specific experience? I know you\nhave been a rescue ranger, worked the back country, have seen\nit from all different levels.\nMr. Wallace. I think one of the great things about being\nhere at this time in my career is having seen a lot of\ndifferent aspects of both the Park Service and the Fish and\nWildlife Service and the Endangered Species Act, to the point\nwhere you see the power of good people coming together to solve\ncomplicated problems. I have seen that throughout my career. I\nknow you all work with it every day in the committee.\nBut it is the belief, as I said in my statement, people\nworking in good faith on complicated issues can achieve\nremarkable, good things.\nSenator Barrasso. And along that line, I think about the\nAmerican Water Infrastructure Act that we got through the\nSenate 99 to 1, it authorizes increased funding for things like\nwatercraft inspection stations, in order to stop the spread of\naquatic invasive species. The committee also led the enactment\nof the WILD Act, Wildlife Innovation and Longevity Driver Act,\nrequires the specific agencies to develop strategic plans to\nreduce invasive species, on lands that they manage, and\nprovides, actually, cash prizes for innovative solutions to\nbetter combat the invasive species.\nWhat is your assessment, if I could, of the invasive\nspecies threat to our Nation's wildlife in the national park\nsystem, and can we better use and coordinate efforts along\nthose lines?\nMr. Wallace. That is a question I have thought a lot about\nsince the President nominated me for this position. We have,\nSenator Barrasso, as you know, invasive species in Wyoming,\nwhether it is cheat grass or lake trout in Yellowstone or even\ntrying to prevent quagga mussels from getting into the Snake\nRiver drainage and getting all the way down into the Columbia\nRiver. Every time I heard the word invasive species, I think it\nis just going to turn out like a bad vampire movie, because it\nis something that whatever you do, you are not going to be able\nto curtail.\nI think, if confirmed for this position, it is a chance to\nreally think through what the departments are already doing,\nand see if we have to take our game up to a different level.\nBecause they are everywhere.\nSenator Barrasso. I am thinking about the time you were\nchief of staff for Governor Geringer. He served at the same\ntime Senator Carper was a Governor, so we have the State side\nof this, then we have the Federal side of it. Do you have any\nthoughts on how we can foster better coordination between\nFederal and State wildlife agencies? Because States are putting\na lot of money into wildlife efforts as well.\nMr. Wallace. I have. The word partner is a very easy word\nto say, we all say partner, but it is a lot harder to do. It\ntakes a lot of work. What do you mean by partnerships? It is\nrespecting the government-to-government partnerships between\ntribes and between States and sometimes local communities, it\nis respecting the partnerships between NGO's and conservation\ngroups that care deeply.\nAnd a partnership is a partnership. That is what you commit\nto, you work with a State, you get the best advice from the\nprofessionals that work on an issue, and you work\nconstructively toward a solution.\nSenator Barrasso. And I want to pick up on the word\npartnership, because, as you used it, under the leadership of\nthis committee, the reauthorization of what is the Partners for\nFish and Wildlife program was enacted into law in March. It is\na voluntary program encouraging U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\nand private landowners, because I had asked you about State and\nFederal, but I am talking about now U.S. Fish and Wildlife and\nprivate landowners to work together on habitat conservation and\nrestoration projects. Can you talk about proactive, voluntary\nconservation efforts, by landowners, private entities, when it\ncomes to protecting wildlife and their habitat?\nMr. Wallace. I look forward to working with you and the\ncommittee and others and implementing that Act, if confirmed.\nSenator Barrasso. So there is an important role, working\nwith the private landowners as well, and other private\nentities, in terms of working along those lines.\nAs Assistant Secretary, you are going to oversee both the\nFish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service.\nAlthough these agencies have fundamentally different missions,\nthe authorities often overlap, certainly on lands across the\nwest. You have seen it first-hand in Grand Teton and\nYellowstone National Parks. The lands provide habitat for\nimportant species and are also drivers of the local economies.\nYou see it all around Wyoming.\nIf confirmed, how would you balance the diverse and\nsometimes competing missions of these two different agencies\nthat you will oversee?\nMr. Wallace. I think, Senator, the issue there is the\ninteragency working groups that have come together on grizzly\nbears and others that we have seen throughout Wyoming and I am\nsure in other parts of the west. It is making sure those\ninteragency groups are working together, coordinating with one\nanother and not creating confusing data for the public to\ndigest and try and understand.\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you. Senator Carper.\nSenator Carper. I was happy to hear the name Jim Geringer.\nWe served together 6 years, I was elected in 1992, he was\nelected in 1994. Wonderful man, and it was a joy to serve with\nhim.\nI don't mean to ask a bunch of yes or no questions. I would\nask three of them, and then I'll ask questions that will take\nmore than yes or no to respond to.\nThe first question is, do you agree with our Nation's\nleading scientists, including those within the Department of\nInterior, who have concluded that climate change is real, is\ncaused in large part by humans, and is impacting fish, wildlife\nand parks? Do you agree with that?\nMr. Wallace. Senator, I do agree that climate change is an\nissue and that humans have a very important role in that\nsituation.\nSenator Carper. That is good. Thank you. Second question.\nDo you question the conclusions of the Fourth National Climate\nAssessment that stated our Nation's ecosystems and economy are\nat grave risk in the decades to come if we do not take climate\nactions today?\nMr. Wallace. Senator, to be perfectly honest, I haven't\nread the assessment. I am aware of it, along with the IPCC 1.5.\nYes, I am aware of the issues. I know that scientists are\nclearly moving in that direction. But to be fair, I have not\nread the report.\nSenator Carper. I will just ask you to answer again, for\nthe record.\nMr. Wallace. OK.\nSenator Carper. Thank you.\nLast yes or no question. Do you commit to this committee\nthat if confirmed, you will not directly or indirectly\ninterfere or undermine climate science?\nMr. Wallace. Senator, I believe in the importance of\nclimate science and the independence of science.\nSenator Carper. I will take that, thank you. Followup\nquestion, if I could. As Assistant Secretary for Fish and\nWildlife and Parks, what will you do to make our parks and\nrefuges more resilient in the face of climate change?\nMr. Wallace. Let me take a drink of water on that one.\nSenator Carper. I will say it again while you take a drink\nof water. As Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and\nParks, what will you do to make our parks and refuges more\nresilient in the face of climate change?\nMr. Wallace. Let me, if I could, sort of describe my job,\nif confirmed, how I see it, Senator. If you looked at the\ncombined assets of both the Fish and Wildlife Service and the\nNational Park Service, there is approximately 1,000 units in 50\nStates and 5 territories. If you look at, I guess one way I\nwould look at your climate question is, to understand where the\nstress is on all of these different agencies, or all of these\ndifferent areas, and have a system in place where you are\nsystematically evaluating how they stand.\nSo in the example of climate change, we know that the\nGovernor of Louisiana is trying to adapt for that anticipation\nby thinking of moving communities up off of southeastern\nLouisiana. You see the Fish and Wildlife Service doing coastal\nresiliency projects in North Carolina with oyster bed\nconstruction.\nIn Alaska, with melting sea ice, it is a completely\ndifferent sort of equation, and how do you evaluate it. And\nalso perhaps the coast of Oregon or Washington State, where\nthey are worried about ocean acidification.\nBut there are also other issues, I think, that adds stress\nto it that I could not ignore if in this position. We talked\nabout invasive species, what is habitat fragmentation doing to\nmigratory corridors in other parts. If you care deeply about\nhistoric areas in the National Park Service, what about\nbattlefields, like Champion Hills and Vicksburg that may be\nrounded out if the parks focus on that? So I certainly\nacknowledge the climate issue, and I also acknowledge that\nthere are other stressors within the system that I would also\nbe responsible for.\nBut let me tell you how I would look at all three of those.\nFirst of all, and foremost, follow the law. What does the law\nsay you have to do, can't do or should do? No. 1. No. 2 is,\nfollow the science. What are your professionals telling you\nabout how to solve these problems? And it is not just the\n50,000-foot science, it is the sort of on the ground science,\nby science managers, applied science, if you will. What are\nthey telling you to do about the problem?\nThen the third, and I talked about this with Senator\nBarrasso, I think it is very important, it is the role of\npartnerships. You can't solve scale problems unless you can\nfigure out how to be a good partner. Sometimes the Federal\nGovernment is the alpha and the partnership debate, and I don't\nthink that is the right construct, especially given so many\ninterests from so many groups around the Country to get\ninvolved.\nSenator Carper. We will take that question; I might come\nback with a question for the record and you can have a chance\nto think about it and respond further. If we have another round\nof questions, I will ask a few more questions. Thank you.\nSenator Barrasso. Senator Cramer.\nSenator Cramer. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank\nyou, Mr. Wallace, for being here.\nWhen Secretary Bernhardt was going through this same\nprocess, he and I dug in a little a little bit on a few issues\nthat, I don't want to call them North Dakota specific, but they\nare rather North Dakota-centric. One in particular that centers\naround the prairie pothole region, and what I think is somewhat\nof a unique situation for North Dakota, in that our farmers,\nover the last century or so, in our rectangle up there in the\nnorthern part of our Country, had been such great stewards of\nwater that they didn't drain a lot of land when it was vogue to\ndo that throughout the prairie. Consequently, sometimes I think\ntheir good actions earlier have been probably biting them a\nlittle bit.\nSo when it comes to specifically WPAs, or the watershed\nprotection area easements that some of our farmers have\ninherited from their great-grandfather or grandfathers, with\nthe lack of a clear delineation, historically poor mapping,\nwhat I consider an inadequate appeals process, lack of\nconsistency with NRCS, particularly Swampbuster, enforcement\ninconsistencies, I raised all these issues with the Secretary\nin hopes that we could work on together, between stakeholders,\npartners, politically diverging ideals, in a way to provide\nbetter clarity for our farmers and avoid what I consider\nsometimes to be enforcement or regulatory takings.\nWith your background, it seems to me you like have a great\nbackground. I was thinking specifically in fact about your sage\ngrouse habitat mitigation work. I would just sort of challenge\nyou at this level now and then we can certainly get into more\nspecifics at a later time, as you get into the job. Just\nlooking for ideas on how we can help these farmers, both within\nthe legal construct, but then with advice, and like I said, if\nthere is a mitigation plan that can accomplish everybody's\ngoals while at the same time allowing our farmers to continue\nto grow food for a growing world population.\nI just want to plant that seed with you and look forward to\na very specific discussion.\nAlso, by the way, the Secretary committed to coming out to\nvisit with our farmers. If you are confirmed prior to whenever\nthat trip takes place, it would be great if you could join him\non that trip. But first of all, just sort of in general, any\nthoughts about WPA easements and some work that we can maybe\nget done that again, accomplishes everybody's goals without\nfurther taking from our landowners?\nMr. Wallace. One of the great things about this job, if I\nam confirmed, is to think about issues that I don't know a lot\nabout. Right now, I can tell you this, Senator, if this is\nimportant to you, I will be committed to learning a lot more\nabout it, perhaps coming to visit with you and meet some of\nyour constituents and hear first-hand the challenges you have.\nAnd to the degree that it is within my ability in the\ndepartment to help, given the legal and scientific issues that\nwill also be there, more than happy to do that.\nSenator Cramer. I appreciate that. And I think one of the\nthings you bring to the job, and you and I had not met before,\nbut when you have such a strong endorsement as the two Senators\nfrom Wyoming have given, it is hard to argue with you, to be\nhonest, not just because he is the Chairman, because I am a\nmember of two Wyoming Senators' chairmanship, but because they\nare such quality people.\nYou seem to be able to bridge the political intricacies\npretty effectively. That is not a minor issue. As you point\nout, Delaware and Wyoming, we oftentimes find big differences.\nBut you seem to have that ability, and I would look forward to\ntapping into that capacity that you have to accomplish these\nthings.\nSo I am just going to leave it at that for now, but I look\nforward to further discussion.\nMr. Wallace. I look forward to learning more about it,\nSenator. Thank you.\nSenator Cramer. Thank you. I look forward to further\ndiscussion.\nSenator Carper. I would add that there is a Wyoming,\nDelaware. And it just south of Dover.\n[Laughter.]\nSenator Carper. I have great affection for Wyoming,\nDelaware.\nSenator Barrasso. Senator Braun.\nSenator Braun. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\nThis is always an enjoyable conversation for me, because I\npractice conservation and at home during our recess, will never\ngive up that part of it, get a few fishing trips in and so\nforth.\nI think it is sometimes overwhelming, invasive species. I\nhave been fighting them on my own properties for years. I\nwonder how far that has gotten out of hand to where we can\nmostly try to contain rather than eliminate. But I don't want\nto focus on that now, I want to focus on what I have observed\nover time and have you weigh in on it.\nTwice during the break, I saw bald eagles on private lakes\nwhere, my goodness, where until maybe 10, 12 years ago in\nIndiana, when I was on the White River, had not seen a bald\neagle. And now, they were doing so well, they are starting to\ncolonize a lot of small lakes and places where you never\nimagined.\nBeavers, I remember as a kid I saw one on Potoka Lake when\nI was about 15 years old. It was like a rare sighting. Deer\nwere basically extinct in Indiana until conservation efforts\nturned around.\nI noticed a lot of good stuff, including otters, to where\nnow there is an open season on otters, simply because they have\nbeen reintroduced and are doing so well. Bobcats would be on\nthe cusp.\nSo when we talk about fish and wildlife, weigh in on what\nis good that is happening. Because it is depressing, to be\nhonest, when we focus on invasive species. I know we need to,\njust, how do we grapple with it? Talk a little bit about what\nyou have observed over the last few decades and are really wins\nand pluses, put it in perspective with all the challenges we\nhave.\nMr. Wallace. Well, Senator, I have observed the same thing\nthat you have over time. When I was a ranger in the Grand\nTeton, the bald eagles were still at risk. Now, they are\nabundant. We have also seen in Wyoming peregrine falcons come\nback, black footed ferrets, through some very collaborative\nbreeding. Sage grouse, which a lot of us have been working to\nkeep off the endangered species list. Whooping cranes, grizzly\nbears have come back. They have come back in force in Wyoming.\nSo you sure look at the wise management of these wildlife\nlaws and say, it has been a success. At the same time, you want\nto know, what can we do better going forward, are there wiser\nways to manage, to think about species recovery. I am fully\naware that will be a responsibility of mine if confirmed for\nthis job.\nSenator Braun. So in general, then, I think it would be\nfair to say that some of the particulars of especially\nconservation and wildlife preservation, we have a lot of good\nthings to talk about. Would you view either invasive species\nand/or climate change as being things that in the near term\ncould set back any of that, where we have had such rapid\nprogression in the right direction? Do you view either one of\nthose, because I agree both are intractable issues. We have to\nfind out a way to deal with them.\nDo you see any of the gains we have made in somewhat\nimmediate threat, or do you think that is in the longer context\nas well?\nMr. Wallace. That is a great question, and I think about\nit, too, because climate is on the minds of lots of people, the\npublic, members. If you look at what is happening in the\nFlorida Everglades with the Burmese python, there are songbirds\nat risk of blinking out down there because of that invasive\nspecies. In Wyoming, about 25 years ago, a bucket biologist\ndumped a bunch of lake trout into Yellowstone Lake, as\npredators of one of the world's richest natural cutthroat\npopulations anywhere in the world. Pound for pound, lake trout\nwins every time over a cutthroat. That was an important food\ngroup for the grizzly bears during the spawning. It really\nstarted to upset the entire balance of Yellowstone.\nIt took biologists a number of years to figure out they had\nan invasive species problem, and then what to do about it. It\nwas more than just letting everybody go out and catch as many\nlake trout as they wanted. Because the lake trout were winning\nthat fight every day. They finally brought commercial seiners\nin from the Great Lakes that are catching hundreds of thousands\nof lake trout a year. I talked to the superintendent a few days\nago, he said they put as much in gill netting down in\nYellowstone Lake every year to stretch from Yellowstone to\nNaples, Florida, just to get a handle on an invasive species.\nSo it goes to your point, Senator, that I think the Federal\nagencies and State agencies need to be observant to identifying\na potential risk, is it coming, what can you do to prevent it.\nIf it is here, how do you stabilize it, and then what do you do\nto reverse it. Those threats, I believe there is an Asian Carp\nCoalition here from members in the Mississippi and the Great\nLakes. It is a big issue. I would be glad to have support to\nthink seriously about that.\nSenator Braun. Thank you.\nMr. Wallace. Thank you, Senator.\nSenator Barrasso. Senator Markey, welcome.\nSenator Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much.\nThe Monomoy Refuge, Mr. Wallace, in 2015, the Fish and\nWildlife Service finalized a revised comprehensive conservation\nplan for the Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge that\nreinterpreted the refuge boundaries to include the waters and\nsubmerged lands to the west of the refuge. This potentially\nmakes it harder for Chatham residents to moor fishing boats,\nhunt or collect shellfish in those waters as they have been\ndoing so for years.\nThe Trump Administration has advocated for more\nrecreational access to public lands, refuges and parks. But in\nthe Monomoy Refuge, the Town of Chatham and its residents are\nconcerned that they are losing their longstanding access.\nMr. Wallace, if confirmed, will you commit to working with\nme to ensure public access, while also protecting the\nenvironment in this special place?\nMr. Wallace. Senator, I will. I know this is a very\nimportant issue to you. You have raised it at Interior. I have\nhad a chance to learn a little bit about it by speaking with\nyour staff recently. If it would be helpful, I would be happy\nto come up there with you to meet with the people in Chatham\nand understand it first-hand. Thank you.\nSenator Markey. Yes, the town of Chatham has been a great\nsteward of these waters, dating back more than 60 years. I am a\nstrong supporter of our national refuges and believe that our\nbeautiful lands and waters deserve protection. It is my hope\nthat we can find a resolution to this issue that continues to\nprotect and safeguard this unique piece of our Country. So I\nwould appreciate it if you would come.\nMr. Wallace, if you are confirmed, you would be in charge\nof our parks and refuges, a collection of national treasures\nthat belong to all Americans. As Senator Carper has already\nnoted in his questions, climate change is threatening these\nbeautiful wild places. Rainfall is down, wildfires are up, bark\nbeetles and pathogens are spreading and species are\ndisappearing.\nMr. Wallace, to followup on Senator Carper's conversation\nwith you, will you commit to addressing the climate crisis as\npart of your management of our national parks, wildlife,\nrefuges, if confirmed?\nMr. Wallace. Senator, yes. The key, as I mentioned earlier,\nthere are three stools to this. You have to adapt and to\nmoderate the consequences of not only climate, but invasive\nspecies. But to do that within the law, with what the\nscientists are telling us and to work in strong partnership to\ndo that work.\nSenator Markey. Yes, I just don't think it is possible to\nresponsible stewards and conservationists if we are not dealing\nwith the consequences of the climate crisis. It just goes hand\nin glove for the rest of our lives. We have to responsibly deal\nwith that.\nThe State of Alaska is proposing the development of a 200-\nmile industrial road that would cut through the gates of the\nArctic National Preserve and bisect one of the longest land\nmigration routes in the world. Western Arctic caribou herd\ntravels as far as 2,700 miles a year from their wintering\ngrounds along the Bering Sea to their calving grounds on the\nArctic coastal plain. This migration is longer than the\ndistance between New York and Seattle, and it could be cutoff\nif this road moves forward.\nMr. Wallace, are you aware of this proposal and the\nplanning process currently underway?\nMr. Wallace. Senator, I am actually not that familiar. Of\ncourse, from the news, but I haven't been down to the\nDepartment of Interior yet, having just been the nominee for 22\ndays. But I know this is an issue that will be in my office and\nI will be quickly getting up to speed on it.\nSenator Markey. Obviously, this road is going to have a\nhuge impact on wildlife and public lands in the region. So we\nare going to be working with you on this overseeing what is\ngoing to be taking place here. Because it could have severe\nadverse impacts in that region. We are just going to be\nexpecting you to work with us to make sure that damage does not\noccur.\nSo thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much.\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you very much, Senator Markey.\nWe are fortunate to have joining us now the Senator from\nAlaska, who may have some input on that very issue.\nSenator Sullivan. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I really\nlove my colleague, Ed Markey. He and I work together on a bunch\nof things. But his attention to Alaska sometimes astounds me.\n[Laughter.]\nSenator Sullivan. Because with all due respect to the\nSenator from Alaska, I care a hell of a lot more about Alaska\nand my constituents than he does. So I am just trying to get\nthe numbers of miles of roads that Alaska has relative to\nMassachusetts. My State is probably, well, I know it is 491\ntimes the size of Rhode Island.\nSenator Whitehouse. Yes, you had to say that.\n[Laughter.]\nSenator Sullivan. But it is probably at least 200 times the\nsize of Massachusetts. And I guarantee you, Massachusetts has\nmore roads than my State. So most Alaskans really want roads.\nAnd here is the thing. Unfortunately, radical environmental\ngroups always do this, oh, my God, everything is going to die\nwhen you build a road, a damned road. In most States, you can\nbuild a road anywhere you want, and you don't have 80\nenvironmental groups suing to stop it. But in my State, you try\nto build a road, one damned road, and you will have so many\noutside groups who don't care about my constituents, suing to\nstop a road.\nMost people just assume you can build a road anywhere in\nAmerica. Can't build a road in Alaska, though, because of\ncolleagues like my friend, good friend Ed Markey, who want to\nstop roads.\nSenator Barrasso. What is the number on the roads?\nSenator Sullivan. We have a third the number of miles of\nroads than Massachusetts, and we are probably at least 200\ntimes the size of the State. So just take that one there, Mr.\nWallace. We are going to be working on making sure--and by the\nway, when you hear the parade of horribles, remember last time\nthere was a parade of horrible on the porcupine caribou herd is\nwhen we built the Trans-Alaska pipeline, one of the most\nimportant features of American energy independence in certainly\nour Country.\nThe parade of horribles was the porcupine caribou herd was\ngoing to be destroyed. It increased four times the size when\nthe pipeline was built. Now, you never hear the radical\nenvironmental groups saying that, because it wasn't true. The\nsame stuff is going on with the development of Anwar, which you\nare going to have a role in, which this Congress passed, the\nPresident signed, the Alaskan people want it, almost 70 percent\nwant it.\nSo we are going to work with you on that as well. But don't\nbelieve the hype. We need roads in Alaska. They are not going\nto harm the caribou. And the outside groups that want to shut\ndown Alaska, who none of them live there, by the way, you are\ngoing to listen to my constituents more than those groups,\nbecause my constituents want roads, we need roads.\nThis just kind of aggravates me, as you can see. I have so\nmany Senators caring about roads in my State, when they have a\nlot more roads than my State does. And it is not fair, it is\nnot fair. You can't build a road in Alaska, because outside\ngroups stop to sue it, sue to stop it. It is outrageous. I wish\nthey would come and sue when you guys in Rhode Island or\nMassachusetts wanted to build a road. Nobody sues to stop\nbuilding roads in your States. But they all come to my State.\nSo we are going to work on that, and we are going to build\nthat road. And it is not going to hurt the caribou at all.\nSo let me get to my questions. Mr. Wallace, the Supreme\nCourt recently ruled nine to zero, Elena Kagan in a landmark\ndecision for Alaska in a case just recently, called Sturgeon v.\nFrost, which was about ANILCA. I am sure you are familiar with\nANILCA, another huge Federal law that tried to lock up Alaska\npassed in 1980. To just kind of--well, first, have you read the\nSturgeon v. Frost case?\nMr. Wallace. Senator, I have not.\nSenator Sullivan. So before we vote on your confirmation, I\nthink it is critical that you read that decision. Can I get\nyour commitment that you will?\nMr. Wallace. If it is important to you, Senator, I will do\nthat, yes.\nSenator Sullivan. It is a really important case. It\nessentially says that for decades, ANILCA has not been\nimplemented correctly by Federal agencies, Fish and Wildlife\nService, National Park Service. So I would like to get a\ncommitment with you, this is a nine to zero Supreme Court case,\nto work with me as you look to revise your regulations that\nwould implement the holding of the U.S. Supreme Court nine to\nzero in Sturgeon v. Frost. Can I get your commitment to work\nwith me and my office on that?\nMr. Wallace. Senator, if it is an important issue to you,\nit will be an important issue to me.\nSenator Barrasso. Can I interrupt for 1 second, Senator?\nSo, ANILCA, for those of us, it is the Alaska National Interest\nLands Conservation Act passed in 1980.\nSenator Sullivan. Correct.\nSenator Barrasso. For some other members of the committee\nand the audience. Thank you.\nSenator Sullivan. Thank you. And let me ask, I know I am\nrunning out of time, I didn't think I was going to talk about\nroads, but my colleague got me spun up on that.\nWe have a problem in southeast Alaska with sea otters,\nwhich have grown in enormous numbers in terms of population.\nThey are not listed as endangered. And they are having a very\nnegative impact on a very important industry in southeast\nAlaska, shellfish, fin fish, fisheries. I was just in southeast\nAlaska the last couple of weeks and this issue is reaching kind\nof an emergency level proportions.\nCan I get your commitment, Mr. Wallace, if confirmed, to\nwork with me and my office on addressing this big issue with\nregard to the sea otter population and its negative impact on\nfisheries in Alaska, which is really, like I said, reaching\ncrisis proportions?\nMr. Wallace. Senator, this is marine mammal issue on taking\nwith the sea otter.\nSenator Sullivan. It is, and it is also the decimation that\nthey have had with regard to the fishing industry. But the Fish\nand Wildlife Service has oversight and responsibility as it\nrelates to this issue.\nMr. Wallace. I commit to learning a lot more about this\nissue than I know now, and be back to visit with you about it.\nSenator Sullivan. Great. Thank you. Thank you, Mr.\nChairman.\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you, Senator Sullivan. Senator\nWhitehouse.\nSenator Whitehouse. Thank you, Chairman.\nWelcome, Mr. Wallace. The Chairman speaks very highly of\nyou and says that I am probably going to like you. He is a very\nhonorable man and I appreciate that very much.\nYou do suffer the catastrophic disability of being from a\nlandlocked State, however.\n[Laughter.]\nSenator Whitehouse. But I think your sense of nature and\nher beauty is probably animated every time you wake up and see\nthe glow of the dawn on the Tetons. You certainly do come from\na special place in the world.\nI wanted to ask you a little bit about a local issue, and\nthen an oceans issue. The local issue is that we have a\nBlackstone Valley park that has been worked on for some time.\nIt is still being fully defined. And unlike other national\nparks where you start with basically a big empty piece of land,\nyou draw the metes and bounds and you say, that is a park now,\nthis park exists in a very developed environment. It is a\nseries of specific locations threaded through by the historic\nBlackstone River. It runs up into Massachusetts as well.\nIt has been described as like a pearl necklace with all\nthese different pearls along the way, and the thread that ties\nthem together is the river. But it has been through being a\nprotected area, it has been through being a national protected\nriver, it has been through a whole variety of iterations on its\nway to becoming a national park.\nSo it is not an easy thing to run through. There are a lot\nof bureaucratic hooks and attachment, there is a lot of stuff\ngoing on. And you have to think about park land in a slightly\nnew way to adapt it to the existing developed environment this\npark will inhabit.\nSo I am going to need to be able to talk to you about that,\nand to get your attention. Because this is not the type of park\nyou are used to out west, where you come to the gate and there\nis the park ranger, and in you go and now you are on park land.\nThis is a very different idea of how you can make a park work.\nAnd not only are we trying to thread the river through all of\nthis, we are trying to make sure that the river is traversable\nthrough all of this area, so that there are put-ins and take-\nouts for canoes, and for people who don't want to do that, that\nthere are bike paths that connect all of this.\nAnd all of this is through built areas, and in-built areas.\nSo it has been a long, long, long, long, long, slow, process I\njust want to make sure that you will take a good look at this\nwhen you get in. I want the chance to come and talk you through\nwhat this has been and where we are trying to get, so that you\nunderstand that the command level, the complexities of closing\nout this particular park and launching it as a crown jewel of\nNew England.\nMr. Wallace. Senator, I look forward to working with you,\nif confirmed, on this issue. We will certainly know more about\nit the next time we see each other than I do right now.\nSenator Whitehouse. Yes. Well, thank you, and we will get\ntogether on that.\nMr. Wallace. OK.\nSenator Whitehouse. The other issue I want to talk with you\nabout is oceans. Again, from Wyoming, we are always a little\nbit suspicious of landlocked States and how much interest they\nwill have in oceans. The Department of Interior has a long,\nlong history of focusing on the west and on inland and upland\nissues, without paying much attention to coastal issues. We are\nnow seeing dramatic coastal changes, driven by sea level rise,\ntemperature change, acidification, the concerns that you have\nmentioned already.\nBut it makes the coasts a matter of real concern. And I\nwanted to let you know that not only is it a matter of really\ngrave concern, but it is also a matter of real bipartisan\nopportunity. Ocean plastics is a critical issue. The Interior\nDepartment website talks about the eight million tons of\nplastic waste that gets dumped in the oceans every year. The\nPresident signed Senator Sullivan's and my legislation in a\nvery, how shall we say, lively Oval Office ceremony. It passed\nunanimously in the Senate. It passed on suspension in the\nHouse. We are working on another one that we are hoping will\npass unanimously. Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma has been one of\nour key supporters on all of this.\nSo what I want you to take away from this is a, we are\ngoing to be coming after you on oceans. You need to pay\nattention to this. It is not just upland and inland any longer.\nAnd b, there are big, big bipartisan opportunities for you to\nhelp lead and to support in this area. We are often a divided\ncommittee. On these oceans issues, acidification, plastics, sea\nlevel rise, coastal wetlands, there is enormous potential.\nSeize the day.\nMr. Wallace. Again, this is an area, as you noted, I am\nfrom a landlocked State. But I am certainly aware of the issues\nthat members like you in the coastal States are grappling with.\nI look forward to learning a lot more about what we are doing\nat the Department of Interior, the opportunity for\npartnerships, coastal resiliency issues. Thank you, I will be\nsmarter on that one, too, the next time I see you.\nSenator Whitehouse. And some day, Mr. Chairman, we might\neven change the name so it is not just the Department of the\nInterior.\n[Laughter.]\nSenator Whitehouse. There are some edges that count too.\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse. And\nheading to one of those edges, welcome back, Senator Sullivan.\nSenator Sullivan. Mr. Chairman, thanks again. Mr. Wallace,\nI just want to reiterate what my friend, Senator Whitehouse,\nmentioned. There is a great opportunity, we will be introducing\nour Save Our Seas 2.0 legislation here soon, where we think\nthere is a great bipartisan opportunity. The President and the\nAdministration are really engaged on these issues. And it is\nactually an environmental issue that is solvable. Estimates are\nanywhere up from ten rivers, five countries in Asia constitute\nover 80 percent of the plastic ocean waste in the world.\nSo there is a lot we can do. Senator Whitehouse has really\nbeen the leader on this in the Senate. He and I have been\nworking together the last several years on it. We want to bring\nyou in on that. It is a great area of bipartisan cooperation\nwith everybody on board, industry, environmental groups, the\nTrump Administration, Democrats, Republicans. I think we\nshould, as he mentioned, seize the day. So we will have a good\nopportunity to talk about this in our followup meeting\ntomorrow, I think.\nSenator Whitehouse. And I would just commend the Chairman\nand the Ranking Member for their bipartisan engagement on this\nissue as well. It has really been terrific.\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse.\nSenator Braun?\nSenator Braun. Thank you. I have a bill that proposes that\nwe take a defined inventory on the maintenance that is required\non Federal properties. Indiana Dunes is now a national park. It\nwas up there a few weeks ago. One of the original homesteads in\nthat area, which was used by the State, it has fallen into\ndisrepair, several million dollars' worth of cost.\nWhat is your opinion on the need to size up to see what the\ncost is? It is maybe estimated $15 billion to $20 billion, no\none really knows. Do you think with an asset base that large,\nthat we ought to have an inventory of what the maintenance\nneeds would be?\nMr. Wallace. Senator, again, having not been down to the\ndepartment yet, it is one of those issues that I would like to\ntake back to the professionals down there to see how they are\nthinking about this issue. You are certainly, your question\nmakes a lot of sense. You ought to know what you are trying to\nfix before you go fix something. Just on the surface of what\nyou just told me, it makes eminently good sense.\nSenator Braun. I would like you to keep that in the\nconsideration. Once the process is concluded and you are there,\nI would like you to keep that in mind. Because I think it is\nimportant, that is a huge figure. We need to know what it is\nand then start tackling the problem. Thank you.\nMr. Wallace. Thank you, Senator.\nSenator Barrasso. Senator Carper.\nSenator Carper. Mr. Wallace, as I mentioned in my opening\nstatement, Delaware is real proud of, not of the fact that we\nwere the last State to have a national park designated, but we\nwere the first State, Delaware was the first State to ratify\nthe Constitution. For seven whole days, Delaware was the entire\nUnited States of America.\nAnd we opened things up, we let in Maryland, Pennsylvania,\nNew Jersey, and I think it has turned out all right most of the\ntime. But our national park actually focuses on Delaware's\nhistorical, the arrival of the first Swedes and Finns to\nAmerica, in Delaware, the Dutch presence in Lewes, Delaware.\nThe last, I believe, the oldest standing house in America is in\nLewes, Delaware. William Penn came to America in New Castle,\nDelaware, brought with him the deeds to what ultimately became\nPennsylvania and Delaware. And the Constitution was first\nratified in Dover, Delaware on December 7th, 1787.\nThe National park in Delaware actually tells part of the\nhistory of our Country through the eyes of Delaware and through\nthose sites and places in Delaware that I have just mentioned.\nThe National Park Service has identified a location for a\nvisitor center at the park, but has not yet committed to move\nto design and construction. The park is also in need of\nadditional signage and a deer management plan. I would just ask\nyou, if you might be willing to come and visit, if confirmed,\nto visit our State and take a look at our park and some of what\nwe are really proud of, and also some of our needs.\nMr. Wallace. Senator, I would be honored to do that. Thank\nyou for the invitation.\nSenator Carper. You are welcome. Thank you for the answer.\nMr. Wallace. It is a yes, it is a yes.\nSenator Carper. Next question. The Trump Administration has\nreassigned, I am told, several dozens of senior executive\nservice employees. Some of these employees were outspoken,\napparently, on climate change. A number of the reassignments\nhave been perceived as retaliatory. Rather than accept\nreassignment, several of these dedicated public servants\nultimately left the department.\nAs Assistant Secretary, would you be willing to provide to\nCongress detailed information about the rationale behind any\nfuture SES reassignments upon request? I am not asking about\npast, looking back. Not retrospective, but in perspective.\nMr. Wallace. My sense, Senator, is that there would be a\nlot of privacy information. But again, I am not down there, I\nam not aware of, I am certainly aware because of the news about\nthe SES issues. I would tell you personally I value greatly the\nSES people that I have run across during my time in government.\nI just don't know enough about this issue to make a commitment\none way or the other about it. I am sorry, but I don't.\nSenator Carper. All right. Then I am going to ask, would\nyou commit to protect career staff at the Department of\nInterior, moving forward, and to bolster their expertise\ninstead of suppressing it?\nMr. Wallace. I am sorry, could you give me that question\nagain, please?\nSenator Carper. Would you commit to protect career staff at\nthe Department of the Interior, and bolster their expertise\ninstead of suppressing it?\nMr. Wallace. I absolutely would. I am a big believer in the\nSES program. We have seen the caliber of the leaders that have\ncome through, both in the Fish and Wildlife Service and the\nPark Service, they are just the tops. So I am a strong\nproponent of that. I also want a pipeline in place, so if\nsomebody moves on, retires, takes another job, there is a bench\nto come in and fill behind them of equally capable people.\nSo yes, sir.\nSenator Carper. Thank you. And one last question. People\ntravel from around the world to view birds and other wildlife\nat our two national wildlife refuges that sit right on the\nDelaware Bay. Bombay Hook is one of them, and the other is\ncalled Prime Hook. These special refuges employ less than a\ndozen people, and they have hundreds of acres, cover hundreds\nand hundreds of acres. But they employ less than a dozen\npeople. The staff works hard to maintain the refuges and makes\nsure they remain accessible to the public.\nAmong other important positions, our refuges have a visitor\nservices coordinator and a law enforcement official. As the\nTrump Administration continues Department of Interior\nreorganization efforts, would you commit to us today that\nrefuge employees, like Delaware's, will not lose critical staff\nas a result? And how will you work with refuge managers and\nproject leaders to make sure their staffing needs are met?\nMr. Wallace. I would be able to answer this, Senator\nCarper, in a general way, but also with a commitment, if we\nmake that visit to the national park together, maybe also talk\nmore and see more about the issue that you just raised with me\npersonally. But we need motivated men and women in the National\nPark Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service that get up\nevery day and whistle while they go to work.\nSenator Carper. Like we do here in the Senate.\n[Laughter.]\nMr. Wallace. Exactly. I will do it in my job, if confirmed.\n[Laughter.]\nMr. Wallace. So the health and well-being and the training\nand the morale, there would be 3,000 people under the Assistant\nSecretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, who are all going to\nbe an important priority to me in terms of their training and\ntheir morale. I will be happy to learn more about the people in\nthe refuge system that you just spoke of.\nSenator Carper. We appreciate your answers. We probably\nhave a couple of questions for the record, and if confirmed, we\nlook forward to welcoming you, and perhaps your family, to the\nFirst State. Thanks very much.\nSenator Barrasso. I want to thank you, Senator Carper.\nI do have a letter of support for the nomination of Rob\nWallace from the National Wildlife Refuge Association. It is\nfrom Geoffrey Haskett, he is the president of the association,\nwho writes, ``We believe Mr. Wallace has the background,\nexperience, and leadership abilities to perform in an\nexceptional manner in the position of Assistant Secretary.'' I\nask unanimous consent to enter this letter into the record.\nSenator Carper. I object.\n[Laughter.]\nSenator Barrasso. Then I have 40 more. And they are\nwonderful letters----\nSenator Carper. I don't object.\n[Laughter.]\nSenator Barrasso [continuing]. of over sportsmen,\nenvironmental, and conservation groups have written in support\nof the nomination of Rob Wallace. These groups universally\npraised Rob's work experience, his knowledge of our Nation's\npublic lands and wildlife. And I ask unanimous consent to enter\nthese into the record.\n[The referenced material follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\nSenator Barrasso. And speaking of whistling your way to\nwork, I noticed joining us in the back of the room is Kathi\nWise, 40 years worked with Malcolm Wallop, worked with you as a\nmember of the staff of Senator Wallop's team. Remains a stellar\nemployee, whistles while she comes to work every day, really a\ntreasure of the Senate. I just want to know if she has always\nhad that kind of dedication and hard work and such character\nand credibility, or is that something you instilled in her as\nshe was working with you as Malcolm's chief of staff? Or has\nthat always been a part of her life?\nMr. Wallace. It is a legacy issue, Senator.\n[Laughter.]\nSenator Barrasso. Thank you for being here, thank you for\nbringing your family and so many friends. The opportunity for\nother members to put questions in for the record, we ask that\nthey submit questions for the record by Thursday, June 6th,\nclose of business. The nominee should respond to the questions\nby June 12th.\nI want to thank you and congratulate you, thank you for\nyour time and thank you for your testimony today.\nCongratulations.\n[Whereupon, at 11:23 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]\n[all]"
