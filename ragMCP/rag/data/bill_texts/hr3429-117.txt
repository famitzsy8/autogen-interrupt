SEC. 2. CONTRIBUTORY LIABILITY FOR ELECTRONIC COMMERCE PLATFORMS.
(a) Platform Liability.--Section 32 of the Act entitled ``An Act to
provide for the registration and protection of trademarks used in
commerce, to carry out the provisions of certain international
conventions, and for other purposes'', approved July 5, 1946 (commonly
known as the ``Trademark Act of 1946'') (15 U.S.C. 1114), is amended by
inserting at the end the following:
``(4)(A) Subject to subparagraph (C), an electronic
commerce platform shall be deemed contributorily liable in a
civil action by the registrant for the remedies hereinafter
provided for a case in which without the consent of the
registrant, a third-party seller uses in commerce a counterfeit
mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale,
distribution, or advertising of goods that implicate health and
safety on the platform, unless the platform demonstrates that
the platform took each of the following steps to prevent such
use on the platform before any infringing act by the third-
party seller:
``(i) Determined after a reasonable investigation,
and reasonably periodically confirmed--
``(I) that the third-party seller
designated a registered agent in the United
States for service of process; or
``(II) in the case of third-party seller
located in the United States, and if the seller
has not designated a registered agent under
subclause (I), that the third-party seller has
designated a verified address for service of
process in the United States.
``(ii) Verified through governmental identification
or other reliable documentation the identity, principal
place of business, and contact information of the
third-party seller.
``(iii) Required the third-party seller to--
``(I) take reasonable steps to verify the
authenticity of goods on or in connection with
which a registered mark is used; and
``(II) attest to the platform that the
third-party seller has taken reasonable steps
to verify the authenticity of the goods under
subclause (I).
``(iv) Imposed on the third-party seller as a
condition of participating on the platform contractual
requirements that--
``(I) the third-party seller agrees not to
use a counterfeit mark in connection with the
sale, offering for sale, distribution, or
advertising of goods on the platform;
``(II) the third-party seller consents to
the jurisdiction of United States courts with
respect to claims related to the third-party
seller's participation on the platform; and
``(III) the third-party seller designates
an agent for service of process in the United
States, or, in the case of third-party seller
located in the United States, the third-party
seller designates a verified address for
service of process in the United States.
``(v) Displayed conspicuously on the platform the
verified principal place of business, contact
information, and identity of the third-party seller,
and the country from which the goods will be shipped,
except the platform shall not be required to display
any such information that constitutes the personal
identity of an individual, a home street address, or
personal contact information of an individual, and in
such cases shall instead provide alternative, verified
means of contacting the third-party seller.
``(vi) Displayed conspicuously in each listing the
country of origin and manufacture of the goods, unless
such information was not reasonably available to the
third-party seller and the third-party seller had
identified to the platform the steps it undertook to
identify the country of origin and manufacture of the
goods and the reasons it was unable to identify the
same.
``(vii) Required each third-party seller to use
images that the seller owns or has permission to use
and that accurately depict the actual goods offered for
sale on the platform.
``(viii) Implemented at no cost to the registrant
reasonable proactive technological measures for
screening goods before displaying the goods to the
public to prevent any third-party seller's use of a
counterfeit mark in connection with the sale, offering
for sale, distribution, or advertising of goods on the
platform.
``(ix) Implemented at no cost to the registrant a
program to expeditiously disable or remove from the
platform any listing for which a platform has
reasonable awareness of use of a counterfeit mark in
connection with the sale, offering for sale,
distribution, or advertising of goods. Reasonable
awareness of use of a counterfeit mark may be inferred
based on information regarding the use of a counterfeit
mark on the platform generally, general information
about the third-party seller, identifying
characteristics of a particular listing, or other
circumstances as appropriate. A platform may reinstate
a listing disabled or removed under this clause if,
after an investigation, the platform reasonably
determines that a counterfeit mark was not used in the
listing. A reasonable decision to reinstate a listing
shall not be a basis for finding that a platform failed
to comply with this clause.
``(x) Implemented a policy that requires
termination of a third-party seller that has reasonably
been determined to have engaged in repeated use of a
counterfeit mark in connection with the sale, offering
for sale, distribution, or advertising of goods on the
platform. Use of a counterfeit mark by a third-party
seller in three separate listings within one year shall
be considered repeated use, except when reasonable
mitigating circumstances exist. A platform may
reinstate a third-party seller if, after an
investigation, the platform reasonably determines that
the third-party seller did not engage in repeated use
of a counterfeit mark or that reasonable mitigating
circumstances existed. A reasonable decision to
reinstate a third-party seller shall not be a basis for
finding that a platform failed to comply with this
clause.
``(xi) Implemented at no cost to the registrant
reasonable technological measures for screening third-
party sellers to ensure that sellers who have been
terminated do not rejoin or remain on the platform
under a different seller identity or alias.
``(xii) Provided a verified basis to contact a
third-party seller upon request by a registrant that
has a bona fide belief that the seller has used a
counterfeit mark in connection with the sale, offering
for sale, distribution, or advertising of goods on the
platform except that the platform is not required to
provide information that constitutes the personal
identity of an individual, a home street address, or
personal contact information of an individual (in such
case, the provider shall provide an alternative means
of contacting the third-party seller).
``(B) In this paragraph:
``(i) The term `counterfeit mark' has the meaning
given that term in section 34(d)(1)(B).
``(ii) The term `electronic commerce platform'
means any electronically accessed platform that
includes publicly interactive features that allow for
arranging the sale, purchase, payment, or shipping of
goods, or that enables a person other than an operator
of such platform to sell or offer to sell physical
goods to consumers located in the United States.
``(iii) The term `goods that implicate health and
safety' means goods the use of which can lead to
illness, disease, injury, serious adverse event,
allergic reaction, or death if produced without
compliance with all applicable Federal, State, and
local health and safety regulations and industry-
designated testing, safety, quality, certification,
manufacturing, packaging, and labeling standards.
``(iv) The term `third-party seller' means a person
other than the electronic commerce platform who uses
the platform to arrange for the sale, purchase,
payment, or shipping of goods.
``(C) This paragraph shall apply--
``(i) to an electronic commerce platform that has
annual sales on the platform of $500,000 or more; or
``(ii) to an electronic commerce platform with less
than $500,000 in annual sales six months after the
platform has received ten notices (in which there is a
reference to this paragraph and an explicit
notification to the platform of the ten-notice limit),
in aggregate, identifying listings on the platform that
reasonably could be determined to have used a
counterfeit mark in connection with the sale, offering
for sale, distribution, or advertising of goods that
implicate health or safety.
``(D) Nothing in this paragraph may be construed to limit
liability in a context other than that outlined in this
paragraph, including any cause of action available under other
provisions of this Act, notwithstanding that the same facts may
give rise to a claim under this paragraph.''.
(b) Effective Date.--This Act and the amendment made by this Act
shall take effect one year after the date of the enactment of this Act.
