# Codebase of the Bachelor Thesis

Currently the codebase is organized in the following manner:

## Main base

- `agents`: Contains the multi-agent experiments
- `ragMCP`: main logic of the MCP server

## Analysis & Experiments

- `mcp_analysis`: Where the experiments for the MCP functions are done. Contains more functions than in `congressMCP`
- `helper`: Experiments that give us helpful information for all the subdirectories
