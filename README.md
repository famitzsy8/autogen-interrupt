# Codebase of the Bachelor Thesis

Currently the codebase is organized like this:

## Main base

- `congressMCP`: main logic of MCP functions

## Analysis & Experiments
- `mcp_analysis`: Where the experiments for the MCP functions are done. Contains more functions than in `congressMCP`
- `helper`: Experiments that give us helpful information for all the subdirectories
